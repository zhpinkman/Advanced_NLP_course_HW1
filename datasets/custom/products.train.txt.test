The product is great, I already have the uni-lateral one and it rocks, so i wanted to buy the BI- Lateral aka 2.. --- and two times they have sent me UNI ones that were labeled as BI.. So your  best bet is to bi 2 uni's by themselves until amazon fixes the problem..	neg

I absolutely loved this game. I couldn't stay off my computer, it was addicting. The game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking, It was very entertaining and I would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery. I can't wait until the next one comes out	pos

This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of the first and this and enjoy	pos

I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky. Besides, the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north. So, you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time... ---  --- I am going to return this watch..	neg
My son had an earlier version of Math Blaster, it was wonderful.  I saw this new version and expected more of the same.  WRONG!!  After 10 minutes of loud sounds, and pulsing video, he was complaining.  It was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff. Never could get to a point where learning might take place.  Wish I could get my money back.   ---  --- After this disaster, we purchased Mia's Math Adventure. This was more in tune with the first Math Blaster. 	neg
This is the best study product I have found for reading notes quickly and accurately. Even a group of college students can have a good time drilling with these cards.

And it's a lot neater then when we tried to make our own	pos
I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama. And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially Lucious and Ivy. ---  --- The scary moments just added to the drama. Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can be. I loved all the twists to the story. ---  --- The only thing I didn't like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie would've moved along at a better pace. ---  --- But still a great movie	pos
The item is sloppy looking and feeling, unlike the photo of the black Ellaroo.  I didn't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip. Maybe I just never got it adjusted correctly but I read the instructions and gave it many tries.  However, on a positive note, I was refunded my money with no problem.  There was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front.  So, I have no problem with the seller. 	neg

I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it.

The Jellifish is the first radically new thing I've seen for guitar since the Ebow. I love innovative musical tools, and the Jellifish delivers. I am a guitar instructor and teach over 50 students a week from beginner to very advanced. I have had all of my students purchase the Jellifish because in order to get the Chorus! Pluck! and Bow! sounds you must master 3 picking styles that every guitarist should know how to use regardless. Specifically, a fluid, sweep picking technique will produce a lush chorusing effect that is a cross somewhere between a 12-string and a chorus pedal. Alternate picking, when done properly from the wrist, will produce the Pluck! effect, which somewhat sounds like a hammered dulcimer. And circular picking -- done from the thumb and forefinger -- will obtain a bowed effect that is very nice on slower, scalar patterns, but can also be used on arpeggios. 100 years from now, the Jellifish won't be novel, because every guitarist will use this the same as they do capos and slides. Minimal proficiency with this device is de rigueur for any serious student of the instrument	pos
I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. I've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. This takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza, and when the dough is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion. ---  --- Like most engineered products of our age, this one is full of cute features that add little value, or cause annoyance. ---  --- The yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. If you use it, you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later.  ---  --- The dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. They make a marginal difference in baking results. I only use the quick bake mode, which takes 2 hours to complete.  ---  --- Let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). You just push the reset or cancel button and start over, right? Nope, no such button exists. Then unplug the unit and plug it back in, right? Nope, the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages, so the unit remembers where it left off. Yes, but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes, and after 10 minutes it will forget, right? Nope, I tried this, too. The unit does indeed forget eventually, but it's more than 11 minutes. If you plug it back too early, the timer resets and you have to wait again. ---  --- To summarize, the hardware is excellent, and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber	pos
This is the best jak game in the series.  The handling of the wasteland vehicles is spectaculur.  The game is not easy which is good.  Graphics are good as well.  If you are a fan of ratchet and clank get this game.  Overall I give this game a perfect 10	pos
I'm a previous owner of Body Glove Cel Phone cases (a Moto V810). ---  --- I purchased this item from Amazon a few days ago for my 6255.  My Cel fits perfectly.

This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it.

I read the review saying Simple Start didn't have enough features and would lead to upgrading to get a usable version. Despite the warning, I thought I could get away with Simple Start because I was buying the program for bookkeeping at a tiny church and would be putting few demands on the program.

I have a 06 Corvette and 05 Explorer and I use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes, they work well and seem safe and strong(you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure).With the Vette, the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage(If you are worried about it rubbing, you could use two 1x4's in front of the ramps for additional clearance). The ramps are about 6.25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me(250lbs)under the Vette. Nice product	pos

I developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  Never having acne before, this was devistating.  I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad's Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  I purchased the starter kit and I liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half, I was still experiencing bad breakouts.  I even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  I spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  Silly me, I was going to order more but I started reading reviews for my only alternative, Proactiv.  Now that stuff isn't any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review and I figured that it was worth a try.  I found it at my local Walreens for $19.  Let me tell you, I used Acne Free for 2, TWO, days and saw results that I had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  I can't say enough about it.  I'm thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  Goes to show, don't buy from T.V. 	neg
Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. It's heavy and very dense, very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. Heavy duty, takes dropped dumbbell punishment, and resists damage/cuts. Use a drywall T-Square as a guide, and put a new blade in a box cutter. Take several passes to cut it and take your time. It cuts straight and square for a professional look. I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym	pos
The table arrived within a few days and well packed. --- It was easy to put together, took me about 10 minutes.

good and comfortable controller (better than the N64 ones were).  It works much better than a 3rd party controller, such as madcatz.  If you plan to, or have played "super smash brothers melee"(great game) you will notice how much easier it is to pull-off moves with a nintendo brand controller. It is worth the extra money, no-matter what it says on the third party company's package (dont be fooled by a third party controllers extra button: the "M" button, it does nothing because a nintendo brand controller doesnt have one and developers design games according to nintendo brand controllers). I never use my cheap madcatz controller (madcatz controller often malfunctions as well), this one is much better, and black goes with everything.  My rule of thumb: Nintendo brand game accessories are more reliable, longer lasting, eye appealing and overall better than third party distributers. *please vote yes if I helped	pos
I subscribed to Details because I'm interested in the male psyche. I also like looking at the male celebrity pictures and the guy models on ads. Its not the most politically correct article on the planet, for one the last page is called "gay or...?" In which the writer tries to uncover if a certain type of person is gay or not, and no conclusion is actually ever given so I suppose its for the reader to decide.  ---  --- Its a very stereotypical part of the magazine, but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives. I also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews, in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. I don't agree with everything that is printed here, but certain articles have made me think and I've actually gotten a lot out of it. It helps me understand guys and I do agree with certain opinions. The mag leans toward the liberal and is unabashed in its attitude to do so. I like it a lot, it may  not be for everyone and that's fine.	pos
I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing "pad" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags	neg
I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router. ---  --- I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find. ---  --- I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting. ---  --- I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier.	neg

Do not buy this camera, I repeat do not buy this camera! Just read the reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Lucky I got this piece of junk for Christmas, so I didn't spend a dime on it. I opened the package BEFORE reading any reviews. Now I wish I've read the reviews before opening the box. I don't care what setting you use, I tried them all and I have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera. The lighting sucks, you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones. I really wanted this camera to work, it looks sweet but sadly it can't take pictures.	neg
Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  Besides the money, I mean.  There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.  But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published	neg
how many RPG's can this world make??  they're all the same.  open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly.  the combat IMHO is just really boring.  when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make.  if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves.  umm, how many times has this been done before?  if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now.  all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers.  it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up).  the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it. 	neg
THE BEST SET OF WIRELESS CONTROLLERS I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MY XBOX SYSTEM. THE CONTROLLERS ARE NICELY FITTED FOR COMFORTABLE USE AND DOES NOT CRAMP UP YOUR HANDS AFTER HOURS OF PLAY.

After 3 months use, I'm buying two more of these for my daughters. The unit is compact, very sturdy, virtually silent, and puts out plenty of mist even on the low setting. The small tank is light and easy to fill, even in a bathroom sink (many people really have to wrestle with those one gallon tanks) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or nights sleep.  ---  --- The key feature is that it is small and quiet. That means it can be near you on a desk top or night table. Having the mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will condense on cold windows (and cause mildew). It also means you can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top. If you want to use the high setting, put the unit on top of a book shelf, dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the mist to settle.  ---  --- This is small and light enough to take on the road to dry hotel rooms. One daughter wants one for her dorm room, which is overheated. The unit is easily moved from bedroom to den or wherever you locate during the day. You would not find this convenient with large (gallon) humidifiers.  ---  --- This unit is also inexpensive, at around $30 which is half the cost of many larger models (so you can get two). After using several evaporative humidifiers, I love not spending $6 - $9 a month for paper replacement wicks.  ---  --- Overall, I am delighted with the unit. The only criticsm is the blue LED is too bright in a dark room. This is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive tape over it. The light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night. It also lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the chamber.  ---  --- Highly recommended.	pos

If I could give this product over five stars, I would!  I get eczema on my eyelid and went through tons of products trying to find something to soothe it when I finally got this product in one of the starter kits Burt's Bees makes and I was hooked.

I have also noticed a decrease in the dark circles I always have when I use the royal jelly cream, though that could just be relief from no more eczema problems	pos

There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips). By the time you get to the end it's difficult to recall anything from the magazine; it's that shallow. ---  --- Occasionally there's a good recipe, but that's about it	neg
Looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads "Panasonic", not "Lumix". Fits the camera perfectly.

I thought the first Ice Age was great.  This one is good, not great.

I've been using System Mechanic 6 Professional, for about a month. I'd have to say that the overall performance of Windows XP has improved greatly since installation. Upon starting System Mechanic, a general report is given on the overall health of Windows. It fixes problems in the registry, defragments the hard-drives/ram, and boosts internet performance. All of this is done is done in a short period of time (under an hour). ---  --- I've also read all the negative reviews on Amazon. I'm not going to dispute any of them, since each user has his/her own experiences using the product. All I can say, is that I'm glad that the software worked for me. 	pos
I didn't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise; my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise, then it worked just fine.

This is a quite good item.  I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye.  It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker, but of the same style) much easier.  My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic.  Also, it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle.  You can fill over it I suppose, but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle.  I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time, but that is a general issue with the bottles, not this lid.  But overall, a very useful purchase	pos
Why is it that Us Weekly can't get a copy to me weekly?  Sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue.  Then I'll receive three in one week.

I love Heinlein.  I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  I find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring.  Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  The "main" characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored	neg
Despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is NOT a computer crime novel. In fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. One positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc. are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some time abroad again	neg
Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works.  ---  --- I have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. I'm 27 now.  ---  --- After I graduated from the university and started working a real job, the stress went straight to my face (you all know what I am talking about). Unfortunately for me, I am allergic to benzyl peroxide and I have extremely sensitive skin. I also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and I have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?). ---  --- I was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. But, after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - I decided to give it a try. Hell, what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not I can always send it back. ---  --- I started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. I finally feel like my acne is under control. I recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years.  ---  --- The cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. The blemish serum is extremely drying, so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day, until your skin is ready. The day and night face creams are cool. The day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! That's why it works, because it is on your face until night time when you wash (I can even faintly smell the product). Then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream, yes not benzyl. Yeah, this cream is intense as well. So take it slow until your skin is ready.  ---  --- One thing that I do recommend is that if you wear make-up, use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. That's what I do and it works for me - so I will share it with you. ---  --- Another thing I do is I will take a little bit of the hope is not enough SPF moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. Remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne. ---  --- Well that's about it. I hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life.  ---  --- Take care, --- M. Rodriguez --- Surprise, AZ ---  ---  	pos
We bought this watch for my 8-year old-- who loves it.  We deliberately wanted him to develop his time-telling skills (i.e., no digital watches please!), and have a "cool" watch, too.  The velcro strap, the second hand, water-resistant qualities ("I can wear it in the shower, Mom!"), and the indiglo face (very cool in movie theaters) made this a great buy.	pos
I started with the second volume, The Mammoth Book of More Historical Whodunnits, and enjoyed it so much that I went out and got a copy of this one as well.

Very dangerous!  My daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike.  The handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over.  There is only one good thing about it.

About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films	neg
This carrier worked well on our Honda Pilot.  It kept several large suitcases dry.  We used several large bungee cords to secure it.  The only problem was that it made noise but we taped them down.  The fabric kept them very well protected.  I would recommend it for anyone needing the extra space in their car	pos

I enjoyed this magazine as a kid, but then, I also loved Electric Company.  Looking at both now, they seem dated and tedious, but perhaps our children need something that moves at a slower pace than everything seems to do now. Neither of my children (5 & 7) enjoyed Highlights at first, but after getting a subscription from their grandmother, they have discovered the joy of curling up in a quiet corner and figuring out the puzzles and stories for themselves.  It's a magazine with a style and format that encourages reflection and absorption, rather than a voracious grab and go version of reading, that I believe will give a child a better foundation.

I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem	neg

I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.   ---  --- I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.   ---  --- Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i	neg

I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again	neg
I'm a great fan of Earl Grey tea and have enjoyed starting my morning with a cup o' the grand stuff for nearly fifteen years. As it happens I am in very good company in this practice along with the likes of Captain Picard and the eponymous Earl Charles Grey himself. Earl Grey is one of the more popular and well-known kinds of tea in the world and deservedly so. Despite general belief, Earl Grey is not a tea varietal at all, but simply ordinary black tea infused with bergamot, a citrus flavor from the rind of the fruit. Try your cup with a few drops of fresh lemon juice for some occasional, yet delicious, variety. It is also pretty neat to watch the lemon juice lighten the tea from dark brown to yellow as the citric acid reacts with the blend! ---  --- The Tazo version of Earl Grey is one of the best I have ever tasted. Perfectly balanced, light, aromatic.....it's the perfect start to a morning	pos

Purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend who uses this product, he was excited to receive this.  I was excited that I was able to purchase it at a considerable savings over department store prices.  This same product in a smaller size retails for $45-$55 locally and I was able to purchase him a larger bottle for less than $30.

I purchased this outdoor atomic clock three months ago and hung it out by our backyard pool.  It is sheltered a bit by the roof overhang, but it still gets some blowing wind and rain.  So far, the clock has kept perfect atomic time.  The temperature indicator is a bit small, so we really can't see that feature from the pool deck, but the hands on the clock are easy to read.  This clock serves our purpose perfectly.  I have read reviews that say outdoor clocks like this aren't really suited for the weather, but I have no complaints, and it's been 90 days of crazy Florida weather.  We got the clock with free shipping, so the price was right, too.  Great clock, great deal	pos

This OS is not for any ordinary user.  If you know nothing about drivers, peripherals, etc, then don't get this OS.  Lots of incompatability issues.  I thought this OS would make my gaming experience better, apparently it needs lots of work.  Can't play CS:S, Day of Defeat, Lord of the rings Online, etc.  BF2142 and some other games play slower in Vista compared to XP.  I hardly write reviews, but I just want everyone to know that this OS suxs!  Stay with XP Pro SP2.  Games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on XP.  It isn't worth getting right now, wait a year or two until it gets worked out.  Feels like BETA, which it shouldn't.  Microsoft, you get a F- for your new OS.  You fail.  Nice try	neg
we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer. It's simply not woth anything.  The little file is a good idea, but too tiny to actually work.

I recently purchased an Orgeon Scientific JM889NA-S Jumbo Atomic Wall Clock with Indoor Temperature and have been delighted with it in every way. My main concern before it arrived was the brightness of the display. Well this unit far exceeds my expectations ... it is very bright and is visible from a great distance. A lot of LCD displays that I have seen on clocks, etc have been very dim and to me, very unsuitable. ---  --- Another feature that this unit has is automatic time updates and I found that it not only works, but works in my work place office. My office is an interior office (ie not located near any windows) and it is able to pickup the time signal through our building walls. This is amazing!! ---  --- I have also found the JM889NA-S to be very attractive looking and very well designed. ---  --- Five cheers for Oregon Scientific	pos

Rice Bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. After just one to two uses, you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. Weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. The smoothness, clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use.  ---  --- If you have oily or combination skin, you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers.  ---  --- The Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. The ingredients include: Rice Germ Oil, Rice Bran, Coconut Oil, Seaweed, Aloe Algae, Ginkgo Biloba, Matricaria, Yeast, Perilla Ocymoides, Honey, Lithospermum and Fountain Water. ---  --- The Moisture Cream goes a long way. The main oils are Rice Germ Oil, Jojoba Oil and Olive Oil. Vitamin E, Rice Bran and Aloe make this a skin-healing treat. ---  --- Other products to fall in love with:  ---  --- Cleansing Powder - Packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water.  ---  --- Makeup Remover - A fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. Based on olive oil.  ---  --- UV Cream - Slightly tinted and waterproof, this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. Could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look.  ---  --- Hair Shampoo & Conditioner - Thickens fine hair instantly. Removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious.  ---  --- Essence - This is a product that is magical. It can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review	pos
If you liked Vice City, you'll love San Andreas. With more missions, car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over, what could be better? ---  --- The games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while, however, the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash.  ---  --- As a note, I had NO problems running this game with pretty much all options on high. I run a Dell 8300 3.0 HT, 1 GB ram, Radeon 9700 PRO and it flies! ---  --- Strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	pos

I love soups and stews and I am in LOVE with this Seafood Chowder.  It's the absolute best flavor and chock full of a variety of seafood.  The taste is great!!  I've tried many many chowders and this ranks the highest of any I have ever eaten....even Legal Seafood's or Wolfgang Puck's or several local Massachsetts seaside restaurants.  And it's all natural with no artificial ingredients.  I recommend this to everyone who loves seafood and chowders.  Of all the Baxter Soups and Chowders, this is really the only one I recommend everyone try.  I repeat...it's great!!  It is a bit high in salt though.....~1,400 mg/can but if this is the only salty food eaten all day...it's OK.  Try it....it's heavenly!	pos

Don't buy this camera!!!  Prone to "Memory Error" & E18 errors after warranty is up.  Cost min $150 plus shipping to fix. ---  --- This camera was great until 23 months went by then I started mysteriously losing pictures due to file format errors.  I switched memory cards and it happened again.  Then the "memory error" displayed after a month or so of losing pictures.  Now it doesn't work at all.  I called canon to see what type of service could be provided and if they would fix what appears to be a factory defect since so many people have reported this problem.  Minimum cost is $150 or I could upgrade to a refurb S500 for $199 w/6 month warranty.  They have to be kidding, $250 get me a new one.  For what appears to be common problem I was expecting more from canon.  Guess I won't be buying another canon. ---  --- Google this "Canon "Memory Error" E18" and see for yourself that Canon cameras have problems.	neg
This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period	pos

I've never been a fan of propane stoves. They always seemed flimsy, made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now. After two weeks of RV-ing, the Fold 'N Go has become a welcome addition to our set up.  ---  --- It is very sturdy and seems extremely well made. The wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large, heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time. Few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots. And it seems very stable when set on a table. ---  --- And because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case, even though it handles such large tasks, it's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space. It also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that's it. You're ready to cook.  ---  --- And after you're done, clean up is a snap. Unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty, spattered grease, this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off, wipe off underneath, flip the pot supports over to store inside and then Fold 'N Go! ---  --- It's great to get cooking moved outside the RV - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam. And because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other, we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future. ---  --- 	pos

There are more expensive units out there and they might be appropriate for you if you need more information.  But this one is perfect for what I need. ---  --- I had "Check Engine" lights on both my 2000 Accord and 2005 Camry.  I wanted to find out what the problems were so I could decide if it was something that needed immediate attention and to find out if it was something I could fix myself. ---  --- It found the problems on both cars within a couple of minutes and reset the errors.  The Honda had a "proprietary" error so I installed the database software (extremely easy to install) and looked it up (extremely easy to use). ---  --- Turns out both cars had non-critical problems and I could just reset the errors.  This would have cost me $150 at my car maintenance shop. ---  --- This device also functions as a pollution control system diagnostic tool.  I haven't tried that yet but it will be interesting to see how that works. ---  --- I would highly recommend this for the "casual" user.  Pros would probably need something that does more stuff, but this will be extremely useful for shade-tree mechanics	pos

A well-crafted comprehensive look at the role of Islam in Turkey. The book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that Turkey has experienced since the 1980s.

After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker. ---    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead. ---   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. --- In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together! ---   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.  ---  --- After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter! ---   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one. ---   --- We never get closure on Lyra's parents. --- We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. --- We never see Will reunited with his mother. --- We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. --- Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. --- The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. --- The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. --- Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa. ---  --- Another reader pointed out: --- " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly." ---  ---  It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. --- This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.	neg
This humidifier is easy to refil and not a  big eye-sore even in small rooms.  Also, stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers.  Would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours.  Which I guess it's good that it's easy to refil.  The price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price.  Perhaps you pay for the convient size.   --- Overall, I really do like this humidifer and is the only one I like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size.   ---  	pos

For those who may be new to Suunto, they are wrist-top computers designed and manufactured in Finland and are in use all over the world by Hikers, Bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds.  What makes the X-Lander stand out are at first glance, obviously its sheer size.  Let there be NO illusions, the X-Lander is a mighty big watch.  Despite its size, it doesn't FEEL as big as it looks, though.  The aluminum case is VERY light and quite comfortable, too.  The next thing you notice would be the HUGE amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device. ---  --- #1. An accurate altimeter.  This is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker.  One thing you MUST be ready to do is remember to adjust it DAILY.  Find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip, and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped (which you can do with the internal recording function) and properly adjust it before setting out the next day.  This is NOT a flaw, every single altimeter watch I am aware of is exactly the same. ---  --- #2. Barometer.  I found it correct at least 75% of the time, which is more than I can say for the local TV Weatherman.  This includes a thermometer as well, which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat. ---  --- #3. Digital Compass.  This is truly one amazing feature, by the way.  Once you calibrate it (which you may need to do weekly) you will NEVER be lost -- especially if you know how to use a map. ---  --- #4. It tells pretty accurate time, too believe it or not.  It also comes with an alarm, a countdown AND a stopwatch.  Suddenly its size now makes sense, huh?   ---  --- I happen to LIKE big watches.  I don't exactly know why, but I just do.  IF I were to have ANY complaint whatsoever, the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive Vector: A tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading.  The reason why may have to do with the fact that the X-Lander is mineral crystal and the Vector is plastic, but either way, it'd be nice to have.  I am VERY impressed with just about everything associated with Suunto and their fantastic line of what they call, Wristop Computers.  IF size really DOES matter to you, well you may wish to go with the Observer or maybe the X6HR (which does everything the X-Lander and Observer can do PLUS it has a built-in heart-rate-monitor) both are smaller than the X-Lander, Vector, Yachtsman and many other Suunto models yet still offers a LOT -- but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price.  Factor all that into your purchase plans and once again, if at ALL possible, do NOT buy until you have the chance to see some of these (or any) models IN PERSON.  That will make a HUGE difference in how happy your purchase will end up being...and good luck! 	pos
My son is 11 and loved this.  He was very proud when he built it by himself.  It is very detailed and has movable parts so that you can also play with it (gently of course).  This is the type of piece that is great all by itself without getting all the other pieces in the series.  It is also a classic piece in that it doesn't have a cartoon or charter theme	pos
I know a lot of people liked this book, but I felt like it put too much pressure on me to pack on the pounds.  I didn't realise so much of the book was focused on diet.  It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be.  Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight.  The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!  I decided to stop reading the book, and so far, just going by what my gut says about what to eat and when, I've managed to put on 20 pounds.  My twins are measuring perfectly and are very healthy. ---  --- This book isn't horrible, but I would check it out of a library or borrow it or buy it used, don't spend the $ on a new one... and be prepared to put it down if it doesn't sound right to you	neg
Bought one of these to jump start my 3.6 litre 911. It doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged. Complete waste of time, maybe it will start a lawn mower.	neg

I also bought this magazine sight-unseen and I wish I hadn't.  For re-decorating purposes, I found this magazine to be not useful at all.  The homes and gardens are pretty, but what they feature (furniture, wall and window coverings) just would not go with the middle-class home...way too opulent.  I was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from XYZ Antique store in New York.  Also, I found this magazine text-heavy.  All in all, an OK magazine for a professional decorater maybe, but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate	neg
I purchased these but had to return them.  while the molded strap is adjustable, it only opens up approx. 1".  The magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5" or larger around - at the eyebrows, forget it, these will not fit you	neg
The game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults.  This makes it great game for the whole family to play together.   The images from the "I Spy" book illustrations are bright and  creative.  They don't match exactly- for instance, there might be two  images of cats, but borrowed from different photographs in the I Spy books.   So there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up.  This is a much  more attractive memory game than most, and would make an ideal gift for a  child or family	pos
this magazine is the best one out there. if your a hardcore ps2 gamer, get this for a year or two. ive gotten this since it was still psone magazine and i have never seen one bad issue. they give you reviews that are %97.9 of the time helpful. you know the're serious 'cause they write down entire levels! PLUS THEY GOT SWIMSUIT ISSUES! a must for the gamer. --- -XESX	pos
Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&M pink & black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	pos

This is a single player game.  Set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic.  The puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated.  By the end, the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before.  Both kids love it- ages 4 and 9.  We helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking "Whoes in that cars way?" Then "whoes in the trucks way?" until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards	pos
I purchased Crazy Croc even after reading all the bad reviews, but my son really wanted it so I bought it for him for Christmas anyway.  It was the worst gift i've ever bought....please don't even waste your money....trust me, check the reviews first, now that's worth it...	neg
My just turned 6 year old can figure out 70% of the logic needed in this game, he can't do a VERY few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy I had to finally defeat for him.  BUT, he really likes this game, he "gets" the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters.  It has a tad more "killing" of stuff than I care for but what doesn't these days. He likes being able to be different characters, his favorite is Puss n Boots! ---  --- As a grown up I enjoyed it as well, especially the humor	pos
I stumbled on these in Whole Foods and decided to buy a couple of packages.  I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I have eaten them with.  Maybe it's because I am a heck of a cook! :-) This are not pasta they ARE tofu. If you are looking for something to be negative and skeptical about YOU WILL FIND IT.  I could eat these noodles with home made spaghetti sauce every single day!  Go ahead, try them for yourself...If you have an open mind, you will NOT be disappointed!  Also, the shipping should not be a bad reflection on the quality/taste of the product it's self. This stuff is GREAT...look for them in a store near you so you won't have to worry about the shipping... 	pos

An ex-officer in the Argentinean military confesses how political prisoners were murdered. I can't write "highly recommended" about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event.

I loved the idea of the electric heating. The "ease" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent "rod" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips. ---  --- It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at. ---  --- I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on "stank". ---  --- Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too "scientific"	neg
I buy these in bulk, and have done since my darling sister in law gifted me with a boxful of Lush goodies some years back.   ---  --- I have terrible circulation.  I get cold and stay that way.  From time to time I'm also an insomniac.  The Wiccy Massage Bar has a cure for both.  The cinnamon leaf is very warming on the skin and the Aduki beans seem to help this warmth penetrate. (They also fall all over the floor if you're not careful...but you wont care..the bar is THAT good). The oil is thick and lovely - but be careful about rubbing up against anything it may stain.  This is one of the reasons I only ever use it before bedtime.  Who cares if it messes up the Cartman Flannel Pajama bottoms?   ---  --- Speaking of bedtime...I'm not sure what it is..whether it's the cinnamon or the other essential oils I can't name, but they have a very calming effect.  Much better than yucky smelling lavender.  Helps me get to sleep in no time flat.   ---  --- I rub it on the back of my neck and sometimes, even on the underside of my pillow case, for this soft comfy shut eye	pos
Good things: (1) Baby loves watching the hanging toys. (2) The nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant. ---  --- Bad things: (1) VERY troublesome to assemble. The supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads. In the most critical support structure (the kickstand) I could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out. But I did get it together well enough to use. However, I considered returning it to the store during assembly. (2) The vibration feature broke after about 1 month of use. (3) Baby cannot reach the toys, even at 3 months of age, and we have a very tall baby. (4) Toys are very easily removed from their "holes" so that you can't really move the chair without the toys falling out. (5) The rocker has a very big "footprint". It takes up about half of the surface area of our four-seat kitchen table	neg

I can't get enough of Okami! I've beaten it and am started on a second play-though. Any action-RPG game fan has to at least try this game! The title basically says it all. It is a typically Japanese play on words, since, depending on how you translate it, "Okami" can mean either "wolf" or "king of the gods". For those people to whom that is not enough information to really understand the game, here are the basics: ---  --- 100 years before the game's beginning, a huge 8-headed dragon monster called the Orochi menaced the small village of Kamiki. After suffering Orochi's tyranny for years, the village's champion, Nagi, and a white wolf the village dubbed Shiranui, defeated the Orochi. Shiranui died from his wounds after the fight, and the village built a shrine for him. Peace reigned for 100 years, until the evil suddenly and mysteriously reappeared... ---  --- You control Shiranui reborn in a quest to save the land from the evil. You travel all over the land of Nippon (which is Japanese for "Japan"; how original) fighting monsters, helping people, and healing nature of the curse of evil. The story is nothing new, and is both very linear and quite predictable. But it is very well done, mixing japanese mythology into a classic hero story, with a generous helping of humor to give it flavor. ---  --- The story has one major downside, though: it is told through cut scenes that contain bucket-loads of exposition. You will often find yourself button-mashing X desperately to try to speed things along, and that does not work very well because the important cut scenes don't let you speed up the dialogue. For instance, the very first cut scene that opens the game literally takes at least 15 minutes to get through before you can get to the action. Most of the rest are not nearly that long, but several of them do take a good 5 minutes at least. To say that it gets tedious is an understatement. ---  --- Still, the cell-shaded graphics largely make up for the tedious cut scenes. They are done in a very beautiful, yet simplistic style that evokes a traditional Japanese ink painting. Despite the simple style, though, the level of detail is outstanding. In fact, it is so detailed that there is the occasional spot of graphical slowdown. This game really pushes the hardware of the PS2 to its limits. ---  --- The music and sound are also fantastic. Most of the music evokes traditional Japanese art as much as the graphics do, while the sound effects range from wolf barks and footfalls to wind blowing gently through trees, and more. The mood is always set perfectly for whatever environment you're visiting. ---  --- Except, possibly, with the voices. Rather than real voices, people talk in a form of gibberish that sounds like someone trying to talk underwater. While it does not bother me personally, some people simply can not listen to these voice effects. Either you'll hate the voice noises with a passion, or you won't care at all. Either way, this is not a good point for the game. ---  --- The controls take a bit of getting used to, but when you have gotten used to them they become second nature. Unlike the "Legend of Zelda" games, there is no enemy lock-on during combat. Instead, you automatically target the closest monster(s) when you push the attack button. This simplifies combat without turning it into a button-mashing cake walk. It works perfectly...unless you get hit by the controller bug. ---  --- Yes, a *bug* in the game. Thankfully rare, as I only encountered it twice in 60+ hours of game play. Still, when it happens it is extremely annoying. During combat, while you're wailing away on a monster, the options-menu will suddenly open for no reason. Usually, the analog control on your controller will also go crazy, either just turning off or madly flickering on and off. Either case makes the game impossible to play, of course, since you control your in-game avatar with the left analog stick. The first case is easy to fix; just turn the analog control back on and exit the menu. In the second case, you can only fix it by literally unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in. ---  --- Far more common than the controller bug are the load times. They usually are not terrible, but it seems like a loading screen comes up at least every five minutes or so. Between these and the long cut-scenes, you might sometimes wonder if there is actually any game play included. ---  --- But there *is* game play, and it is a lot of fun. There is a great deal to keep you occupied, from the compelling story line to the many treasure hunts, races, puzzles, and mini-games. Between fighting to save the world, you can go fishing, feed animals, catch thieves, and a lot more. Plus, after you beat the game once it unlocks lots of extras, including image galleries and the sound track. All of that and the wonderful atmosphere definitely make this a game worth checking out. Rent it before you buy it, if possible, to make sure you can deal with the long cut scenes, numerous load times, and weird voice effects. But if you are a fan of action RPGs like "Legend of Zelda", you will definitely want to add Okami to your game library. ---  ---  --- Summary: ---  --- Pros: ---  --- - Great story --- - Great graphics --- - Great music/sound --- - Wonderful atmosphere --- - Lots of culture and mythology to give it flavor --- - Plentiful activities and mini-games --- - Unlockable extras after beating the game ---  --- Cons: ---  --- - Occasional graphic slowdown --- - Too much exposition --- - Tedious cut-scenes --- - Lots of load times --- - Rare controller bug ---  --- Neutral: ---  --- - Voice noises that you might or might not hate ---  ---  --- Over-all score: Five stars of fun-fun-fun!  But three stars over all because of the many problems	pos
I was given this as a gift, so thankfully I didn't waste my money on it.  This sterilizer is so messy and awkward, that I can not recommend it at all.  The metal pan started corroding after only a week.  Little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop.  All the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty, so I can't imagine how it could possibly clean.  Horrible product	neg
The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips.  I am a 5'6" 120 lb. small boned female.

I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now	neg
These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious.  --- These would make a great gift for a little girl as well.I particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as I suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear. Having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection. At the price of under 10 dollars I was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there, how are you.	pos
I wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this Timex design.  I was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person...clear face, leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some, good weight (not too heavy).  I have received a few compliments at work/co-workers were surprised at the value for the cost.  Overall, a solid Timex offering that you will enjoy if you're drawn to the style/image that appears here in the product details	pos
What a great movie.  And it's still believable after all these years even with the mainframe computer consoles and tape reels and camera monitors.  The panscan is very well executed and hardly noticeable or annoying.  The print that was used has stood up very well. ---  --- This is the movie that got me interested in programming computers when I first saw it.  Before there even was a Microsoft, I had dreams of one day building my very own super computer under a mountain somewhere.  The damn things can now fall deep inside your ear canal and lodge inside your brain if you're not careful. ---  --- I wish the movie had more story to it instead of just being a rather quick build-up to an even quicker ending.  But this is a movie I can watch over again and again.  Wow.  This isn't just any movie about a mainframe and its keypunch operator.  This one's the real McCoy	pos
I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item!  These are flimsy, thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter.  I'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad.  Fortunately there are other products that work better...if this was the only option, I might as well not have a sheet on at all.	neg
Graphically, this game is a work of art. The shiny surfaces, glowing lightsabers, and vibrant colors make this a winner. ---  --- As far as gameplay those, you can even forget the graphics! This gameplay is so good, you could play it with terrible graphics, and still have an aweseome time! ---  --- The score by John Williams is another highlight. The music enhances the tension, action, and drama of this game. ---  --- Overall, this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played	pos
My cannon died the day before my daughters birthday so I ran out and tried a bunch of cameras in the morning and bought one.  Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures.  I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair.  First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  When I pushed delete, the menu came up.  Even the mode selector wasn't working.  It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable.  I am done with this camera	neg

Okay, I gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it didn't play right.  But after viewing it without the technical problems, I would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter, a good addition to any collection.  Ancient muscle conditioning?  Not many dvd's out there on the subject.  I've edited my original review and it won't allow me to give it more stars, but I'd give it 4.  Sorry, Mr. Keen, if I cost you sales on this.  I commend you for putting this out	neg

I ordered this guitar for my 4 yr old grandson for Xmas after he became interested in my guitar.The company did a fantastic job and it was shipped and received in time for Xmas .The guitar was surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see in stores with fishing line strings..these were real steel strings with an extra string just in case.The only draw back so far has been in keeping the one of the  strings taunt. There is an adjustment screw in the back of each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it , it becomes loose..overall my grandson is completely amused with his "tar"and spends hours playing us  songs...thank	pos
I have purchased this product which I run on a Dual Core Processor under Windows XP Professional. Software is very unstable and crashes many times when I want to open a document from a URL. ScanSoft solution is that one should save the document in once PC and then open it up. This is of course unacceptable as this software should handle this and this is just a Band-Aid fix. --- Customer Service is the worst I have ever experienced and NUANCE/Scansoft need to greatly improve this. I have submitted on various occasions emails which I never ever receive a response. When talking to customer service they promise they would get back to you and so far have NEVER EVER done so!!!! Extremely unreliable service. I own many of their products and will NEVER EVER purchase another one of their products.	neg

this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an Atreyu Album. It dies today rip off the former bands style, but they are still a very good band.  In the over-crowded metalcore market of today, that is a rarity.  My only complaint, is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice (as heard on "The Radiance), but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music. still 5/5 material though. --- Favorite songs: "The Radiance," "Freak Gasoline Fight," "Our Disintigration," and :THe Caitliff Choir:Defeatism	pos
These pods work well with my Simplehuman coffee maker.  And I can get both an 8 oz. cup and an additional 5 ozs out of each pod.  Taste of the mocha cinnamon swirl is balanced and not too sweet.

I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service!  ---  --- This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.   ---  --- Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone	pos
I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good.  When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people.   I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.  The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox	neg
There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.   ---  --- With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful. ---  --- Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory.	neg
I just bought the SpeedBelt 2, deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me. So far, the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range. It fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle. For longer runs, I'd suggest the 4-bottle belt, but this one is great for the intermediate range. The belt fits comfortably and I didn't feel that it bounced around much at all. Recommended	pos
We purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky Sony DSC-P52, which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism. Naturally, only time will tell if this is any different, but in the meantime, here's what you need to know about this baby: ---  --- The Good: ---  --- 1) Size and weight - Fits almost comfortably in any pocket. Much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera I've owned, thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere. The size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting. ---  --- 2) Big LCD screen - You didn't need me to tell you this, right? Makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying, though sometimes it does not appear very clear, especially if the subject is not static. However, it is bright and rich in color. ---  --- 3) InfoLithium - This is Sony's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately, of course. If use is consistent, will provide you with a good idea. If you use one function then another then another, it tends to vary much more and is not as useful.  ---  --- 4) Integrated charger/USB station - A flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a USB hookup for downloading images and video into the computer. Minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger, though the bright white color is far from a match. ---  --- The Bad: ---  --- 1) Focusing problems - The camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it. I am not speaking about macros, but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small, near objects, such as coins, stamps, or text. Quick focus on objects farther away, though. ---  --- 2) Integrated Battery - I listed the InfoLithium as a positive, but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of AA batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice. I don't know if the battery is universal, but even if it is, it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement. ---  --- 3) Incompatible Memory Sticks - I will not complain about Sony's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard, but this camera uses the MemoryStick Duo, which is about 1/4 or so smaller than the "regular" MemoryStick. This means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous Sony digital cameras are pretty useless, as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards. ---  --- 4) Ineffective Flash - The flash is tiny, thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark. Within a few feet is okay, but farther subjects are not touched. ---  --- 5) 3x Optical Zoom - C'mon, this is 2005! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera. ---  --- 6) Slow Write Speed - There is a decent pause between pictures, meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate. You can certainly take pictures in bursts, but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick. Previewing the images is also slow. This is also disappointing, as it's not faster than my older P52. ---  --- 7) No Tripod Hookup - If you wish to use a tripod, you have to mount the camera on the plastic station, then connect the tripod to the plastic dock. This is far from ideal. ---  --- Well, there you have it. The negatives I listed may be insignificant for you, in which case this could be a great value for you. I am certainly happy with it, but I only wish Sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards, compatibilities, and dubious long-term quality	pos
One of the handles would not go in, the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when I would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction.

I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so. ---  --- Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not. ---  --- The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal. ---  --- AARO	neg

Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.

This monitor is pretty good.  It pick up my little one's little noises so I can get to her before she awakens.  It does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then 4 bars (which it is less then 4 bars most of the time as my house is long).  I do have high praise for the Fisher Price exchange service.  I had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn't use it until after the 30 day return allowance from Amazon was up.  Then after about 6 hours of use the monitor stopped working.  I was able to send it to Fisher-Price and they exchanged it in less then ten days! (no questions asked	pos
I bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier. This bag was ok to start and fit my britax (a feat in itself) BUT 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it BROKE. I would not buy it. I emailed the company and have yet to hear back	neg
I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand & Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.   ---  --- The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!   ---  --- Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.    ---  --- Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015! ---  --- - Kelly Garbato, Couch Potato Turned Fitness Fanati	pos

I found these gloves to be OK for short rides, but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful.  I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying.  Granted, these are Mtn Biking gloves, I don't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand.  I've tried to break them in, but after a dozen or more rides, they are still stiff	neg
The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product	neg
"Those who write well have more power and therefore have more control over their lives" (p.21).  If this is indeed true then Mem Fox is a very powerful woman!  In the midst of the phonics vs. whole language war being raged in the media, this book is a call for reading and writing teachers to examine their practices and strive for truly purposeful, artful teaching.  Fox's insights into her life as a writer, teacher and mother make this a truly inspiring and intensely challenging read.  I have always believed that to be an effective reading teacher, I must be a reader, able to share my passion for books with my students, but Mem Fox points out that unless I am a writer as well, I will be unable to know the difficulties, fears, hopes and needs of my students as writers.  I plan to thoughtfully explore the forms of writing I use, examine the writing process I go through and share my writing with my students on a more regular basis.  I am convinced that we will all grow from the experience!	pos
I purchased one and it lasted about 3 months; light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it.  Stinger replaced it under warranty-this time it lasted one month-same problem.  Stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1/2 months, again same problem.   --- Will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again-will buy a Flowtron which I had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2-3 years. 	neg

The controller range is less than 40 feet.  This car is much too fast for the short range.  It is very easy to outrun the contoller.  There is also a delay between control input and vehicle response.  All batteries were new and fully charged, checked with a meter.  A scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference.  The older Tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay.  Tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time	neg
Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.

Norton is now owned by the huge behemouth Digital River, who haven't a clue how to run support or customer service.  They are useless and anything with their grimy mits on it and we take a wide berth of it, wouldn't consider it.  Norton used to be top notch, now it is like pouring mollasses into your computer.  It interferes with everything.  Microsoft seems to have given up on them too, as Norton has not bothered to interface properly with Windows, a consequence being that it is also buggy and problematic.  I can only warn you ~ AVOID!!!  A bad bit of software and a company that hasn't any clue about what customer service is and doesn't look likely to change.

I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.

Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.

With the $70-million that was spent on the 2005 video-game-inspired film "Doom", you'd think that director Andrzej Bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly.  On second thought, given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of "shoot the mutants", it's pretty clear that Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment.  As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of ï¿½ber-soldiers lead by their "Sarge" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of "The Sphere".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (ï¿½ber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).  Why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in "Doom" defies logic. ---  --- To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy.  To anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of "Doom" on DVD, please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price.  That alone should tell you how "good" this film is	neg

Disappointing to see a man of Garbarek's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of MOR classical and soft world-beat markets. No one expects him to do a 'jazz' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses. Sadly,the evidence on this release is of an artist who's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion; theres nothing here he hasn't said better on his previous three or four outings. All is not lost though, and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of Garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or TV documentary about some beautiful natural environment. Forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and I guarantee you'll feel better for it	neg

I owned this set for about 2 and a half years before I finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers (I used it about 4-5 times per year). First off, the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place, it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head. Second, the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair. Third, the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use. I would roll up my hair (which would take like, 30 minutes because of the difficulty), and if I walked around the house to watch TV while I waited for my hair to set, the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room. I eventually lost like 6 clips from the "springing out" thing.  ---  --- The results of these rollers were great, though. I used them on my wedding  day and people loved it. Good results, but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers	neg
Nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is. The leather is nigh on invisible.  ---  --- It's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches, "case" would be stretching the definition somewhat	neg

Operations officer  ---   ---  During World War II the British Royal Air Force maintained nighttime bombing raids over Europe, while the United States Army Air Corps made large daylight raids. Since the Air Corps was clearly visible, their losses were heavy. American fighter cover did not have sufficient range to accompany the bombers, mainly the B-17 "Flying Fortresses," mainly from the Eighth Air Force, all the way to their German targets and back, which made them highly vulnerable. We lost 50,000 men in the air over Europe during that war. ---   ---  This is the fictional story of some of the men who fought that air war. ---   ---  Brig. Gen. K.C. 'Casey' Dennis (Clark Gable) is in command of a bomber division composed of several groups attempting to destroy the aircraft plants in Germany that are producing the Messerschmidt 262 jet fighter (the first operational jet fighter in the Second World War). The German jet was much faster and better armed than our P-51 'Mustang', P-47 'Thunderbolt', or P-38 'Lightning', our three best escort fighters, and was causing massive losses in the air. ---   ---  Dennis was obstructed by higher ranking generals who were worried about the reaction of the politicians and newsmen who were reporting the high losses to the American public. ---   ---  The course of the war was, indeed, in reality, affected by just such considerations, as it is in every war. This is a far better film, and reflected the reality of that particular war far better than I expected. I appreciated it. It was a well-acted, well motivated drama. ---   ---  Joseph (Joe) Pierre ---  author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance ---  and other books ---   --- 	pos

I always have a soft spot in my heart for film adaptations of Shakespeare.  They are always labors of love, often cribbed together by excellent actors and technicians working well-below scale just for the sheer thrill of working with the Bard.  Even the less-successful productions, such as Mel Gibson's turn as the Prince of Denmark or the recent update of "Love's Labours Lost" win my affection if not my undying devotion.   ---  --- But I had a special place in my heart for a few Shakespearean adaptations, such as Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V" and "Much Ado About Nothing," Ian McKellan's "Richard III," and even Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo + Juliet."  These were bravura, pell-mell, energetic films that made the Bard accessible and personal to me in a way that I couldn't get any other way.  I had thought that it would be a long time until another film jumped into that pantheon. ---  --- Michael Radford's "The Merchant of Venice" has made the list.  A lush take on one of Shakespeare's "problem plays," "The Merchant of Venice" features a reasonably-well-cut two-hour version of Shakespeare's original play, a stellar cast, and a sumptuous visual feast of Venetian delights.  And, perhaps most surprisingly, Al Pacino does not overwhelm the entire production by either chewing the scenery a la "Scent of a Woman" or by his sheer star wattage.  Indeed, in a cast that also features Joseph Fiennes and Jeremy Irons, it is a newcomer, the ravishing Lynn Collins as Portia, who nearly steals the show.  Radiating intelligence, wit, humor, and burning sexuality, Collins is a revelation and worth the price of admission on her own. ---  --- This "Merchant" also has the courage to leave no doubts as to the relationship between Bassanio (Fiennes) and his lover/patron, Antonio (Irons).  This is a mature, focused, respectful production that honors both its audience and the original source material.  Check it out	pos

I have subscribed to the all of the big car magazines for years, I am glad I stumbled upon Sports Car International in Australia of all places.  The articles are all well written and devoid of the mindless blather you find in most of the other rags.

I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision.

I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too.  ---  --- This has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery. My pictures have always turned out beautifully, with wonderful color and crispness. I have discovered that the "automatic" lighting feature is not always the most ideal, but you can re-program just about anything on this camera.   ---  --- It's really quite a good camera, and given its price these days with the newer generations out there, it's a steal	pos

 ---  --- Frazee's comical "Guide for Babies of All Ages" has a subconscious message behind the humor, meanwhile encouraging those first few steps that will open up a universe of new experiences, baby leaving the shelter of the familiar for the unknown. The roly-poly baby illustrated is tiny compared to everything around him, objects taller than him, but once he pulls himself up and begins that first, tentative journey, it is impossible to stop. Of course, there are a few cautions along the way, "be careful of things that are wobbly; stay away from fragile stuff". There are the usual setbacks, too-much too-soon and a tumble to the floor, followed by a howl and the effort to being again. Cleverly worded and cheerfully illustrated, this tongue-in-cheek guide is a delight, offering more food for thought than is first apparent. Luan Gaines/ 2006.	pos

I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed	neg

Taste - last but not least, too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard, but this cereal is so good I can eat it right out of the bag like a snack.   ---  --- This cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix.  The other ingredients are Kashi's 7 Whole Grain Puffs, dried cranberries, pecans, and flax seed. With Heritage & Kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast: ---  --- 1.   Spelt --- 2.   Quinoa --- 3.   Kamut --- 4.   Millet --- 5.   Buckwheat --- 6.   Triticale --- 7.   Rye --- 8.   Red Winter Wheat --- 9.   Barley --- 10. Oats --- 11. Brown Rice --- 12. Sesame Seeds ---  --- Then I add the following to the bowl: --- 13. Flax Seeds - about a tablespoon --- 14. Pecans - about 2 tablespoons --- 15. Dried Cranberries - about 2 tablespoons ---  --- Then if you really want to go full-on healthy try Better Than Milk Original Flavor Vegan Soy Beverage, the best soy milk out there...see my review of it.	pos
I used to love this game, but there are so many better games out there, plus this game is overated, with a not so good storyline, and nerdy weapons, it's just not good	neg
We purchased Storkcraft's Rochester Stages Crib in Natural, Aspen Changing table, 5 Drawer Dresser, 3 Drawer Dresser, 2 side units (left and right) and a hutch. Every single piece of furniture that we've gotten from Storkcraft is damaged in some way ~ nicks and scratches and paint on a lot of the pieces. On the side panel of the 5 drawer dresser the piece is completely cracked. It's obvious that Storkcraft has no quality control. We're in the process of deciding whether or not we're going to return all of the furniture or just get replacement parts and/or a new unit. All I'm going to say is don't waste your time on purchasing Storkcraft furniture	neg
My sister who has 4 kids insisted I buy this and boy was she right!  Those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet.  First of all, the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that's a pain to tie on and off.  Especially when you get it on there just right.  Then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners.  Did I mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion?  Ugh, I don't think so. ---  --- I'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have  my daughter sit on a soaking sheet (this pad wicks away the moisutre) and have to go through so much trouble to change it. ---  --- As far as the "imprint" on her face, I haven't noticed any and she hasn't been bothered	pos
I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.	neg
I agree fully with "A music fan" above ... this and David's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work. I love most of Talking Heads music but don't rate Remain in Light highly like most fans do	neg
I already have a single jogging stroller (not a BOB) and have been happy with it. We are in the process of adopting our second child, which we had less than 24 hours notice about, so a lot of money is going to legal costs, baby stuff, and my time off of work, and as a result I was concerned about spending this much on a stroller, but is was worth every cent. With the BOB Duallie, I am ecstatic, overjoyed, delighted, thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out.  ---  --- For my first trip out, I put my 2 year old and 11 week old in and went for a six mile walk. The trip was so smooth, both kids slept for most of the time. The seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat, no problems with his head bobbing around (pardon the pun). The shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride, which transits to less work for my arms. I didn't realize how much effort went into the other stroller, pushing it and turning it. The smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster, a plus when trying to lose weight. ---  --- The stroller can turn in circles on itself, allowing for extremely sharp turns. Very nice, especially when inside a small store, like Starbucks. The windows up top are well placed enough that I can actually see my kid's face, not just their little bodies. The straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller I've used. There is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid's shoulders. The straps at the waist don't come out of the sides, (this is kinda hard to explain) the strap is attached in the center of the seat, and the sides come around the child, more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit. Even my 70 year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller.  ---  --- As for the Mesa Orange, it is more like a burnt orange, with brown trim and I am very glad I got it! It is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos. Be sure to get the tray, I forgot to order it with the stroller. The storage is a little shallow, but being double wide, there is still plenty of room for stuff.	pos
Wow! This is an excellent deck that lets you automatically get the Harpie Lady Cards, and as well as a monster card based on one of the characters from Legend Of The Mystical Ninja	pos
This unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part. The handheld part is mostly made of plastic. So, it's pleasantly light to hold, much lighter than my Wahl homecare thing. ---  --- The supplied guard things (that you swap to change length, etc.; IIRC they range from 1/8" to 1") have a curve on the bottom so it's easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them. This also makes things more pleasant. ---  --- Don't believe the no-mess story, though. It really does catch most of the hair, so it's certainly worthwhile, and it's easy to empty the hair trap, but I still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards. It doesn't catch it all	pos
All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also	pos
Purchased this software because I got a deal with a special price break.  I have a very small business, so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly.   ---  --- The set up took a lot longer than I had anticipated. --- The customer service was no help - couldn't answer my questions.  I ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right - another day wasted. ---  --- I've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since I've spent the money, but I'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime.  If this is "Quick Books,"  I need to find "Lightning Fast" Books somewhere	neg
I like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper, so I bought Tushies.  When my baby was newborn, they seemed to work ok, maybe because she didn't put out that much.  She is now three months old.  I practice attachment parenting so I know exactly when she has a bowel movement.  The past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly.  She was sitting on my lap, she had a bowel movement, five seconds later I got up to change her, the feces was all over my pants.  This has happened several times.  The concept of the diaper is great, but the diaper needs some work around the legs	neg
Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  Talk about crazy! 	neg
Quick shipping/ but poor packaging. There was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main SCREW and BOLTS pagackages were already open (lucky i found all) Bad packaging BUT EXCELLENT bench. It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in. Great multi-function product. You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition. Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow (no problems yet) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping (another 155 value) It was REALLY worth it. I say to anyone who likes it, its worth it. Just get it. Wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass	pos
This review is not about the toy, but about the service you can expect to receive from Amazon.com.  If you are buying this as a gift, only do so if you have months to wait, even if the item is listed as available.  Amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items, and then days later, inform you of a delay in shipping, and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery.  Despite the site's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered in 3-5 days.  Mind you, they're sending it via UPS or American Home.... --- Honestly, there are other retailers out there who are more reliable than Amazon.com and I strongly recommend using them - unless you're okay disappointing the little girl in your life.  I know I hate having to tell my neice that the gift I promised her still won't be there - even though her birthday has passed, by almost a week at this poin	pos
I started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow's milk that well. This product is great, has equal or more nutrition than cow's milk, has a good flavor, just slightly different than cow's milk,is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go, I don't have to worry about it spoiling I just mix and give it to my daughter	pos
This one was really boring.  Only buy this if you are trying to collect all the Scooby DVDs or if you have a very young child.  Very young children might find this mildly entertaining.  This is not a movie for older kids/teenagers/adults who are fans of Scooby Doo.  I loved Scooby Doo: Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyberchase, and Legend of the Vampire.  If you want to get a good Scooby Doo DVD get those instead.  Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was a huge disappointment too, but this was actually even worse. 	neg
I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38. 	pos
I've been wanting this for a while now, and I finally bought it.  It looks amazing in my kitchen - modern and classic, all at the same time - and the awesome smell as I was taking it out of the package - it made me want to cook dinner!  This is a great gift for anyone	pos
I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came.  I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however.  With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste.  Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it. ---  --- I really like the glass tea pot.  It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste. ---  --- I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.  On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint. ---  --- After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good.  Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is. ---  --- The bamboo box is quite charming	neg
If you're looking here you're obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore YOU NEED TO OWN THIS. Jim Hardy has figured it out.   ---  --- Forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is:  --- - take the club to inside and up on the backswing,  --- - keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open, --- - and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you (some might say "stuck"), while simultaneously "coming over the top" to get the club out in front of your body,  --- - and swing well to your left to complete the through swing (i.e. never "down the line.")   ---  --- Yes, this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you've ever heard.  But then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities?  In most cases if one is being honest the answer is "no." So it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it's time to give Hardy's "Plane Truth" a try.  ---  --- In addition to the video series which is amazing, I would also recommend both of Hardy's books as essential material. You want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills, you're more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you	pos
they got the texture and the level of sweetness just right.  These were fabulous if a tad bit expensive.  For a special treat I would buy these again	pos
On the basis of the first review here, I ordered this bike and couldn't be happier with it.  This is the first piece of exercise equipment I've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up. I use it every day	pos
Dean & Deluca's Basil can add delicious aromas to your crockpot cooking adventures. It is also perfect to add to a pot of steaming vegetables or to sprinkle on fish wrapped in puff pastry. The minute you open a tin of the Dean & Deluca Basil, you can sense the high-quality of the product and the aroma swirls into the air making you eager to try many of their herb and spice products.  ---  --- I especially love using this when making a homemade stock in my crockpot/slow cooker. It enhances soups, vegetables and just about anything you sprinkle it on that is savory. This can also be used in salad dressings and is especially delicious used over pasta, if you ever run out of fresh basil in the winter.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 	pos
Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed.  I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several  years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professional-by-day \ GadgetFreak-by-night guy. ---  --- If you don't read anything else in my review please understand this: --- 1)  This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump. --- 2)  If you are NOT in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data), you have no business with this phone. ---  --- This is a productiviy enhancer, it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day, this phone does the trick. ---  --- The battery life isn't that bad as I have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day. ---  --- Screen is bright. --- The WiFi feature works beautifully. --- The 3G network is amazingly fast. --- Works flawlessly with my Exchange 2003 server.  (Active Sync is so easy to setup, a noob could do it.) ---  --- The only reason reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail	pos
This tea is great with a little sugar or honey. It is the kind of tea to have on a cold snowy winter day.

Installed quickly, great image quality, but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot. I was told by others and ATI forums that the 1650 pro with ATI stock heat sink is KNOWN for its problems. Do not buy 1650 Pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card.  --- Also note, this may be an unrelated issue, after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced. Cannot tell if related to video card or not yet.   --- If you are wanting an ATI stock card, there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the AGP 1800 & 1900 series cards.	neg
Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image.  ---  --- Photographers often state the protective abilities of a hood as a reason to have one. This hood being a solid petal shaped offers limited protection from keeping moisture and wind blown debris off the from lens element. When in place, the hood can protect the lens from impacting solid objects. Being shallow and petal shaped, this type of protection is also limited. Even if the protection is limited, replacing a damaged hood is usually cheaper than repairing the lens and easier to replace.  ---  --- This hood is manufactured for the Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS EF and normally is not included with the lens when sold new.  Amazon often suggests purchasing one with your lens, and is worth considering.  ---  --- Since the hood is wider than the lens; it can easily be stored attached in a reverse position. This doesn't add to the length of the lens, but does make it wider by about an inch. An inch may not seem like a lot, but in a tightly packed camera bag, it is huge. This lens itself isn't unusually wide so the extra inch may not be a problem.  ---  --- While the protective benefits exist, they are secondary and limited. I find the impact the hood has on my image quality to be the more convincing reason to use a hood.  Considering the impact on image quality and the low cost as compared to my other camera equipment (except for a lens case), purchasing a hood is money well spent. ---  --- PROS:  --- Improves contrast and image quality  --- Reduces lens flare problems  --- Offers limited protection to the lens  ---  --- CONS:  --- Takes up more space in your camera bag to store with the lens	pos
I purchased this updated version 1/5/07.  It does not print correctly, and technical support assured me that the developer is "working on the problem" and a "fix" is soon to come.  This is March 1, and no update is available yet.  This program is UN-USABLE and I am very unhappy and would not recommend "as is" to anyone.  I have the 2005 edition and was very pleased with it.  This is a large embarrassment to the Hallmark company	neg
I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!	pos
I was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles. Unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat. And it took me all morning to get it put together. The holes for the straps to go into were so small I had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well. The screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short, and the washers needed to be pried together. Finally I was nearing the final steps, when lo and behold, I was missing a piece.  I call customer support, which is at Bell, not Fisher Price or Mattel. I was on hold for 20 minutes before I was able to speak to anyone.  Then when I spoke to the representative, she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes. This happened twice. Their solution to my missing piece? Use a zip tie, "We don't ship that piece separately."   ---  --- Excuse me? You make a mistake, you fix it. Regardless of whether or not "the piece is shipped separately. Ridiculous. And at the end of the conversation, there was no apology offered, no attempt to make the situation right. Ugh. ---  --- So now, I have nothing to show for my morning of effort. ---  --- Also, I attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter. I sat her in the seat, and she BARELY fits. She is two years old, barely weighs 23 pounds, and is tiny. I have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat. I had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years. That would NOT happen with this seat. ---  --- So, it is going back to the store, and I am buying a Kettler Flipper, or a Bobike Maxi, or a Topeak.  I will steer clear of Bell products in the future! ---  --- Oh, and to top it all off, the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging!! Worthless. ---  --- Save your time and your money, avoid this seat at all costs	neg
I bought this product from a nearby retailer. The packaging is deceptive. The Photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. The battery is $35.00 with shipping, and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. This frame has no on-board memory, so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. This is an additional expense. After purchasing the Photoframe I discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. I took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before I found one which had an unbroken frame. I took that Photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. I then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). With the retailer's very helpful clerks I tested three more PhotoCo Photoframe devices, none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). I returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device, then by email I requested a refund for the price of the battery. Photoco replied that if I sent them the battery they would refund its price. I mailed the battery on May 6,and then inquired about my refund on May 14. PhotoCo replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. On 3/17 I sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. PhotoCo said that my credit had been processed but that I might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. I still have not received my credit for the battery. If you want to avoid a headach, avoid doing business with this company. Read the other reviews before considering this product	neg
Net10 cell phones are great, but don't buy this card.  Net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards.  I put the pin # in my phone and did not receive the minutes.

I was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that I will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days.

This set is perfect for my daughter's new toy oven (miele) that she received for Christmas.  The pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans.  One of my utensils already broke apart, but that happens.  I have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook, but she IS 3 and is not always careful.  Not sure whether that utensil wasn't made well enough or it's a 3 year old's play, but the rest of the set seems fine.  I would recommend this and the Miele oven	pos

This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again	neg
     This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, "I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry "Flash" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity	neg
So far the device has entirely lived up to expectations.  Atomic Clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other, but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter). ---  --- The only issue we ran into that was "problematic" was the Ice Alarm feature.  This feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions.  The problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long...so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so. ---  --- We just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly.  The ice alarm only works on Channel 1.  So, if you set the outside sensor to Channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered.  Obviously, they should have an ability to shut it off, but this is it...and even this isn't listed in the instructions	pos

Gotta say I LOVE this Step and even more so the DEAL: Not only do you get The Step, but you also get FOUR raising-blocks *AND* a Step-workout dvd -- All for under $50!!! I think that's a bargain compared to buying the pro-equipment (I think it was $70-80 for the pro Step and $40-50 for two raising blocks, plus $15 for a DVD... that's, like, $140-150!). ---  --- The Step *is* smaller than the Steps you're probably used to from the gym, BUT it's not *that* much smaller -- I would say it's about 25% shorter length-wise.  It's gotta be though, I mean it's an at-home Step so they're making it more storable.  I guess if you're a big person it might be a little frustrating at first, but I don't see how you couldn't adjust to it.  Then again, I'm 5'2 & petite so for me it's the perfect size! haha :P ---  --- The DVD is pretty good.  It's pretty simple, basic stepping though, so if you're an advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast.  However, it does get you to sweat a little, so it's not a complete waste.  If not for the stepping, though, keep it for the abs workout -- OMG it's AMAZING!! For only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide. haha  Which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but FLAT. :)  But really, it's a good DVD, especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don't want to (at least not too hard). LOL ---  --- Buy this kit, it's a *great* deal and it'll get you in shape! :	pos

The biggest disappointment was that after 6 months, the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole- maybe in the seams (thus patch would not work).  Kel-Gar does not warranty the product, and the store that the tub came from (via amazon) only offered a 90 day warranty.   ---  --- Also, the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub- only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub, the rest flows behind it.  Thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill	neg
Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.  Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit!  I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk!  The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive.  Save your money and save the headaches!  Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster	neg
This game is a clever combination of UNO and Rummykub. Very entertaining and can be played with kids as well as adults. It allows me to add my own special "rules" to make it more interesting. If you like cards, you'll love this game	neg
My daughter at U of M got me interested in the Rwandan crisis and was just vacationing in Canada and picked up this book by a Canadian General who was leading the UN effort in Rwanda during the genocide and what a tragedy this  was and remains. I didnt walk away thinking this guy was a great General but he had the guts and the commitment to right to stay in spite of the ineptitude of the United Nations and Cofi Anan who was in a key role at the time. The tragedy of what the free world stood by and let happen is nearly unsurpassed, probably only by the Jews extermination in WWII. If you have any interest in the world happenings and think you have faith in the United Nations just buy this and read it - we need change.	pos
I have always loved Mario, and when I purchased my new Nintendo DS Lite, I bought this with it. This game is absolutely amazingly fun! The graphics, sound, and the game itself are incredible. This game is good for any adult or child. Although for a younger child, it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating. ;) With this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again, and possibly again after that. But every time you try again, you understand something new about the level, and it really is fun. There also are the features of becoming Mega Mario and Mini Mario which mixes things up every once and a while. This game is wonderful, definitely a great buy.	pos
OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team. ---  --- Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005. ---  --- Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock? ---  --- HELP!!	neg
This is the best shaver I've ever used.  It shaves closer and quicker than the many Norelcos I've used, all of which costed a lot more than the R-960.  The only improvement I'd like to see is in the battery, which does not really maintain its strength well between charges	pos
Srudy phone during all scenarios. MP3 player is great, no compatibility problems. The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone. The camera is more than decent, (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) No problems what so ever, the design is rather smart and simple, without the lack of elegance. The flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably, and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. Tiny design details that make it a Sony product. AMAZING battery life, surprising for an MP3 phone	pos
"Discipleship Journal" does what many other Christian magazines do not do. It provides instruction, and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a Christ-focused faith. While others may talk about Christianity, DJ asks you to pursue Christ through responding to Scripture. ---  --- This isn't an evangelistic magazine, like "Decision," or an encouraging magazine, per se, like "Moody." It is for the Christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what God's word says. ---  --- It is not for the passive pew sitter. This for the Christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between Sundays. ---  --- There is nothing watered-down here. It is published by NavPress, who, like their counterparts, the college ministry Navigators, know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday Christian. Whether it is a discussion about Satan's favorite lies, how to study a particular book of the Bible, or an explanation of what prayer is an is not, DJ is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid-page and realize something new about our Lord and his ways. ---  --- This is a great tool for two or three people to use together. Even a small group... to go through the articles, week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life. I've even heard of CCD and Sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week's class. ---  --- I fully recommend "Discipleship Journal." Expect your faith to grow. ---  --- Anthony Trendl  --- editor, HungarianBookstore.co	pos
I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.	neg

For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it. 	pos

Don't let the size of the box fool you.    Even though this item comes packaged in a good-sized box, this product is barely one inch by two inches.  It's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it.    Although it does seem to attract flies for a few days, it doesn't seem to last for very long at all.   It's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic!  In my opinion, it's just not worth it	neg
I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!

I replaced my baby's old bumper with this one when she became mobile.  It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats.

There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation. ---  --- So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation. ---  --- "The Virgin Spring" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought. ---  --- It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of "The Virgin Spring" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, "The Virgin Spring" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film. ---  --- "Last House on the Left," however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the "torture cinema" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market. ---  --- Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of "The Virgin Spring."  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.    ---  --- And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.

Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. ---  The last track with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly	pos

Seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix! One canister makes 40 cups of broth, which makes it incredibly inexpensive. It's also delicious. It makes a truly versatile soup base.

It works for people with allergies and food sensitivities (no gluten, no lactose, no MSG, no soy). It's all natural and vegetarian (no gelatin).

I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back.  If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats.  When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats.  The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats.  Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon.  I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon	neg
Melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands, and I really like that each pod is individually wrapped.  I bought this because the Senseo Hazelnut was not in stock at the time.  Caution Senseo coffee maker users: The Melitta pod does not fit well in the Senseo pod holders.  The single pod holder is too small for the Melitta pod, and the double pod holder is too big for one Melitta pod, too small for two Melitta pods.  I found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side, but this may only be because I used it in a Senseo machine.   	neg
There oughta be a law.  ---  --- I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need. ---  --- Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)	neg

This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too happy about having his record broken.  Then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo "a giant worm is our god, whoo we hate cars".   Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling facility.  Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister.  The last episode is, by far, the best.  A hockey ghost is terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest whimps ever!  I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy.  ---  --- Joey 	pos

For two years I suffered with four herniated discs.   Physical therapy, a spinal injection , chiropractic adjustments, and many sessions on a spinal decompression machine provided short term relief.  I started using the McKenzie Method extension exercises, and this offered the most relief.  Fortunately, I finally discovered the Lumbar Extender in an internet ad.  I noticed that it placed the spine in a similar position as the McKenzie exercises.  So, I decided to order the Lumbar Extender to determine if it would provide better relief than all the other methods I was using.   ---  --- The first two weeks that I used the Lumbar Extender, I had some minor discomfort.  Now after five weeks using the Lumbar Extender, I can honestly say that my back has not felt better in two years.  This device does all that it says it will do.  I actually enjoy lying on it for two seven-minute sessions each day-one session in the morning and one session at night.   ---  --- When I first used the device, I heard snapping noises in my lower back, probably the spinal facets being repositioned, and then I would experience immediate relief.  Now I feel as if I have better posture and better curvature to my lumbar region.  The cost of the Lumbar Extender is low compared to a visit to a doctor, and it is worth trying.  I highly recommend it	pos

This game is great. Both the missions and the things you do on your own (like extortion) make this game an awesome part of anyone's collection. I only found one thing wrong with the game. When you reach the rank of "Don", everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel. For instance, when talking to one of the corleone men, they will still say something like, "hey kid stay outta trouble". This game, although great, can still use a little fine tuning.	pos

This unit is well-built, will last, and is easy to use.  Assembly is a breeze.  We have had it almost two years and it performs superbly in all types of cooking-- it heats up quickly (and gets HOT!), yet the flames can be turned way down and never blow out.  We use it several times a week and a propane canister lasts about three to four weeks.  Of course, if you turn all its mighty burners on and leave 'em that way, it'll eat a lot of propane.  But that kind of usage would quickly cremate anything you might be cooking.  I suspect that people who complain about propane consumption with this barbecue are cooking with the hood up, contrary to Weber's instructions (and common sense).  And, let's face it, any barbecue with six mighty burners like these will use its share of propane. ---  --- Pluses:  ---  --- Thick, solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully and will last forever.  You want solid bars!  The thermal inertia is key to good grilling.  And stainless means no rusty taste, no chipping, and easy to clean. ---  --- Fine flame control.  Six burners let you configure the heat the way you want.  The rotisserie and smoker box have thier own burners!  The side burner works well too for cooking veggies and stuff in a pot.   ---  --- Powerful yet capable of gentle cooking. ---  --- Won't rust. ---  --- Built like a tank. ---  --- No cheap Chinese componentry as often found in even formerly premium brands, and all "house brands", most of which are made entirely in China, even the big stainless-steel extravaganzas that sell for thousands.  Don't be fooled by fancy knobs and gewgaws-- the quality is just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today.  I've personally witnessed two big top-of-the-line house brand barbecues returned to a leading warehouse retailer by irate purchasers who couldn't believe they'd crap out after a year.  That never happens with Weber. ---  --- Convenient fold-down work surfaces. ---  --- Easy to clean. ---  --- Huge cooking area. ---  --- Anti-flare burner configuration works well. ---  --- Lights instantly. ---  --- Easy to wheel around the yard-- something I wanted to be able to do, and which a built-in wouldn't allow. ---  --- Fantastic Weber service.  Mine was manhandled by the shipping company; Weber handled my complaint with the shipping company for me (I didn't have to do anything at all) and sent me a new panel without any hassle at all.  Their 24-hour support hotline is the best I've used anywhere for any product, and emails are handled same-day. ---  ---  --- Negatives: ---  --- Expensive (but worth it).  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  It was my first Weber after years of thinking they were only popular because they're stylish.  Now I get it. ---  ---  --- 	pos

The Rosetta Stone language software was a great investment. The product provides learning words together with listening, seeing, and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases.

i find these soaps to be very good. There are actually 4 different kinds I believe one also for sensitive skin. If someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards,perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product, or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type.

This stuff is great.  My wife and I use it to label things we don't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains.  It goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time.  The glue on the back (once the backing is peeled) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off.  The printing will "wear off" if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack.  However, it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary. ---  --- BTW, if I did not have fingernails, I could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip.  There ought to be suggestions from Brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label	neg

Thirteen years after we heard Randall and Dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first Clerks soundtrack, now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is, in fact, the REAL trilogy.  And we, the Clerks fans, get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track. ---  --- Oh, and did I mention the music?  Terrific!  Kevin Smith's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie.  It's not too difficult to imagine that Kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time.  In typical Kevin Smith fashion, the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises.  You've got your typical Soul Asylum and Alanis Morrisette as well as King Diamond and an unexpected Jackson 5 dance number.   ---  --- If you have not seen the movie, please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack.  Doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them.  Overall, a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any Clerks fan.    	pos
None of that super-sugared [candied] dried fruit or flat tasting candy [e.g., chocolate] chips to mess up a yummy, but healthy snack. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate--the darker the better--but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing. If I want candy, I'll buy the good stuff.  ---  --- Thanks, Amazon. My local market no longer carries it	pos
The clock is great. My son has one from Discovery Store and loves it and it does a lot of things well. I bought one for my nephew through this Amazon link and they never sent it. My inquiry generated an email that everyone in their company was fired for doing a bad job and we would get a credit!! Discovery's price is higher but it is still a good deal for $30 and at least you actually get the clock	neg
I mean come ON, who needs 5 blades right? ---  --- Well, after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the Mach III was over a twin head razor, I decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so I took the plunge, and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations.  ---  --- The first thing I noticed was that this new Fusion has a more powerful engine than the Mach III. The second thing I found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore. And I find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about. But I do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what I mean. haw haw 5 Blade	pos
I was a Norton user for a long time.  I think this is a better program -- lighter, leaner, easier to use.  It automatically updates frequently.  I've never had a virus.  I use wireless and I can always tell if someone is trying to use my system (which is never, but I've tried to break in myself just to check.)  Nice program	pos

I've read all of the reviews . I too own this model . It does what it was designed to do . BURLWOOD is much more ....overpriced ? People sometimes need to be taken by the hand .

These little nibs are very bitter.  I wouldn't recomend poppin them straight from the bag.  They were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner, dip with chunked fruit, lay on tray covered with wax paper, and refridgerate for 20 min.  The chocolate hardens.  Raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works!  Also, very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate.  This is a great product for experimental food people.  Straight out of the bag... disappointing	pos
I bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate. --- I was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but I was not dissapointed. This perfume is absolutely fabulous! When you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes. The middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy. And the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping. --- Buy this perfume. You will fall in love with it	pos
gimmick. --- There are a number of rerouting oil change kits available. Why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail? The oil filter seals itself very well on most engines. While it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles, I wouldn't risk hose failure for a little convenience. On my Toyota truck I discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter. I'm not sure that many people even change their own oil. It's cheaper to take it to the Toyota dealer, 29.95 and they even rotate the tires.	neg

I purchased these the other day. I received them on the 11th of Jan 2007 --- I ordered some other ones before, 100ct box slim jims which were very good but unfortunately, they kept revising my order from Dec 19th until Jan 10th so, I canceled the order because it was taking way too long. I thought these would be just as good. ($15 dollars more than the 100ct box, But just as good & there's 180 of them, instead of 100).  WRONG! --- These are really bad. They were all dried out & hard as rocks, and  to top it off, They expire on the 24th of Feb. Less then a month from now. I've never had this problem with Amazon before. Usually their stuff is fresh. You will not be able to return them either. Once they are opened you are stuck with them. I contacted Amazon about this problem & they gave me a little of my money back. I will not be buying these in the future. Amazon must have had these for quite some time for them to be so bad.	neg
This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired. ---  --- There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards.  I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome. ---  --- The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards. ---  --- There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)	neg
I was so frustrated with those so called "sticky mats", my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog.  --- So I decided to give the $50 skidless yoga towel a try. --- This worked pretty well for my slipping hands, but i had a new problem.  I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga.  (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle).  I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences. --- I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel. --- I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you.  I just thought I would give my 2 cents	neg
"Splash" is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then. I actually saw this movie when it was first released, which is rare for me since I was only a kid back in the 80's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days. I first bought it on VHS, eventually upgraded to the bare-bones DVD, and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie. ---  --- Both Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple. What's also believable in this movie is Daryl Hannah's mermaid costume, which looks so authentic that one almost believes she's really a mermaid. And let's not forget the movie's ending, which is absolutely perfect. There's one thing about this movie that I've never understood though: how did it ever manage to escape a PG-13 rating? In the scene where Daryl Hannah arrives at the Statue of Liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial (and may I add, very nice) shot of her buns. Definitely not material for a PG rated movie. In any event, I guess that will always be a mystery. ---  --- All in all, "Splash" is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it. Everyone is great to watch, including hilarious supporting roles by the late John Candy (R.I.P.) and Eugene Levy. Now if only they would release a special edition DVD of "Big," another Tom Hanks classic	pos
I guess you get what you pay for. ---  --- This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered. ---  --- It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily. ---  --- I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person. ---  --- It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it	neg
Ever feel like you want that "little something" with your tea or coffee, but you abstain because you're on a diet?  That was a problem for me, at least.  I've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight.  Well, just when I'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative, along came Dr. Kracker spelt muesli crackers!  They are all natural, contain no white flour or sugar, DO have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea!  Highly recommended	pos
As a guitar and harmonica player who plays out in small clubs it is very hard to find a quality harmonica holder that perfectly holds 10 hole harmonicas .When your specialty is Bob Dylan Neal Young and Donavan covers you have to have a dependable holder that does not slip.This product is perfect for that type of music.I bought two so that I could have one set up in G and the other set up in D to cut down on set up time	pos
As soon as I got it out of the box and put the batteries in, it didn't work at all. My husband checked it out and we noticed that the plastic was out of place and the little motor fell out of it's place. Well my husband clicked everything bak in place and the darn thing still wouldn't work. We returned it the next day and got our money back. Didn't even bother for a replacement because is so flimsy we were afraid of getting another one just like the first one. In ALL it was a great dissapointmen	neg

This was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about $5.00 at any hardware store. It cost me a total of $23.00 after shipping for this product. It doesn't even look like the picture. It isn't black with Angelcare written on it. It is literally a normal, brown piece of board. It's blatant false advertizing. I feel sick, not to mention a total idiot for thinking I would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor. If you have the Angelcare Movement Sensor monitor and don't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard. Do not buy this. It is a disgrace	neg
I use these almost every morning. They're hot and ready to go in seconds. I like the nonslip surface of the curlers.

I just used this product in a bath. It's supposed to be a Cinnamon smelling bubble bath, shampoo rinse, shower gel. Well first of all, I almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon, this is REALLY weak smelling. (I am a real scent meister too.) I used it as a bubble bath, guess what? The bubbles were gone within minutes. Stick with the Avon bubble bath, it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done! Then I used it as a shampoo. Guess what? It didn't lather! I ended up using the trusty Suave to finish the bath. Very disapointing product! I bought the 32oz. for myself as a Christmas present, can't wait till it's gone	neg
Not much to say about a battery.  I installed it - it works fine	pos
If you know the movies inside and out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan.  I play with my son that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the game enjoyable.  The only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck.  Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so many questions wrong	pos
This swim jock is a great all around jock.  Very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps.  Mine has taken a beating, and has not fallen apart like other jocks I own.  The swim style is cut very low in front, with a fairly small pouch.  Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!  If you're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear, this jock is a great buy for the price. 	pos

I wish there was a space for zero stars.  We bought this frame for my in-laws for Christmas and it worked for TEN MINUTES and then died.  It was definitely a fault unit and gauging by the other reviews on here, others have had a problem with it freezing.  Once it does that, there's no fixing it, apparently.  Do some research and buy another unit; that's what I'm going to do	neg

I got custom fit for this bra at Nordstrom's and I am so happy that I purchased it - among others that day. I had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down. Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra. It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a "light" 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a "bump" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to "them" being so "out there in front." So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you. I love it so much that I now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as I am very fair skinned.	pos

I must admit that I am a guy and that I bought this movie before seeing it. I was not shocked with the horrible acting, but was surprised with the hot stars. This movie had both hot guys and girls. The actor that caught my eye was Steven Albrecht "Freddy", he is so hot. We get see him completely nude showing off his hot body.  He did a great job in his breif scene. Josh Edwards "Trian" was okay to look at too. As for the actress...Venesa Taylor is also hot	neg
These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market. The  whole line is more desert like in concept, so of course they are sweet & chewy. People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying!! ---  --- The food is safe for celiac, and most food allergens (AGAIN READ THE LABEL BASED ON YOUR DIETARY SITUATION!) ---  --- The bars travel very well and although they may bend and mush, because they are naturally moist and chewey, melting? Never. All the bars in this line travel great and can sit for months in hot or cold. ---  --- These are particularly good for athletes and people on the run. ---  --- Oh, and the price, come on, there is nothing else that even comes close for the size and quality	pos
My husband is away (military) and I was looking for the perfect, small but clear, pictures for him.  I didn't care about the frame, only the small white digital system.  I was hesitant, as my MIL has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible.  I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an SD card and transferring pictures from the computer.  I love that I can use either batteries or the included plug.  Everything was soooo easy that I did not even need to read the instructions to begin.  I also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later.  This is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable.  Perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are!  Then, when he comes home, it's great for a portable album to carry anywhere	pos
It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift	pos
I love this shampoo.  My husband bought it but I definitely use it more than he does:)  Anyway, it smells amazing and really works well with my unruly hair	pos

Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.  ---  --- However, the "repair broken shortcuts" function does not work properly.   ---  --- For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File  system.   System Mechanic "repaired broken shortcuts" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target.   Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences,  since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut. ---  --- Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever.  	neg

While I thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie, this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies.  All have their funny moments.  I still enjoy the first the best.  Mainly because the jokes were original and fresh.  Though it is still funny to see the strange things Jim would get himself into.  Levy as his father was a great choice.  This is worth the 20 dollars easy.  Lots of laughs, and plenty of gross out humor	pos
I love the JLab MiniBlaster because no matter where I go I can have my favorite music with me.  The sound is clear and I found this product easy to use.

The delivery was prompt, and I appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions	pos
Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually bought this shaver to use on my head. I have been shaving my head for the past 2 years and during that time have used a Panasonic ES8066. It was a fine product (able to be used either wet or dry, unlike the Braun), but I had no idea that upgrading to the Braun 8985 would make such a difference. I shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the Panasonic! No longer did I need to keep going over the same spot again and again. The Braun took off the hair in one or two passes, cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation. I can't believe I wasted two years shaving with my old shaver! I know Panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers, and I can't comment on its new Vortex shaver, but I know I won't be returning my new Braun any time soon	pos
I foolishly purchased 7.0.  It worked ok for a few months then just kept hanging up my system.  Funny, it started hanging up when 7.5 was released.

I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in. 	neg

My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book	neg
I in 1996 I bought and read All the Pretty Horses first. Laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  Bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading Pretty Horses on the way.  Along with scenes from the Orchard Keeper, Sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that I'd rather see more of.  Sutree made me feel that I know this man, and could even like him.  Great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading.	pos
I put off buying this for many years.  Having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous, I didn't want to taint my perceptions of the Queen legacy.  So I ignored this album.  Then, one day, I was listening to Innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again.  I came here and read many positive reviews, so I took the plunge.  I came out the other side very content. The legacy had not been tainted. ---  --- The album is uneven in places, but the songs that are good are VERY good (Mother Love, Let me Live).  With some albums like this, it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in.  Now, I don't know exactly how this was done, but the songs feel seamless, even the dance track "You Don't Fool Me," which I can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club.  Of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out (especially in "Mother Love"), but upon the conclusion of the album, I want to say to the Brian and the boys (men), "You've done good.	pos

This is by far the best tea you will ever find if you like a bold, in your face, but not overwhelming taste of cinnamon & oranges instead of just flavored water like other teas.   ---  --- You must be very careful handling the tea bags from the essential oils they use.  I love to smell tea so I placed the tea bag to my nose and took a whiff, then cried for the next 30 minutes as my nose was on fire!!  No amount of water or soap could remove the burning from the oils that were displaced on my nose.  Also don't directly touch it or reach into the bag with acrylic nails.  I ruined a fresh french manicure and learned the hard way - the essential oils leave a green film on your nails that takes days to wear off. ---  --- Other than that, just try it once and you will be hooked like all the others!  My boss introduced this to me after she came back with it from a trip to Seatle.  I've been ordering it ever since along with all my other co-workers who became a addicted.  It will brighten any day!!!!!! 	pos
Craig Cockran has reprized his first work with a text that is as rich as it is inspiring.

This bracelet is very simple and elegant. The pavé cz has a great sparkle, but isn't overboard. I also like the fact that it's a rolo bracelet--the links are delicate and small, but very sturdy and have a nice gleam to them. Furthermore, the charm "O" is a nice style and doesn't look gaudy. There are some tiny little dots on the back of the charm (not so sure what those are all about). ---  --- This bracelet looks great stacked on top of my silver bracelet watch. Wearing any bracelet can make it hard to type, but this one is cool because you can actually peg it nice and tight to your wrist by wrapping the "stick" part of the clasp beneath the rolo chain if you want it out of the way.  ---  --- I get compliments every time I wear this bracelet; so, it's nice that it supports a good cause since it does get noticed. Obviously, if you're looking for fine jewelry, this might not be your choice, but as they say, "Diamonds are forever, but CZ is for right now." ;-) ---  --- I would recommend this for those in their teens, but even for women in their twenties and thirties who like the whole sterling-silver bling-thing. Also, definitely recommended for those interested in supporting good causes such as ovarian cancer awareness.	pos

This clock's display contains all the information necessary to prove that the time and date displayed are the actual time and date, assuming the clock is in the radio-controlled mode (that is, unless someone is willing to take extraordinary measures such as swamping-out the WWVB signal with an equivalent signal containing false data).  ---  --- According to the owner's manual, the presence of the antenna icon indicates that the clock is in the radio-controlled mode.  When this icon and the associated signal-strength bars are flashing, the clock is in the process of synchronizing to the NIST reference.  If either two or four signal-strength bars are displayed, there is sufficient signal for the clock to synchronize.  If no bars are displayed, it is not safe to assume that the clock is synchronized. ---  --- The display also contains a time-zone map of the US with the selected time zone darkened, and either "AM" or "PM" next to the antenna icon, thus eliminating two more reasons to question the displayed time. ---  --- Although the year is not explicitly displayed, it can be derived from the display when the user chooses to display the day of the week instead of seconds. 	pos
This clarifying lotion is too harsh. I used it once and my skin is itchy, dry and red. I think I'm allergic to it. Basically, the chemicals in these products are really harmful.

Unfortunately, my number of photos from these times are limited to a handful as I hated looking like a "tourist" with my bulky camera!  Nowadays, I no longer have to worry about that because of cameras like this one!  I intially bought this T7 after using a friend's T1 and being impressed with the size of it.  The T7 is obviously considerably smaller, which is even better!   ---  --- I bought this camera right as they were coming out and paid well over $400 for it plus a 1GB Memory Stick Pro.  Both are investments that even to this day (over a year later) I am very happy with.  I have taken this camera just about everywhere and wherever I go people love to look at it.  I can say I've probably sold at least a dozen of these to people that fell in love with the size of the camera and the quality of photos it takes.   ---  --- As far as size, that is the biggest plus to it's advantage.  It can fit anywhere.  Even with the optional case that you can buy for it, it still easily fits in a trouser or jacket pocket, without even a noticable bulge.   ---  --- As far as photo quality goes, as most of the reviews note, the camera is very limited when it comes to night time shots.  I've found that these shots are often hit and miss as far as what you'll get, but for the size of the lens and the size of the flash, what can you expect?  After shooting a few thousand photos with this camera, I know what will be a good and bad night shot, and with the playback feature, you can quickly see the quality of your photo and retake if needed.  Is it perfect? No, but that's super tough in a camera this small. ---  --- Some reviews note the difficulty trying to take a photo while holding the camera still.  I've never had issue with this, but I could see how it could be an issue, it's just never one either my wife (the primary user) or I have dealt with.  I would venture that probably the vast majority of buyers of this camera will likewise not have a problem. ---  --- I've recorded more than a few .mpg movies with the camera and it surprisingly outperformed some of my bigger (and more expensive) point-and-shoot digital cameras.  I have been very pleased with that.   ---  --- Another drawback noted by many reviews is the LCD screen and the chance of breaking it.  I put a plastic screen protector (the thin plastic sheet type held by static) on it as soon as I bought it and haven't had a problem.  I've sat on the camera before (by accident, of course!) and have had it in luggage and the like, but have never had a problem. ---  --- The most significant drawback that I've had with the camera is that it can take more photos (esp with the 1GB card) than the battery will last.  Buy a second battery and you'll be more than good, but it's just something to keep in mind. ---  --- I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who travels, or anyone who wants a camera to take quick photos.  It can be carried anywhere and for the vast majority of shots, it's all that you need. I can say that we have many photos of our kids (and really good ones, too) that we would never had gotten if my wife didn't regularly carry this camera in her purse and diaper bag! I'm happy enough with it that I'm going to buy a second one for myself (especially now that the prices have dropped so much!) so that my wife can use our first one entirely for her own photography.  I give it five stars and would definately recommend it to others	pos
This book is a five star book!!!! I love it so much!!! Partly becuase I like mystery/adventurous books and I would recommend this to all of the people who like mystery/adventure. It is a GREAT book about a GREAT family when everything goes wrong when Janie Jonhson decides she wants to drink milk and when she looks at the back for the kidnapped kid - she learns too much..	pos
The glasses are well made but I found them awkward to use. They didn't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on. The gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well for me. Every head is different, so maybe they'll work better for you	neg
This is a very good shaver for the private area.  However, the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first.  This will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work.  The foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long. ---  --- The only problem I had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed.  However, I use the 'mangroomer' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle.  it is a great product as well. ---  --- Therefore, I would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men's grooming on the body.  I would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results	pos
   There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss. ---  ---     The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound. 'Where are you Christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and I mean both versions. And whose bright idea was it to have Jim Carrey mangle 'You're a Mean One'? ---  ---  ---    If you're looking for a more Grinch like score, go find Elfman's Nightmare Before Christmas	neg
Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries, put it this way, you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days, and that is not cool at all! I will be buying the wire controlers from now on,  ---  --- The premium system should have included the battery charger im othere than this MAJOR ISSUE the controller is great, but again let me stresss this issue,... ---  ---  it is not fun to be in the middle of an online fight in Fight Night 3 and have your controller (that you just put batteries in, well at least you thought you did) die, and get you knocked out when you were clearely winning the fight	neg
A refreshing look on software development and the many pitfalls you need to avoid.  This book should be read by everybody involved in any software project but the simplest. In my opinion, a standard work.  Nevertheless, it needs to be handled with care.  During ages, SW development managers have tried convincing their people to break out of the chaos, and plan their work.  This book correctly warns for the opposite effects of believing that planning solves everything. Some people might however read between the lines that no planning at all is the best practice. The book confirms what I and my successful colleagues found through experience and intuition: there is an optimal point of planning upfront.  Less harms because you don't know where you are going, more (too detailed) harms because it takes away flexibility and it slows you down significantly.  --- New to me was the use of queuing theory to point out what we see every day: too many features, under-resourcing leads to far bigger delays than human mind can ever guess.	pos

I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of "Chocolate Pieces". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me	neg
I recently finished reading this book. This is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour. It would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book. ---  --- Some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself. While I am not qualified to comment  on these reviews, one thing I can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it. A theory, that too developed quarter century ago, can not be expected to stand 100% vindicated today. The more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to. So may be for a psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things. After reading this book I could find out why I behave the way I behave mostof the times. To a certain extent I learnt to control my responses. Also I have a feeling that the claims made by Dr. Harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge, then prevalent.  ---  --- Second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people. I think this conclusion is far from correct. Dr. Harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to "I am not ok and you are ok" category. Out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual. The objective here is not to merely categorize, but to show that how most of us have the common position "I am not ok and you are ok". Now this should not be taken as a gross simplification of human nature, but as a fundamental problem in human psycology that prevents one from producing rational responses.  ---  --- Third critisism on this book stems from the fact Dr. Harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree 100%. It seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100% with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon. I don't think Dr. Harris wrote this book to declare to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic thought 100%. The books surely derives from various thoughts put forward by various intellectuals (with whom he does not agree 100%) for the benefit of the reader. To call this approach pretentious is pretentious iteself. ---  --- I feel that reader should not by biased by comments made by reviewers. Read this book with an open mind. Read the chapeters on PAC and marriage, PAC and children, PAC and social implications, PAC and moral values. In this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other day, it tries to teach something good (and this good is not subjective or relative but absolute). Thanks	pos

Two huge problems with this book. One, this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and "traveling and learning" when they already know his identity, so I guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass. Two, the city of Los Angeles functions as a character in Kellerman's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels. This thing drags on in some unnamed, nondescript city	neg

I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors. None of us had played before, so we didn't need top-of-the-line, and the price was right on this set. It's everything it needs to be: weighty, colorful, and compact in its case. The widgets are pretty bendy, but if they bend out of shape, they bend right back. Turned out to be a good investment. A word of warning if you have small dogs: put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles. My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course. It was funny, until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball, which made solid contact with her little head. (She's fine now, but is no longer a fan of the game.) All in all, I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors	pos
I got this bra when I was pregnant and wore it confortable until my delivery.  After my delivery the bra was too small.  With the engorged breast after delivery and just carrying mature milk afterwards it is just too small.  I wasn't told that my breast would get even larger after delivery.  I thought they were big just before delivery.   ---  --- I decided to go w/ bravado bra.  It has worked out much better.  It is comfortable to wear day and night. And as the milk comes in and out it is comfortable either way.  The sizes are more flexable then medela.  The strap support is better then medela. ---  --- I have packed up the medela bras and will just use them during pregnancy if i have another.  No use for them when i am not pregnant or for breastfeeding.  And breastfeeding is their main purpose	neg
Star Wars: Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast. The third game in the Star Wars Dark Forces series. ---  --- INTRODUCTION: --- I've pretty much always been a fan of Star Wars, and as you may have guessed, I'm a fan of many of the games based on the series. Although Star Wars games are often hit and miss, when one succeeds, it usually succeeds beautifully. One of the most interesting ideas for a Star Wars game was Dark Forces, released for the Playstation One and the PC. Although the game itself was horrendous, with a terribly-choppy framerate and very poor level design, it was something the world had never seen before - a Star Wars first-person shooter. The sequel, Jedi Knight, cleaned up a lot of the problems, and added in some new innovations. And now the third game in the series, Jedi Outcast, has arrived. Like previous games in this sub-series, it has gotten a multi-console release. Read on to see how it fares! ---  --- OVERVIEW: --- Jedi Outcast is a Star Wars first-person shooter. The game has a one-player quest, as well as several different multiplayer modes.  ---  --- REVIEW: --- To put it simply, this game is everything the original Dark Forces should have been. While not perfect, this game is a huge improvement over its predecessors. Once again you play the role of Kyle Katarn, the agent from the other Dark Forces titles. The second Death Star has been destroyed, but many Imperial forces still fight on, so it's up to you to infiltrate their hideouts and exterminate them. The graphics are, for the most part, solid. I was impressed at how good they are for this kind of game. Nothing state-of-the-art, but they're still pretty damn good. Control has also been given an overhaul and rightfully so, since this game lets you use force powers and wield a lightsaber. The single-player mode is extremely entertaining, and the fact that the game offers multiplayer options only adds to the overall value of the package. And you can save whenever you want to in the single-player mode! But, of course, the game isn't perfect. Like earlier Dark Forces games, the level design just is not that good. Too many areas look alike, and there are too many instant death spots that are just too easy to fall into. Likewise, in many cases your objectives are unclear, and some of the puzzles are a pain - I don't know about you, but I buy first-person shooters to shoot people, not solve puzzles! Because of the imbalanced puzzles and often poor level design, it took me over an hour just to beat the first level! Another huge problem is availability. Lack of custom control configuration also plagues the game. This is a huge problem, since the game's limited control selections will often clash with what you're used to for this sort of game. This game wasn't released on the consoles in very high quanitites, so you're likely gonna have to shell out the full new price just to get a USED copy - and in my mind, it's NOT worth that price. Sad but true. I do recommend this game to Star Wars fans, just be warned that it's not perfect, and it's hard to get a copy. ---  --- EDITION NOTES: --- This is a good game, but for some strange reason it just wasn't available on the consoles for very long. Because of this, even USED copies fetch close to the original new retail price. This is extremely annoying for people like me who want to get every Star Wars game. Still, you should hunt it down if you're into this sort of thing. ---  --- OVERALL: --- Overall this is the best game in the Dark Forces sub-series thusfar. Where the game succeeds, it succeeds beautifully. I am impressed with the game, it's just a shame the consular version was not made readily available to all would-be players. I strongly recommend this game if you can get a hold of it - I doubt it will disappoint any Star Wars fan	pos
I've had this unit for almost 3 years.  It works great. I installed it per manufacturers recommendations.  I was careful with it to not damage it.  The software is great for communication via internet.  I have found the measurements to be very accurate.  I would buy this again.  I'm sure the competition has nice units too.  But I really like how this one works.  The rain guage works great.  What I'd really like is a snow guage	pos

Issue solved!  I returned the Harmony for a full refund.  All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team.  After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said "level 2" would contact me within 24 hours. ---  --- After waiting 72 hours, I called "support" again yesterday.  After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who "could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."  This was after providing the incident number.  That took another 15 minutes.  I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave. ---  --- I tried again several hours later.  After being told "level 2 was not available."  I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to .... ---  --- Thanks, Logitech. ---   -Keit	neg

The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle. 	neg

I am very happy with this product. It's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it.  ---  --- I had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over. But my brother fiddled with it and discovered that (unlike the rope in the picture) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it's not right up against the handle. So now I would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it (and the sellers should have known that).      	pos

Just to add my 2 cents to an already glowingly-reviewed title, a couple more clues as to how well-received this game was: ---  --- 1. After selling through the initial stock, Capcom stopped shipping copies of the game. An uproar from the gaming community ensued and existing copies started selling for 2-3 times the SRP in online auctions before Capcom announced that they will ship more copies.  ---  --- 2. At E3 there was a trailer revealed for a Phoenix Wright sequel on the DS, which is the sequel to the original game in Japan but will be titled in the USA as "Justice For All". ---  --- If you are up for unconventionally written games with quirky charm, this is a fun title to sit back, relax and laugh with.	pos
This was given to us as a present, but I would have never bought it for myself.  Here are the problems: 1) we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper.  We still tried to use it as a bassinet but...2) the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it.  I tried to put extra padding  which worked ok, but still not great.  3)Once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room, but the bassinet part is fixed.  I would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet.  Ultimately we happily gave it away after about 5 months	neg
Firstly, I have not seen the film adaptation of 'Single White Female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other.  This book, about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written is very easy style.  Characterizations, prose, and dialogue are all straightforward.  I can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.  And the book's "feel" is anything but original.  'Sliver' by Ira Levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in Manhattan for a single, white female.  Still, 'Single White Female' is an entertaining read. ---  ---  --- Bottom line: a very enjoyable, suspenseful read that doesn't tax the brain.  Recommended	pos

   For the first few weeks it worked fine, however, it started skipping and stopping DVDs after two months.

The unit was shipped via UPS and received on 92nd days from the purchase date, and they charged $50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired. I called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because I don't have case number issued within warranty period.

I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair.  The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort. 	pos

Companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth: More teams mean more meetings. Management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork, but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long, sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed. With teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world, meeting management, or facilitation, is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions. Author Ingrid Bens' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting. A host of charts, examples and worksheets (not to mention the accompanying CD) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome.

My son loved this tent.  He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent.  My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor.  Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent.  The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart.  The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side.  If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time?  Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build.  I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on	neg
my daughter bought these herself, because she couldn't afford the real birky's.  she bought them in august 2006, now november 18, 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday. wasted pair of shoes.  anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys??  --- pat- mother of msu college freshman	neg

I owned the VHS version of ''The Wild,Wild World'' but decided to get the DVD this winter. --- WELL..That was a great purchase ! --- I understand people that could see the documentary of Jayne in Europe,as pretty cheaply made,BUT it is still Jayne,and if you love her (as I do),any film she was in (except The Girl can't help it,and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter) was done on the cheap,with ridiculously small budgets. --- 'The Wild,Wild World' gives you the chance to see a candid Jayne in all kinds of very campy situations,and the best scenes are when Jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on... --- It shows a Jayne Mansfield who was indeed a true-original,rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive American Fifties.I can't help comparing her to what Anna Nicole Smith has done with her 'career' as a media sensation,BUT Jayne was doing basically the same FIFTY years ago,which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks. --- When Jayne talks about her film roles,you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself. --- I don't understand how she can be compared to Marilyn Monroe.MM was looking for privacy,more serious roles,spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to,when Jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.Jayne was not too picky about her roles,and the kind of attention she was getting,and it was her undoing.Sad,but she needed the money to keep up that image,all those children,dogs,and...husbands. --- NOW ,about ''The Labyrinth of Sex'': It is HYSTERICAL !! and a great choice to make the DVD a double-feature,just like the good-old days of the Drive-ins ! --- When you get over the awful dubbing,the documentary is rather well made,naive to today's standards of course,but well-intentionned.Some viewers will just see crass-exploitation,but if you are into Campy,Kitsch movies,and you see Ed Wood Jr. as a genius...well you will love IT !.The movie trailers are very funny as well,and make you wish you could find them. --- So my conclusion is that DVD is an EXCELLENT purchase,a must-have for any serious Jayne Mansfield Fan !!	pos

I won the Kodak printer at a scrapbook convention & then went on the hunt to find the refills at a reasonable price. Purchasing the 160 count made the price per print the lowest & beat out anything I could find in the local stores. It is a great convenience to be able to whip out a 4x6 print instead of having to download it to a store's website, wait a few days, go there & pick it up, etc. Great value	pos
I really liked this film.  It's not a groundbreaking movie in any way, though.  It's about a bunch of underdog kids who aren't interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds.  Throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented (and unlikeable) team.   It's pretty much the same thing we've seen in the Mighty Ducks except now it's about football.   ---  --- It's just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you're small and think you don't have any talent, you actually DO have the talent to play football, hockey, basketball, whatever.  One of the characters is a girl who doesn't know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls.   ---  --- Rick Moranis once again plays that shy, quiet character he does so well in other films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids.  It's hard to believe he's now a country singer (no, I'm not kidding).  Ed O'Neil doesn't quite play the jerk character you'd expect from the Married with Children show.  He's not really a nice guy either, though.   ---  --- I find it interesting that the team names are the Giants (the good guys) vs. the Cowboys (the bad guys) because the Monday Night Football game this week were those two teams facing each other (with the Giants winning)	pos
I bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me! So far it does what it's suppose to do.  I am pleased. It's a little clunky, and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended. We'll see how it works in 6 months	pos
My daughter wanted a doll that goes in the water last christmas.  I chose this one, and she was so pleased.  THe doll is beautiful.  She did not quite sit the right way in her raft.  Someone needs to hold the raft while the doll is in it, or it will tip. My daugther did not like that we could not just dry the doll off with a towel, so she could take it around the house with her, but that it had to hang and dry.   Still she loved this doll and it was her favorite, until two months later when the material around the leg wripped.  Instead of trying to sew it, I figured it was cheaply made and the rest would rip also, we said goodbye.  This year I am getting her another doll that goes in the bath, but I am getting the Paul Drink and wet doll by corolle.  It is a lot more expensive, but I think it will be worth it. 	neg
These have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings.  They look substantial when worn, but they are lightweight and comfortable.  They go well with either silver or white gold necklaces.  They are shiny and have a classic appearance.  Plus the snap bar locks them securely in place.  Buy them and you won't be sorry!  They also make a great gift item	pos

My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.

He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment	pos
I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements? ---  --- Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not! --- Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!   ---  --- It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on... ---  --- That's not all the changes..... ---  --- They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg. ---  --- The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers..... ---  --- The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not. ---  --- They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones. ---  --- Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches. ---  --- Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs. ---  --- Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet. ---  --- I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical. ---  --- I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product. ---  --- BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T. ---  --- IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION. ---  --- SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????	neg

The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.  Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is. ---  --- The key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol.  The gel has menthol, so that's why it can be irritating.  I read a review of shaving basics online, and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol.  The lotion, on the other hand, always helps get a better shave, and is quite soothing	neg

This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in.

Cheap and it works is really an understatement! Item is quality made. Just plug in and empty drawer every day or so. No bait or bags to buy. I ran this the last weeks of summer and could not believe the amount of dead Mosquitos in the drawer. I highly recommend this item.	pos
I really didn't enjoy this book.  I am half Italian-American, and I've read a few books about growing up in an Italian-American family in an effort to learn about my roots.  I have also read several books about 2nd generation Americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is "normal" and their immigrant parents.  I normally enjoy such books, but not this one.  I know that life wasn't always a bowl of cherries for these familes, but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible.  Yet, I couldn't find anything about the daughters' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people's lives in this country.  Where is all the anger coming from?  I really don't know.  This book is dark and depressing.  Some say it is funny at times, but I didn't think so.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish it	neg

This phone is incredible, and I'm so happy I bought it through Amazon...very good deal and smooth transaction! I definitely recommend getting this phone. Here's my run-down of it: ---  --- Pros: --- Excellent voice quality --- Excellent sound quality --- Great reception...even in places that were "dead zones" with my other phones. --- Very compact and oh so sexy sleek --- Decent battery life (MUCH better than RAZR) --- Easy to follow menu ---  --- Cons: --- Front side is a fingerprint magnet from hell --- Small screen --- No warranty available with Cingular --- Only a few backgrounds & ringtones to choose from without downloading your own ---  --- I also bought the data cable package through Amazon, and it worked beautifully from the first try.	pos
    I am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material, 'Wired' is even too tedious to fill that need. Its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled National Geographics of questionable scientific value. On the other hand the articles, for example in the latest issue, 'Are Higher Gas Prices Good for Us'(paraphrase of title) offer little information and if I had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 Nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced Operation Independance. The intention at the time was to free the U.S. from dependance on foriegn oil.  ---      Oh we of short memory, condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters!  ---      Of interest may be the dumb means by which I obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines, Playstation Magazine - now X Box Magazine, the completely amoral Men's Health, Garden Club, Cooking. I simply check the highest income level on every form I fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application.                                                       ---      Typical of something recieved for nothing  Wired  is not a publication for which I would recommend laying  out any money or time.

My first pedometer from Sportline worked only a few days (digital display completely disappeared), so I returned it to them, and after over two months and several emails from me to them, they replaced it with this Sportline 350.  The first two days, it worked fine, although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have.  The third day, in the middle of the day it said approx. 3400 steps, later that afternoon it said 1300 steps, and by nighttime the display totally disappeared, and never came back.  I just sent the second one back, and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service.  Their products seem to be very poorly made, and I don't expect to purchase any more.... after reading the reviews, I have just purchased an Omron, and am hoping it will be much more reliable	neg
I ordered this tripod, and it arrived broken. ---  --- The assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic.    I asked for an RMA order via E-Mail, and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice.' ---  --- Being lazy about mailing things back, and since it was cheap to begin with I tried repair it myself.  Where it broke (the three plastic rings on the camera mount), it was impossible to re-glue, because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure.   ---  --- Even if your tripod arrives un-broken, it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all.	neg

We purchased the Razor Scuttle Bug Trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She spends hours each day zipping around on it, and it is sturdy and lightweight. My only suggestion/complaint is that it is not adjustable in height.  She is a bit tall for her age, and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches. Would likely fit best for children ages 18 months - 2 1/2 years and under 35" tall. --- Item comes pre-assembled and folds up flat.  Highly recommended	pos
The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.

I have tried to lose weight for a long, l o n g, time.  Also for a long, l o n g time, I have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea.  It seemed ridiculous to me at first.... I mean, lose weight by DRINKING TEA?  This idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts, (which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours....after which time it comes back again!) ---  --- Well, last year I was getting pretty desperate.  I had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds....by drinking only regular tea, instant coffee, and home-made lemonade, and eating only Bird's Eye Vegetables and turkey. (In fact, I have invented the "Turkey Diet"! It's very simple: Eat Turkey, Fall Asleep (from the tryptophan!).....and if you fall asleep, you can't eat, you see.  A variation, I guess, on the "Hollywood Diet", which can be used only on weekends....because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work!)  Anyway, this diet worked for me....but it was pretty boring....took most of my free time away, and....turkey is expernsive!   I gradually stopped this diet, and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds.  I looked desperately for another way to lose weight....but drinking tea to do it just didn't logical.... ---  --- However, no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea....and after all that expensive (but delicious!), turkey, it seemd a good way to go.  Now, this particular tea itself IS quite expensive -- $43 for 4 ounces, (on sale....ouch!)....but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups, (360 ounces...and I'd of course be adding my own water and sweetener)....so I figured, why not?  (Well...because of the possible bad taste, that's why not.  I've tried herbal teas in the past, and -- with the delicious exception of Jasmine Tea -- thoroughly disliked each one.)  But even so, I decided to risk it...I've tasted far worse things than herbal tea, after all....    ---  --- So, about a year ago, I sent away for it. ---  --- When the Wu-Long tea arrived, (in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag, lined with aluminum foil, giving the impression of a crushed green diamond), I made it and drank it.  Hmmm, (or rather, "Mmmm!")  Not bad tasting at all!  It tasted like the best black tea...the kind, (other than Jasmine), that I like the best.  But,,,,as the tea was SO expensive, I decided not to drink it too often.... ---  --- As the owner of a "healthy refrigerator", (one LOADED with vitamins, which I take only in emergencies, because I can't afford to keep buying them), I now had this "healthy tea", which I put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh), to sort of keep the vitamins company!  I did throughly read the literature that came with the tea, however....and noticed that many people had praised the MEDICINAL qualities of this tea, along with it's weight-loss abilities.   Hmmm....  I decided that I had happily gotten more than I bargained for....a weight-loss tea AND one which helpoed with other health problems.  Nice to get such a bargain -- but, at $43 for 4 ounces of lose tea, it was still quite expensive.  And so, after that first cup, I restrained myself from drinking it, for quite some time..... ---  --- Actually, I didn't drink another cup until about two weeks ago!  I was beginning to feel as if the minor cut I had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in, (though the cut itself didn't look infected.) --- Anyway, I was beginning to feel very, Very, VERY w....e....a...k.....  Two years ago, in fact, I was hospitalized with an infection....the very same infection that killed my mother the month before!  My mother, in the hospital, had said that she "felt like a vegetable", and, having gotten the same infection, I knew how accurate that description really was: I was SO weak, then, in fact, I had had trouble raising my arms above my head!  And now I felt it was starting to happen again!  My first thought was to call 911.  But my second thought was, strangely, concentrated on those glowing testimonials I had read from other customers who had used Wu-Long tea.  I figured I'd try to make myself a cup....if the tea didn't work, I could always call 911....  After all, though I felt very weak, I didn't feel totally paralzyed....yet, anyway.  But I knew I had to make and drink that tea fast.....before total weakness engulfed me.  Did I feel up to doing so?  Yes....I F...took my time, I F...I was very careful, and...I F.. I stayed very near the telephone as I made the tea....just in case.... ---  --- I managed to make myself the cup of tea....to wait for it to cool down a bit....and to drink it.  Within an hour, the feeling of weakness had left me!  And, as of this writing....taking place a full two weeks later....the weakness, (and presumably the infection), have not come back! --- (OH, IF ONLY I HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO BUY THIS TEA ..T W O.. YEARS AGO, AND GIVE IT TO MY WONDERFUL MOTHER!!!!!!) ---  --- Now, I'm not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone, and in every circumstance.  The tea did NOT transform my looks to those of Princess Grace, (whom I consider the most beautiful woman of all time), and have NOT cured me of a very slight case of Myasthenia Gravis...a neuro-muscular ailment which I have had since the age of four.  I DOUBT very much that it has made me immortal, and I know for a fact that it has NOT granted me super-powers, or the ability to fly, or to transcend time. --- (No one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination! : )   HOWEVER, UPON DRINKING THAT TEA, MY FEELINGS OF INFECTION, (a feeling of weakness quite different from that of Myasthenia Gravis), DID GO AWAY!  I don't remember what the other testimonals for this tea were....but I'm sure, now, that at least 98% of them are true! ---  --- Perhaps there is no real "fountain of youth".  But this tea...which seems to cure many ailments, and most probably helps one lose weight as well, if taken often enough, seems a very close second.  Ponce de Leon would have been happy with it, I'm sure.  I don't know if it will help everyone...but I do know it helped me, (and probably the other people who gave testimonials, too.)   And that second cup of tea -- even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea -- are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital!  For those on a budget, like me, Wu-Long tea is, it seems, destined to be used as a luxury, and/or in an emergency.  But I really feel it belongs in every home.....just like aspirin does.  And -- for emergency use...PLEASE take the same precautions I did: 1) Be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea, and 2) Be near a telephone, so you can call 911, in case the tea doesn't work for you. ---  --- The tea did work for me, in the above circumstance, anyway.  An elixir of life?  Perhaps and perhaps not, depending on the person and the circumstances.   All I know is, that for me, and under the circumstances described above, it certainly seems to have saved mine! ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 	pos
I am very disappointed with this product.  Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less.  I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features	neg
Poor construction, software that is difficult to install, unable to run when installed, and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy.  Buy something else that actually works	neg
 When I ordered this item, I was kind of skeptical as to how well it would really work. I purchased it on an impulse as I was having trouble holding up my large psychology text book as I took notes on my laptop. I looked at many items and ended up choosing this one because (1) the price and; (2) its versatility. ---  When I finally got the package, I doubted its performance even more because of how light it was, but, wouldn't you know it, it holds up my large text book with no problem at all--thanks to the pop up tabs that hold it in place. And the good thing about it being light plastic is that it's flexible, so all I need to do to turn the page is pull back the page tabs and cross the page over and then it bends right back into place.  ---  I definitely recommend this item. [...].	pos

Perfect solution for using those windows programs we are used to...but on the Mac.  Runs smoothly.  Entourage is a fine email program and Word, Excel and the others work great.  A little spendy, but worth it if you need it.  Entourage communicates well with Oulook and has a similiar feel	pos

I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong.  ---  --- I will simply list the things I do not like: --- 1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had. --- 2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any. --- 3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary). --- 4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those. --- 5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks. --- 6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller.	neg
My almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy.  It is easy for her to control.  My 8 year old thinks it is boring.   --- I don't think it has any educational value. --- The controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end, so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it.	pos
This product is excellent!  Very sturdy, durable and the videos are challenging but doable - from beginner to advanced you will get the results you're after.  I highly recommend this product	pos
This game is really good! I have a real up-to-date computer so everything runs fast and smooth. The multiplayer is great! You can play 1,000's of people in a huge number of maps and game styles. You can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear! One of the down points is that in multilayer, someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing. Another thing would be the lag. This is where the game moves real "choppy" or you lose the network connection. Still, its a really fun game	pos

Well, I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle, but was out of stock at Air-Splat. Well, I could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time. So I sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. The screws, you get some screws, now on the newer versions, the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger, is not the long screw. You put in a short screw, well at least for me. I had tried to figure out what was wrong, finally decided to call them and they told me what to do. --- Now to the Gun- Excelent. Definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper. Also, have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin. It will either bleed or nice a welt, and if thats cool with you, than by all means dont tell them untill its to late. The gun itself should only be used with .20g and up. Anything less will ruin the gun. With .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda. The gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed. Personally, I stay back and take head shots at the other team's leaders and medics. With the bolt-action that you use, you can decide when you are going to relode. Also, you should also get alot of white .20g. With white .20g, you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots.  --- Pros: --- Very accurate --- Very painful (could be con, depends on how you look at it) --- Weighted well --- Very intimidating looking  ---  --- Cons: --- A bit heavy for long games (But you should be moving anyways now should you?) --- If you dont sight your scope (or dont even get one) there are no aiming sights, it would be a bit wasy to miss	pos
We purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera.  It took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today's reasonably priced miniDV camcorders.  However after six months the LCD screen suddenly stopped working.  It was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great.  We sent it last November to the Panasonic authorized service center.  They returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available.  We were out $100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old.  I only share this as a warning to potential buyers.  Panasonic did not honor our warranty	neg
I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Kolcraft Universal carrier, since they are both called the Universal carrier.  This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.  Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat. 	neg
My wife bought me this for me a couple years ago. I think she had an ulterior motive: for me to make the Thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit.

If you have a 22.5-inch Weber kettle, you need this rotisserie	pos

For the price, I expected a toy. I was surprised to open the box and find an honest to goodness classical guitar. The construction, fit and finish are impeccable.

I have told me son about it and he is going to buy one for his son.	pos
After using this product for Mac for over 10 years.  I'm done.  The price keeps going up, the "tax-help" within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non-existent.   ---  --- The server meltdown this year was the last straw.  Their servers weren't too busy to let me pay to efile.  But, apparently they were "surprised" by the number of people that they allowed to pay for their service.  Baloney.  I'll use a pencil and paper next year before I give Intuit another $100. 	neg
I've been wearing glasses for almost 25 years now.  Its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that doesn't either streak or damage the lenses -- especially with AR and other coatings they put on glasses these days.  The Sharper Image eyeglass cleaner does the trick.  It also, by design, cleans your frames which is a plus. ---  --- I would have given 4.5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply.  Its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses.  I have two pair (regular and sunglasses) so no real fault there.  I recommend getting a 3M microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied	pos

I bought htis from Amazon, and have troubles in playing back the video clips. Almost evrytime, after a while, I do see "System error" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. After a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! Some issues with the basics...so I called Sanyo service, they said this is happening because I'm using a 4GB plain SD card. Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know. ---  --- Video is okay for my need...still is too bad.  --- Firmware is just about average..not too great. There is much scope of improvement to be more user friendly and more informative with lesser use of buttons. ---  --- Battery did not perform as promised in the spec.  ---  --- Also, there are way too many components in the box for such a specialized product. I would expect those many in a robotics kit.	neg
Although I have not tried other models of the California duster, I really like this design. Since this model has dusting tassles all the way around, you simple rotate the duster after each wipe. This will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot. This design also works well for dusting the underside of my car's spoiler. ---  --- The duster really does capture dust and not just push it around. My only complaint is that the re-usable storage bag should be larger than it is to make it easier to get the duster back into it.  --- 	pos
I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself. ---  ---   First off, I am only interested in playing videos from my computer, so I have no idea how well the image viewing or MP3 playing works.   ---  ---   I also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections.  My house is fully wired with CAT5, therefore I am using this product wired, not wireless. ---  ---   I was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good.   The first thing I did was check for updates.  An update was found and updated successfully. ---  ---   I then had the DSM-320 look for media servers.  It found the tversity server right away and I was able to see the contents listed.  This unfortunately is the end of the good news.  It's all went downhill from here. ---  ---   1.  Neither server, tversity or the Dlink were smart enough to view a folder of VOB files as a movie.  They listed them as VOB_1, VOB2 etc.  So for example, I clicked on my Casablanca folder, I would then need to click on VOB_1 to start the movie.  When VOB_1 ended after about 20 minutes, it did not go to VOB_2.   I needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play.   arrrgghh!!  P.O.S. thing. ---  ---   2.  As another review stated, the FF simply does not work properly.  Oh, sure if you press FF the movie will fast forward.  But there is no way to stop it.  If you press play while the movie is FF'wding, the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current VOB.  more, arrrrgghh! --- This alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device.  Which I will be doing first thing in the morning. ---  --- My final advice to any prospective buyers:  S T A Y   A W A Y !!!! ---  --- My final advic to D-Link, Great idea, but your product absolutely sucks. ---  --- Oh one more thing,  Someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly.  Yes the two ladies I spoke to were both very friendly, their English was terrible.  (Guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on, just one guess)  It also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another.  I could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients.  Which made it very difficult for the lady helping me.  She needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over.  Sheesh,  I must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right. ---  --- One last interesting tidbit, on the packaging, they mention Nero recode CE.  So I went to the nero site to check it out.  Nero has a list of Supported Media Players listed.  And you know what, D-Link is NOT one of them.  I will return this D-Link junk and purchase one the Nero certified product instead. ---  --- I bow my head in shame, As I had read the reviews but I bought the product anyway.	neg

Worked okay until I installed XP Service Pack 2.  Now I can no longer scan using my Brother MFC-9700 and Paperport 9.  It has been a long time since Service Pack 2 was released, and Scansoft has left everyone who bought Paperport 9 in the cold.  I could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with SP2.  This kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business.  Don't take my word for it.  Google the issue, and you'll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers.  From now on, I'll avoid Scansoft	neg

This puzzle (also known as Rubik's Revenge) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement, it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube. However, the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force! A clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will (very gently) snap into place.  A second clue: only the centre pieces (four flats pieces on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle, and your cube will be as good as new. Start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer. Remember! No force	neg
My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday.  She loves tub toys, but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water.

I'm a big fan of Sassy toys, but I'd pass  on this one	neg

I read the good Doctor's book Eat to Live and then bought China Study which he talks a lot about in this book.  Then I bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though I do feel he's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a Doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own.   ---  --- Being a vegetarian for more than 37 years I became an almost 100% vegan after reading Eat to Live and have to say that I feel great with more energy and even started reducing anti-depression med I've been taking for severe depression.  Yesterday I took my last pill! All week I've been emptying  my refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow.  And reducing my one cup  of coffee in the norning to none because I remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache, I'm going to do 10 days and hoping for 14.  I've done 3 day fast before and one 5 day and that was great.   ---  --- Yes, there are some flaws in both books and I wish the good Doctor would have made use of a good editor as it's not as professionally written as it could be and the recipes in Eat to Live are atrocious with too much canned foods and not healthy organic foods but I'll forgive him because he got me on The China Study which changed my life and his studies and own experience helping people get well are good and inspiring. ---  --- Why am I going on a 10 day detox water diet?  I read Randall Fitxgerald's One Hundred Year Lie and that was the catalyst that pulled it all together for me. A detox fast absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many years on anti-depressants ---  --- I'm keeping Dr. Fuhrman's Fasting book close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and encouragement.   ---  --- I did make the mistake of telling my coworkers that I was starting a 10 day fast though the good Doctor warned me not to.  The comments from them were typical I suppose knowing their health or lack of but I held my tongue.  Those comments are just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of Dr. Fuhnman's books make along with other nutrituion books. But I thinkof the wisest words," you are responsible for your own health" and think about my not being able to remember the last time I had a cold and the last flu I had in 1964 and smile.   ---  --- I don't intend to support the ill-begotten medical-pharmecutical industry. ---  --- The last time I went to the Dr. I promptly firedhim after his continued to badger me into getting manograms. and other tests,   I repeated that I eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do with breast cancer and I just walked out of his office forever. I'd rather read a book	pos
This item was fairly easy to assemble.  Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes.  It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well.  Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours.  The carrier held up well.  I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault.  It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes.  Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida	pos
Everything the negative reviewers say is true and MORE. Please note the following as well: --- 1. If you are a college student taking a class online that uses Blackboard software, Vista will prevent you from posting to the class discussion board and answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions on TESTS! To fix this download the FoxFire browser (free) and use it to access your course. Because Vista uses so much memory and is already so huge, they had to drop quite a few little programs that software needs to access in the Operating system. ---  --- 2. HUGE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE DRAIN.  --- Look at this comparison --- Windows XP Professional    Size on drive 1.5 gig    Memory requirements 128 MB ---  --- Windows Vista    Needs 15 GIG To Load. Does not say how large the program is but I wouldn't think its small!!! Memory requirements 1 GIG! ---  --- If you check the DELL website you will see that they recommend that you have 2 gig of memory to use Windows Vista. That is a few $$$ worth of memory just to run the operating system while openning a program. Try running a game or doing animation with that kind of a sink hole in your system! The less memory you have available, the slower everything, including websites will load (no matter how fast your internet connection)  ---  ---  What is worse is that to fix what is wrong with it (ie replace all those small programs your software expects to find in the operating system), they will have to ADD patches that can only make it bigger and hungrier for memory! ---  --- This is the most pathetic excuse for an upgrade that I have ever seen. I would expect some lawsuits before this is over! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT	neg

I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars!  Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007.  Too bad I bought it in December.  This is a piece of junk.  I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer.  (It was $12 at that time).  I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate.  I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time.  So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000?  I never knew.  The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000.  I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.  It will probably do better than this. 	neg

Now, I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say, this is my favorite racket I have used. I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more. It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so. For me, the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months. However, if you play at a less competitive level. They will break twice a year maybe.

After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.  ---  --- From its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.  ---  --- This movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.  ---  --- If you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.   ---  --- You sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- "Der Badenweiler". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets.... ---  --- Lastly, in my opinon, the commentary by "historian" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war.  The marching soliders and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience. Try to remember -- this movie was not made for YOU!	pos
Many of the columns were interesting . . . painting a picture of a vast right-ring conspiracy that Hillary Clinton first brought to the public discourse.  But it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete, without any interest either as themselves or as a theme.  Does anyone care about Texas state politics in 1989, or Phil Gramm's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate?  Someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete .. except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book.  Just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read	neg

It's a decent mic for just a few bucks.  It works adequately, and has an on/off switch, and an XLR connector. ---  --- It comes with a XLR-to-1/4 cord.  If you're going to plug this mic into a mixer, be sure to get a XLR-to-XLR cord.  The volume of the mic, when connected to a mono 1/4 jack with the included cable, was almost inaudible.  With a XLR-to-XLR cord, it was at normal volume levels compared with other equipment	pos
I was very excited to get this product.  It scans well, files well, is very sexy and promising.  Then I decided to Search for a few files based on my Keywords.  Oooops!  It won't search!! --- If you don't know already, PaperPort offers you only one free tech support call.  After that it's $20 a pop.  The rather surly technician I reached had me re-install my program.  Okay, but it still wouldn't search.  Then he told me to un-install Windows Service Pack 2.  Uh uh, no way.  Nada.

"No sweeteners" on the can, yet the first ingredient listed after carbonated water is "White grape juice concentrate", which might not be sucrose, but since when is that not sugar? Each small (8.4 oz) can has 170 calories and 41 carbs. I was so excited to find a healthy fun drink, but this is not it   ---  --- The flavor? A lot like Mountain Dew. Mostly sugar, yes there's some lemon in it, but it's hard to tell it's Meyer lemon as opposed to some other type.

I chose this railway set over Learning Curve because I believe their prices are inflated, and I was not disappointed with it.  The set is well made overall, with smooth, well-fitting track and sturdy accessories.  My son (3) and daughter (6) have played with the set for hours every day since we got it, both with equal fascination.  It fits perfectly with Thomas accessories we already own.  I have only three small caveats:  1) Buy some "sure track" clips to use on elevated portions of the track.  We use it on a smooth, level surface (hardwood floor), but the clips really enhance the stability for active play.  2)  The round turntable did not spin freely when we got it, because the blue center piece was not perfectly round.  We drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece, sanded down the edges, and replaced it.  Now it's very easy for my kids to operate.  3)  The trains included have slightly wobbly wheels, compared to Thomas trains.  But they are functional, and my kids use the trains interchangeably.  It's a great set, and a real bargain	pos
I have taught photography at the college level, shoot 4x5 view camera work on occasion, and am very demanding about image quality.   I am quite satisfied with the image quality from my Kodak P880, particularly after I installed the newest firmware upgrade available from Kodak. ---  --- I went through several 7MP to 8 MP cameras before finally getting the Kodak P880.  The P880 has better image quality than some high end Sonys and Olympus 7-8 MP cameras like the DSC-V3 or the SP350.  I tested the P880 against the even higher end 10.3 MP large sensor Sony R1 and the difference in image quality in a 13x19 print between the P880 and the R1 was barely perceptible after minor sharpening and noise reduction, which the P880 images accept particularly well.   The zoom lens has a very useful range and is generally pretty sharp throughout its range.   Balance, manual controls and features feel high end and adequate for most semi-professional needs.   The camera is a little slow processing and storing pictures in RAW format and exposure bracketing modes but that really doesn't bother me because I do mostly landscape and fine art photos.   RAW file format is directly supported by most versions of Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements as well as most other RAW processing programs like Bibble Pro.  Unlike most sub-$500 cameras, the P880 uses regular screw in haze and polarizing filters, a real plus and it has a highly controllable hot shoe.   Manual focus is usable and manual exposure control works well.   The direct mechanical zoom is also nice. ---  --- Overall, the P880 is a digital camera that can either be a high end point and shoot SLR-styled camera or one that can be used as fully manually as the most classic 35 mm film SLR.    ---  --- Although not small enough to slip in a pocket, the size is still reasonable and light	pos
I started writing code for the web back when you could still order it as a text only service.  DOS ruled the day, and there were no ads plastered on every site.  This is the first product that takes HUGE STEPS BACKWARD in useability, functionality, and performance since the public birth of the web.  Unlike the previous reviewers glowing account of AS 4000 I am looking at new software because the service that this company provides and their complete lack of a proactive nature with regard to its useability have rankled me one too many times.  To wit: ---  --- 1.  I am running a dual core 3.0 with 1 gb of memory and the 3d draw is slower that previous versions. --- 2.  Tech support had the audacity to tell me that going to a drop down menu to rotate an item selected is faster than a right click of the mouse and a context menu that would allow me to do the same from that menu.  This is a step backward of at least 10 years.  Previous versions had the right click menu which also had delete and other frequently used commands available.  Really piss poor on their part to eliminate this feature alone. --- 3.  Despite a fast newer machine, once you select an item you have to wait before you can move it by selecting it a second time.  Pitiful. --- 4.  Won't import standard dxf files without saving them as one layer.  Making a product that won't play nice with others is a bad thing. ---  --- I have other issues, but just don't want to spend any more time on this company or their products.  If I ran my business and failed to listen to my customers like punch, I would be out of business. ---  --- Bottom line:  NO LONGER RECOMMENDE	neg
In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily.  It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise.  This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable.  My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended.  I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	neg
lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color	pos
I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message.  "Home" is just plain fun.  "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful. ---  --- However, I must say that the Four Songs version of "Orange Sky" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written.  However, the Time Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original).  The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the Four Songs version does.  I will always be baffled by this remake.  It is truly awful.  Its only saving grace is that the original is still available. ---  --- But that is by no means any reason to avoid this CD.  In fact, those who do not know the original "Orange Sky" may fall in love with this one.  But it is my duty to warn those looking for an "Orange Sky" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed.  Outside of this single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own	pos

Final Fantasy is sometimes thought of as a kiddy game with chocobos and moogles. Final Fantasy XII proves that this series can present an awesome storyline and graphics that all ages will adore. ---  --- Don't worry if you haven't played all of the other Final Fantasy games. You don't need to. There are subtle carry-overs, but this game is meant to stand alone. You are a young orphan in a city recovering after a war. The cruel Empire has taken over your home town, and you enjoy causing trouble for the soldiers. ---  --- Soon, of course, you're swept up in an epic rebellion. The storyline here is just *amazing*. Not just the plot itself, but the voice acting, the dialogue, the graphics, they are top notch. This is really like being a part of an extremely well done drama movie. They delve into issues of honor, loyalty, love, betrayal, and more. I'm an adult gamer, and I was staying up many long nights because I wanted to see where the story was going. Some of the subtle interactions between characters in cut scenes are just amazing. The small nods, the looks in their eyes, you are hard pressed to remember that they are animated in a computer game. ---  --- Gameplay itself revolves around a party of characters going on quests, fighting in battles and moving through the large world. Each character gains experience and skills as they go. You buy them new weapons and armor, train them in spells, and aim them in their career growth however you wish. There is a dual system in play here. First, you need to physically own the weapon or item you wish to use - say an iron sword. But then you need to KNOW how to use it too! You can't just hand an iron sword to a 10 year old piano player and expect her to know how to use it. That skill is called a "license". You have an online license chart that lets you manage what each character knows. Licenses relate to each other. If your character learns the basics of sword work, now they can learn a more advanced version. It is very intuitive and adds a fun element to the game. It's not just one straight line that you choose and are stuck with. It's an all-directions layout where you can try new skills or expand out as you learn the system better. ---  --- I really like combat in this Final Fantasy as well. Instead of random battles where enemies appear out of nowhere to assault you, all enemies are "on the map" with you. If you're running along a path in the desert and see something really scary in the distance, you run away from it! You don't have to worry about enemies springing up out of nowhere to slam you into the ground. ---  --- The enemies in general are challenging but not impossible. There are spots where you really have to think about the enemy and what its weakness is to defeat it. You can't just brute force bash away at everything and hope to succeed. ---  --- Still, as great as the gameplay is, and as gorgeous as the visuals and music and voice acting are, I really have to come back to the plot and characters as standing out here. There's been a lot of talk in the gaming world about a game that finally goes from "little pixels on the screen" that you move from X to Y to the point of *caring* about these characters, about what they are going through, and feeling emotional about their highs and lows. I really think Final Fantasy XII has hit that level. Yes, there are one or two twerpy characters that can be annoying. Even Star Wars had Luke whining about the Takashi Station at the beginning, to set his "basis for growth". In general, though, every single character here seems real, seems complex, and you don't want to put the game down. ---  --- Highly, highly recommended	pos
I really want to like Thich Nhat Hanh's books. I want to because people I respect like them, because I believe in the value of mindful living... but the truth is that I didn't find this book very helpful. ---  --- I have real and continuing struggles with Anger and this book while interesting in a round about way is, as others have mentioned, not directed toward the problem of anger. It is a mindful living remix. ---  --- I'm going to keep searching for a great TNH book and when I do I'll recommend it. Good hunting	neg
If you don't have an overly complicated tax return I found that TaxCut is great to use.  The thing I like most is the interview.  Even if you don't think you qualify for what it is asking, say "yes".  It will ask more questions.  If indeed you don't qualify you have lost nothing and can proceed with the interview.  In tax year 2005 it uncovered something I had missed and I filed ammended returns for 2004 & 2005 and pocketed $300.  I also was excited about e-filing and direct deposit.  I filed in early February and had both my Federal and State refunds in my account in three weeks.  It comes with Deduction Pro which makes keeping track of things very simple and it all imports for next year. ---  --- Amazon had the best price at $49 and free shipping for the February timeframe	pos

We have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science, math, and technological education for everyone. The first one occurred after the Sputnik fiasco, when the Russians beat us in the race to reach space. The  concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, and educators saw in comparison  of assessments made of students in the U.S. and those in other developed  countries, such as Japan. The answer to this concern was for the AAAS along  with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific  literacy, and what the public in the U.S. should at least know to be  scientifically literate. As usual, though the AAAS addressed the fact that  certain groups in the U.S. were not being 'included' in the pursuit of  science literacy, such as women and racial minorities, in this their first  book they skipped over those of us with disabilities. Since this is a major  concern of mine and the area in which I do research, I was appalled to see  they neglected 'us' once again, especially as the AAAS has a separate  department dealing with the Disabled/Deaf.  In spite of this mistake, the  writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges  as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that  our country can be more scientifically literate. With new information being  made available through newspapers and the Internet on a daily basis, it is  absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race, gender, or  ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of  information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care,  decisions on employment (since health care is one of the top employers in  the U.S. today), and to teach their children. This book was the beginning,  but it isn't the end. More books have further elucidated what is required  for science literacy from both the AAAS and other science groups. This is  the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their  students to become scientifically literate.

Yes the coffee is the best quality, pesticide free.  There are technical issues with the pods. 1 pod was broken when I opened up the pouch it was stored in.  For any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable.  Also, many times the pod is not working, but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work (I have Black & Decker Home Cafe Machine).  Great coffee, but I felt that I had to really work for it.  I also feel that to charage $15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive, considering that they are being shiped from LA not HI	pos

I received this swing as a gift. I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing.  My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc.  In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me. ---  --- What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on.  But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing	neg

These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.

I purchased this expansion set, along with the Thomas and Friends Water Towr Figure 8 Set, for my 2 year old this past Christmas. The expansion set was an afterthought, prompted in no small part by the manufacturer's promotion running at the time (50% off this set with the purchase of a Figure 8 set). ---  --- With the conclusion of many initial hours of intense playtesting (an ongoing process, with no termination in sight), my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any but the most basic (read: boring) wooden railroad layout. This expansion pack comes with switch tracks, and allows little train engineers (and their dads) to reverse directions or explore different parts of the railway. In retrospect, I think that I would have been dissatisfied had I not purchased this set to complement the basic Figure 8 layout, promotional price or not. ---  --- As far as the quality, the Learning Curve wooden track is made from hardwood, and is more substantial than many other brands of compatible track (i.e. Maxim, First Learning, etc.). This is a consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart by him/herself to put away. We have already broken a couple of pieces of generic track this way, since the male end of the connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track. ---  --- Overall, we are quite satisfied with this set, and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment	pos

"When was the last time you actually bought a ticket to see a movie, you actually paid your own money to see it?" --- "Last night, Pasedena. The Bicycle Thief." --- "It's an art movie. It doesn't count. We're talking about movie movies." ---  --- Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors, mainly for the way he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases. This short exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more when taken in context. With this dialog, The Player reveals exactly why Hollywood movies don't make the money they should. Not because they don't make quality films, but because when a good movie does make money, it doesn't count because it's not a "movie movie." If he stopped to really listen to what was being said, he would've seen that art films have a great drawing power and actually don't cost much to make. But people still wonder why the modern film industry is suffering. ---  --- Wait, there's more. The people in the room don't know it, but producer Griffin Mill, in a fit of paranoia, killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the theater that night. He was being stalked by a writer, but he blamed (and murdered) the wrong one. Now he's still being stalked, still in danger of losing his job, and the cops suspect him of murder. Not a good week for Mister Mill. ---  --- As the conversation presses on, Mill's potential replacement passes around a newspaper, telling people to read random headlines to be made into scripts. Mill spots the story on his murder which we're already watching play out in a movie. ---  --- Yes, it's that type of movie, the self-referential Hollywood movie about Hollywood movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers' enjoyment. We've seen it about a thousand times before (or since): Get Shorty, Adaptation, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, even certain elements of 8 1/2. There's really nothing too special about it, but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable. Pay close attention to the ending scene, and think about what words they're using opposed to what they're really saying. ---  --- There's really only one word for a film like this: "Clever!	pos

This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life.  To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes.

This is perhaps the best of the Final Fantasy games, and sadly, the most under-appreciated. IX had amazing animation and backgrounds, a beautiful music score, and solid gameplay. The characters are some of the most delightful in the series. Personally, I think Vivi and Zidane are the coolest characters ever. Lastly, the  gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline.  --- On a sidenote, This game definitely deserves a remake. There's a lot of hype about final fantasy VII, its own prequel and a remake coming for PS3. I feel that Final Fantasy IX should be remade on the PS3. I love the story line better than VII, the graphics were way better, and the gameplay was incredible	pos
What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: --- A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .  ---  --- What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   --- A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again! ---  --- If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER. ---  --- Did I mention no Denise Richards?	neg

When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it	pos

I first had this tea served at the Firebird Resturant in New York. They served it in traditional Russian tea glasses with sweetened cherries from Moldavia (no sugar).

I have several Fossil watches, and every time I needed to adjust the band, it cost me around $10 - $15. I found this tool and figured it was worth a try. I was able to remove links from 2 of my Fossil watches, though my newest Fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool.  ---  I even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends.It worked well, made the adjustments and they were very happy with it! they plan to buy it for themselves! ---  you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin, but beyond that, it works like a dream	pos
As a dad, I was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old. This book is lousy though. Why? ---  --- 1. Stupid Writing. I got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy, "witty" remarks. "Dancing the Potty Mambo"? Give me a break! ---  --- 2. Stupid Advice. This book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he/she is an adult. I'm sorry, but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or don't want them to do something. How about just saying, "Don't do that!" or "Hey, you want to try this?" That seems to work just fine for me. Why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something? What's wrong with just telling your kid what to do (nicely), and expecting them to be obedient?  ---  --- 3. Repeating Content. This book kept repeating itself OVER and OVER. Okay, I got it already! I strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages (or less). ---  --- 4. Too Many References. This book constantly refers to other chapters. I once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page. I am not kidding! Huh? Is potty training really that freakin' complicated? All I want is some general ideas on how to go about it, how to get started, and a few good tips. I don't need all these detailed references. (Nor do I need the phrase "Potty Mambo" repeated to me ad infinitum.) ---  --- Here is all I wanted to know: --- -How do I get started? --- -What do I do? --- -How often do I need to try it? --- -Should I go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment? ---  --- Maybe this book got to all of that, but I quit after page 60. I just couldn't take it anymore. After hearing the phrases "Stay Positive" and "Potty Mambo" repeated to me for the umpteenth time, I had to quit. I returned this book and got my money back. ---  --- If I were to say anything good about this book, I would say that it has a few good tips, surrounded by about 180 pages of filler. ---  --- Potty training still looms ahead. Will I be successful? Probably. But to this book I say, No Thanks	neg

This just arrived Thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far. I am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so I won't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls, etc. ---  --- I agree closely with the other two reviews so I won't repeat their details. I'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the HC7 to the Sony HC90, an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 MP stills. ---  --- I have taken about one hour of HD video so far, and have viewed it through an HDMI cable on a Sony 46" XBR LCD TV (1080p). I captured a few indoor scenes, a few neighborhood outdoor scenes, and some footage at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia - river, mountain, and two trains passing by at close range while I was at the railroad station there. I can say comfortably that you won't confuse the video from this camcorder with Standard Definition camcorder video - when they say High Definition, they aren't kidding.  If your TV can show the video off to advantage and you've grown fond of HD, I think you'd be pleased with this camcorder.  In my case, the overwhelming reason I upgraded camcorders was to get the HD video, so this has made it worth the steep expense. My second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so I only have to carry one piece of equipment around. I already had this in the Sony HC90 at 3MP, so going up to 6MP was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself. ---  --- My only output criticisms so far are that the West Virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than I remember. I didn't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt. These camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which I have not explored. One or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage, and I'm not unhappy with what I think I noticed in the slightest. ---  --- The stills look very good to me so far, but I've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the TV. I normally view stills on a PC. ---  --- I don't have a telephoto lens yet so I can't report on the quality of the stabilization. I used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video.  I was very pleased, by the way, with how well the camera did with the moving trains. Very crisp where I expected a fair bit of motion blur. ---  --- LCD size and controls have been mentioned in First Looks. I'm perfectly happy with a 2.7" LCD instead of the larger one in the UX7. So this wasn't a negative for me personally. The controls (menus) are highly similar to those of the Sony HC90 I already have. If you haven't seen them before, there's a learning curve. If you have the HC90 or another camcorder with those menus, you'll be right at home with the HC7. One note: you can configure P[ersonal]-Menus to include the things you use the most in your own order, in addition to the camcorder's menus. One thing I forgot is that each mode (video, camera, play/edit) has its own configurable personal menu. So I was looking for things to add to the Play/Edit personal menu that I was sure should be configurable, but couldn't find them. That was because they belonged only to the filming side, not to the playback side. So you've got three personal menus you can create, not one. ---  --- Battery: check the sizes on the batteries. The HC90 batteries were very thin. I think three of the batteries for the HC7 fit entirely within its case. The fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that I thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1/2" or so. The other three will fit flush into the back of the camera, though they're not behind a door or anything. ---  --- Battery life: my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate, but the batteries drain faster than that of the HC90. This is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones.  The CCDs and the stills and everything are all "more" than in the HC90. So I think I'm fine with the battery life, but you'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery. ---  --- Size compared to the HC90: this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the HC90. It's maybe 1/2" longer front to back, and wider as well. I think the HC7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder I see in Best Buy. But it's noticeably smaller than last year's SR1 Sony hard disk camcorder, say. I don't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like I did with the HC90, but it's pretty light and still fits in the case I used for the HC90 if I don't load other stuff in there. ---  --- Fit in the hand: I found a Best Buy with an HC5 and UX5 on hand and played with both at the same time. These have the same footprint as the HC7 and UX7 as far as I can tell. The HC5's tape case is maybe 3/8" wider than the UX5's DVD case.  The UX5's DVD case is maybe 1/4" higher. So I found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller UX5 and it felt slightly more comfortable. However, I found that the HC5's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb. As I played with this in the store, I realized it seemed like the HC5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this. Absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you. Just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level. ---  --- Tape vs DVD (really HDV vs AVCHD): I spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year's AVCHD UX camcorders would still be present, and if I would care in any case. The detailed reviews still aren't out, so I don't know whether there will be a noise problem there. But I can say I noticed nothing in the footage so far that I'd call noise, so my decision to go with the tape and HDV format looks very good to me right now. I have never had the problems people report with Mini-DV tapes, so that whole transport discussion (tape vs DVD) didn't weigh on me much. The noise discussion did have an effect on my decision, though. ---  --- Getting the video to your TV: "how much money do we have?", apparently. I played the tape back to the TV directly, but that's not a long-term solution. I have heard that you can capture the HDV video and then will be able to transform it on a PC to formats suitable for Blu-Ray or HDV burners, if you have the money. Then you need a Blu-Ray or HDV player attached to your TV. For now, it sounds like many people are archiving the HDV video to DVDs as data files. Then they burn playable DVDs where the HD is down-converted to standard definition video.  So they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce HD versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop.  One other HC7 reviewer also implied that HD files captured by Ulead software could be moved to a PS3 hard drive and played back to an HD TV from there. So far, the easy and cheap path we have for SD video to DVDs to TVs is not quite there for HD based on what I've read.  ---  --- The one extra feature I wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20X optical zoom. I'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively, so I "understand". But that would be #1 on my wish list. ---  --- Overall, I am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now.  I know we're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago.  But it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around, take some video, and then have play it back on a high-quality HD TV looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment. I know better intellectually, but it's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new TVs so beautifully.      --- 	pos
I am not a spring chicken, so I get introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives.	pos
More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five	neg
I agree that this magazine boasts designer clothing with extremely high prices that most people cannot afford, but may people be aware that this magazine is called "Teen Vogue" and obviously will follow in it's big sister's footsteps.  --- "Vogue" does not feature clothes from Walmart, and so "Teen Vogue" will not either. --- This magazine does not necessarily cater to only rich people. who says that a person should only buy a magazine when she is going to get the exact clothes featured in it? I am definitely no millionaire. I'm 16 years old and still in High school, but I enjoy this magazine immensely.Of course I dont slip out to Marc Jacobs when i'm done reading and get myself the shirt on page 79, but I do look at the styles so i can understand the new trends and just inspire myself some. magazines dont always have to be realistic. fashion is about pursuing beauty and covetting beauty, and if all magazines only featured "affordable clothes' from Walmart and Old Navy, well.. I really wouldnt know what that would be like. --- "Teen Vogue" is a pure fashion magazine. it isnt an all-round magazine for young girls. it's only fashion. and it does a great job at what it strives for. the fashion is great and the taste is great, the shoots are amazing. a former reviewer reccomended "Seventeen" and I want to note that "Seventeen" is a different type of magazine entirely. Seventeen is extremely mainstream bubblegum and is not very fashion orientated. personally i do not like that magazine but i'm not going to condemn it here.  --- "Teen Vogue" is classy, stylish, and lives up to it's name. you dont have to be a rich kid to read this magazine. but it's the only teen magazine out there which is dedicated souly to high fashion and yes, features the best fashion.  people who are not interested in fashion will probably hate this magazine, and that is probably why it has recieved so much criticism. I, on the other hand, love this magazine. the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the reviews above deemed the stuff in it affordable for young girls and that does strike me as ridiculous. --- otherwise, look to this magazine for some fantastic fashion inspiration	pos

This is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves, my 2nd pair of this exact Speedo Aqua Fitness Glove.  Allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit.  With other gloves, water builds up inside the glove and, if lycra-backed for example, the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while. ---  --- These Speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes. ---  --- In addition, the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves I have had. The palms hold up well as do the backs. ---  --- I recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises	pos

If you love Ludlum's over-the-top novels (and I do), The Matarese Circle has to be up there with the best. Not all of Ludlum's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated "Oh my God!" declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on aren't as riveting as they could be (the two Bourne sequels suffer from this problem, I think.) But Circle delivers on all fronts. Part One is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between Talienkov and Scofield plays out thrillingly. And these are two of Ludlum's most believably drawn characters; we feel empathy for both, and root for them to join forces from the get-go. Antonia Gravet, the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in Part Two, brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot. One final bonus: some of Ludlum's zestiest minor characters appear in this book, adding to the fun in nearly every chapter.	pos

Xenosaga: Episode 3 (Also sprach Zarathustra) brings back the magic of Episode 1 and fixes the vast majority of the problems that occurred in Episode 2.  The story here, as rich and complex as ever, is brought to an appropriate and moving close as Shion and company battle to uncover a deep-seated conspiracy unlike anything else they've ever encountered.  The fabric of the story itself, the voice acting, and the cutscenes are all truly superb - it's remarkable that the makers at Namco/Bandai managed to pull all of the loose ends together to make the story finally make sense.  To boot, it's a pleasure to watch and listen to -- who could ask for more? ---  --- As for the battle system, it finally regains its fun in Episode 3.  I simply wasn't a fan of Episode 2's system, so the return to "basics" was a blessing in my mind.  The characters still do battle in their unique ways, as each has his/her own customizable skills to obtain, but long gone are the days of ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies.  Here, in both ground and E.S. (mech) battles, your ability to strengthen and customize your party shines through and you are always rewarded for your hard work.  Replay value is moderate-to-high as well, since your party consists of all the familiar players for most of the game; if you have a habit of using the same three or four people (like me; yay for chaos!), you can always play through again with a different group. ---  --- Shops return in this Episode, making buying and selling your merchandise once again possible.  The only thing lacking is this game is a little more in the "extras/side quests" department, of which this game only offers a handful.  While some of these take longer than others, a few more side quests would have been nice, particularly since this is the last in the series. ---  --- I can't rave enough about how impressed I was with this title.  It rivals Episode 1 in every way possible, and the trilogy's epic story outstrips other RPG competition without question.  If you're looking for fun battles, a fantastic story, and beautiful graphics, then look no further; Xenosaga: Episode 3 is for you.   ---  --- I can only hope that someone changes their mind and decides to make another one -- after this exceptional closing Episode, it's hard not to wish for another game to come along in the future.  Very highly recommended. ---  --- Summary: --- Story: A+ --- Cutscenes: A --- Graphics/Rendering: A --- Battle/Skill System: A --- Extras/Side Quests: A- --- Replay Value: Moderate-to-Hig	pos

New to Thai cuisine, I asked to try a milder curry, my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat. Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again. ---  --- So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications. ---  --- I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting. ---  --- This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator. ---  --- The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl. ---  --- I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste. ---  --- For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.  ---  --- Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325). ---  --- The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation	pos

After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice.  I was VERY wrong.  When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated.  I thought it was great.  I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe.  Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open... and kept popping open with every change.  THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in... my $700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped! ( I had it replaced!!)   I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table, too.  Same problems kept happening. So I called Combi...Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging.  She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging.  Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS!  Even if it did hold the CUPS of water.. so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes,  it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it???? And although it is stated... a) there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b) WHY!  I bought a large "bag" of Huggies wipes.. there is no package to pop in. --- Second... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time.. and that this too, is in the Manual.  So I lookeed at that, too.  Not in the "Usage" part.. but on the back under "Cautions" it states this:  "Unplug power cord when not in use".  Okay.... when you have a newborn.. when are you NOT using your wipes.. LOL!  She said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm!!!  I guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that! AND... if that was an acceptable property of the product.. shouldn't there be a switch??  I would have to move the dresser every time.. or get an extention cord, of course!  Crazy!  --- Combi gave me, what I consider, ridiculous answers.  They also need to get real when they write the Manual.   --- For the record.. I have written a review one other time to rave about my Little Bissell.  This frustrated me so much I HAD to share the info.!!!!!!  Also.. this is baby #4 so I am quite familiar with baby products. 	neg
This was the first karaoke revolution game that I received, and I enjoy it very much! However, the songs on the game I found were quite old, even for someone like myself, a senior in college. I dont know about the rest of you, but the 80's were a blur for me. I didnt know these songs very well, which can put a major hinderance on game play. I liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game, but I have already ordered Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that I would know. ---  --- I found the "sing and dance" mode to be challenging, and if you dont know the song by heart, dont play it, because you need to be watching the arrows for where your feet should be going. I would also recommend a wireless microphone for the dance pad (if they exist) since a cord will get in the way of your dancing moves. ---  --- I thought it was really cool that the game had a sense of initiative, with over 50 different unlockable items (although 90% of which are items you can use to create your character, or just a new character). Some of the songs listed here need to be unlocked through game play. I'm sorry I couldnt think of every artist for these songs, but if it isnt listed, assume its from at least 15 years ago. ---  --- 1. (I've Had) the Time of My Life --- 2.

I wear this watch every day and I usually work outside. I am very pleased with the features and the durability. It seemed daunting to work the features at forst, but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy. ---  --- I have only two complaints: One is that the metal band has developed a slight "squeak" when I move my wrist sometimes. The tin man needs oil. The second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night, the watch does not always get the time signal from Ft. Collins. I have gone as long as several days without getting it - but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all, I am OK with the spotty reception	pos
Okay, it's funky in looks - but the closest I came to an equivalent was 2.5X times the price with a LOT less features.

I've got an iPod and loads of headphones - these are actually a GOOD set of (stereo) headphones well worth the price of the unit itself.  It comes with its own battery - no disappoint-ment for a giftee!  But the other cool trick is that you can hook it and its "effects" back through to an instrument amp with an extra cable -  How Fun Is That? - VERY	pos
Don't hesitate to buy this grill!!!!   ---  --- For the past few years I've been switching back and forth between my gas grill and my good ole Weber kettle grill.  Like everyone else I prefer grilling over charcoal, so this seemed like the perfect grill for me...   ---  --- I was right! ---  --- This grill takes all the pain away from grilling with charcoal.  One push of a button and 15 minutes later I am grilling ribeyes.  YES!  It is that simple.  The chimney revolutionized how I grilled with charcoal, but this is 10 times better than that. ---  --- The propane ignition rocks, the work area is great, the lid holder is a nice addition, and the water proof charcoal holder is more convenient than I thought it would be.  Let us not forget it has a dual purpose thermometer! ---  --- It took me about 40 minutes to assemble, but that's to be expected. ---  --- Oh yeah, I ordered it on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday.	pos
A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out. ---  --- It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird. ---  --- Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes	neg

This is the one I buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office. It is like the one I bought 5 years ago with my first baby, the one that is still humming along. ---  --- I have been really happy with our thermometer with the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my second child, a boy who persists in having 'tiny' ear canals even though he is three now. It has worked well for every other kid I know though. ---  --- About the variation in temperature taking. My advice is to practice taking your and your children's temperature while you and they are healthy. For one thing, not everyone has the `standard' 98.6 degree normal temperature; and for another thing it isn't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right direction once it is in the ear canal. It takes practice. ---  --- A good home purchase. (For really little babies we used a pacifier thermometer with great success.	pos

I was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when I got this soap,  but sadly, that's not what happened.  The smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an Italian pasta dish.   Not very appealing!  There is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  On the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  If you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.   ---  --- It just wasn't for me.	neg

Love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! Well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. I added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. So, some people love it. I don't get it. And, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. I pointed this out in my review.

Until I bought several weeks worth of Rayovac Alkaline D cells, I used Duracell Alkaline D cells.   ---  --- Every week I run a 3-CD changer (JVC _CX-XC370) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes, at the same volume level (Volume #10), from Tuesday to Thursday.  The Duracells lasted all 11 hours (and might last even longer).  In contrast, these Rayovac D cells for the last three weeks (maybe four weeks) have consistently  died during the second half of the next-to-last class (after hour 9.5 and before hour 10).	neg
What a disappointment! I absolutely loved The Black Pearl but was admittedly  nervous about a sequel. As it turned out, I had every reason to be. It whole purpose of this movie seemed to be to return those characters from the original, major or minor, who seemed interesting. That they did but, unfortunately, the producers forget to give them a credible plot and interesting things to say. ---  --- Depp seemed to play his role even campier than before while Keira must have, somehow, pissed off the writers so that they refused to give her any real meaty part of this movie. Legolas, I mean, Orlando Bloom also seemed to be sort of drifting along, sometimes good but more often, haphazardly. To my mind, the only real interesting addition was that of Davey Jones. Except for times when it was hard to understand what he was saying (due to the tentacles 'n all), at least his was a unique addition to the movie. I do sort of object, however, to associating him with the Flying Dutchman legend. The two have nothing to do with each other, fantasy or not. And don't get me started on the cannibals! ---  --- Any way, I think this movie merits the two y'ars I gave it. While considerably beneath that first movie, it is somewhat watchable and even enjoyable at times, but it is most definitely not as good. ---  --- And, as a final thought, the very last scene of the movie? Lose it entirely. It simply was unnecessary. --- 	neg
I read Scientific American occassionally back in the 80's. At that time I found the articles (especially the physics articles, which I love) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics. The quality was there but it didn't quite get across to my younger self.  ---  --- Now, I find the text to be very good and superbly well-supported by side matter and graphics. I would call this an improvement (both in the magazine and, perhaps, in myself). ---  --- However, I didn't read it regularly back then, so perhaps the negative reviewers are correct in saying the magazine has been "dumbed down". If so, then it was from a very lofty level as the articles continue to require a reasonable background in their subject areas. For example, the article "Computing with Quantum Knots" was just right for somebody who has read a number of non-mathematical treatments of this topic and who, like me, has read parts of the Feynman lectures and things of that nature. It was a sophisticated and intelligent article. There are many more examples I could give. ---  --- My only gripe with Scientific American (and this has been true for decades) is that I just don't like medical articles and the magazine regulary has them. This, however, is a personal matter and reflects my interests not the quality of the magazine.  ---  --- I strongly suspect the "format was changed", as some said, because the publisher wanted to improve it for everybody and catch a few more readers. Certainly, I would not have subscribed to the old Scientific American. It was too dense and too boring. Now it is just about right for me. ---  --- But that's me. Your mileage may vary	pos
These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format.  The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places.  MORE IMPORTANT,  this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading.  The list price for these books is 17.95.  Check in any book store.  Shame on the seller	neg

I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants. ---  --- Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them. ---  --- Sorry, Land's End; I'll try LL Bean next time	neg
When it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if I was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher.

I was very disappointed with this film.  It definitely had a more "art house" feel to it than I was expecting - and like happens with many art house films Sebastiane is light on plot and character development and heavy on scenery shots, bad string music and slow motion nude shots (but, alas, not even erotic ones).   ---  --- The real story of Sebastiane is a fascinating one.  How does such a man transform into the much beloved St. Sebastiane of the Catholic church?   Well, don't expect this movie to tell you.  There is, as mentioned above, no character development.  We are given an off-handed explanation that Sebastiane's faith (Christianity) was the cause of his eventual execution - but any scenes of faith are oddly intertwined with a lot of Roman flavored philosophical ideas - references to Roman gods and so forth.  Very un-Catholic.  So while we know that it was Sebastiane's faith that lead to his execution, this "plot line" is really dulled down, to the point that there is no plot. ---  --- The other men on the island are nothing more than pretty bodies to look at, their characters do not get developed at all.  (the interaction/conflict between Sebastiane and the Roman guard could have been so much more interesting and potent if Jarman had fleshed out that character a little more) ---  --- Also, disappointing was that the eroticism of this film falls miserably flat.  Now I realize that I am a female and this is a gay movie, but I would like to think that I am as aroused by sexy, nude men as much as any gay man would be.  Well, I was not aroused.   There are plenty of shots of nude men, but the way that Jarman shot the film is so stylized and stiff, that it takes all the eroticism out of it.  I watched a slow motion scene of two nude men splashing in the surf and all I could think was "gay men are actually turned on by this??!" ---  --- Well this straight woman was bored about half-way through the movie.  So my advice is don't buy this movie for it's story line or it's erotic value - there is none of either. --- 	neg

I read the various reviews about the movie "The Hunter".  I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.  Much like owning a Fiero,  . . . . which I do. ---  --- The movie, as is the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's.  However, he still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability.  When you take the character, "Papa" Thorson,  he was a different breed in the wrong time era.  Who else, but McQueen could make him so realistic? ---  --- I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been wanting a copy to add to my library.  I intend to do that today. ---  --- Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero?  I have found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish they had never laid eyes on it.  I loved "The Hunter" and I love my Fiero.  For those of you who don't understand, . . . "sorry"!  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill.   God bless you, Steve and thank you for the entertainment you gave us	pos

I suggest that you do a search on this product on infomercial scams dot com. ---  --- Take a look at this review from Channel 2 (KDKA) in Pittsburgh, PA: ---  --- You've probably seen the ad on TV for auto cool - it's supposed to keep your parked car cooler. ---  --- But does it really do that?  ---  --- Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to keep your parked car cool? ---  --- Diane Black knows all too well the misery of climbing into a hot car.  ---  --- "I am a visiting nurse. I'm in and out of the car all day," Black said. "I hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. So I thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing." ---  --- After shipping and handling, $23 for Auto Cool as seen on TV.  ---  --- The same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car.  ---  --- But does it really do that? ---  --- On a hot day last week, we decided to find out. Inside the Auto Cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping. ---  --- The only thing you need is a pair of scissors. ---  --- Now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun. ---  --- We choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches. ---  --- The solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. No problem there. We hang it on the window, fan side in. ---  --- Next comes the weather stripping. ---  --- So we've installed Auto Cool. Now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees. ---  --- While we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction. ---  --- One hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car. ---  --- We are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. It just got hotter inside.  ---  --- But just to be fair, we test one more car. ---  --- We make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. This time, it's 80 degrees. ---  --- We quickly install auto cool. By now, the temperature is 90 degrees.  ---  --- While Diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. She says it will take about 20 minutes.  ---  --- In the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car. ---  --- Will it work this time?  ---  --- Twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees. ---  --- Maybe if we hadn't used Auto Cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care.  ---  --- Not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far. ---  --- Don't waste your money on this one. 	neg

If you are looking for more opinion than straight reporting and stats rather than highlights, TSN is your sports magazine. ---  --- Years back, TSN was seemingly slated to go the way of Sport magazine; one that couldn't find a niche in the Internet and cable era, which ultimately would spell its demise. It also took TSN to take a body blow from USA Today - when its Baseball Weekly cut into readership - and overhand rights by ESPN the Magazine to find its way. TSN is truly a survivor. ---  --- The in-season reporting is not based on editor's deciding what's hot. Those seeking out quick hits - for example - on auto racing don't have to wait for the Indy 500 or the NASCAR Chase for information.  ---  --- My biggest criticism is the reliance on lists - the best of, the worst of, etc. - that tend to become major stories when certain sports are ready to crank up for the year. Granted, many radio-talkers will pick up on the lists - and oftentimes give the compilers time to gab about it - but these features ultimately fall into a "lazy week" of gathering news. ---  --- Overall, though, TSN is better than ever and has a product that any sports fan would find informative.	pos
Many people, when they think of Buddhism, think of blissful meditation and serene contemplation. This movie graphically depicts the other side of Buddhism;i.e., hard work in the real world, in the real transformation of oneself and in one's efforts to help other beings, no matter how difficult or horrific the circumstances. --- The film concerns a Japanese soldier separated from his unit in Burma, at the very end of WW II and its immediate aftermath. As he journeys to find his unit in a POW camp, he is confronted, at every turn in this wasteland of war, with dead and unburied fellow Japanese soldiers. At first, he disguises himself as a Buddhist monk (knowing that the Burmese respect and feed their monks). When he comes across British hospital staff burying an unknown Japanese soldier, with a formal Christian burial service and great respect, he is transformed. He recalls the hundreds of dead and unburied Japanese soldiers he had seen in his journey, he becomes a true Buddhist monk, and makes a singular and difficult vow; he will not return to Japan until he has buried all of the corpses he had seen. So he goes back, and begins his work. --- Hardly blissful meditation, this. But he personifies what the Buddha taught; the purpose of Life is to be happy, but true happiness can only come from serving others. This soldier/monk, in devoting his life to active, difficult and gruesome work, is more a true fulfillment of the Buddha's teachings than is one who meditates on the weekend and wears prayer beads because it is "cool." --- Sorry to sermonize, but this movie is not only a wonderful work of cinema, it is a Buddhist teaching in itself. Compassion MUST be coupled with the very difficult work of serving others.	pos
you may be tempted to buy these because of the 'sony' name...but be warned, DO NOT buy sony cd-r's off of amazon....I bought this same 50 pack, and had to throw half, yes half as in 25 of the discs, out because they had read errors and God knows what else.

There are a great many gay themed films available today, but when Longtime Companion was released, it was but one of a small handful of films brave enough to paint gay characters with empathetic and intelligent brushstrokes - something that continues to beset filmmakers even today.  ---  --- Set during the late 70's and on into the 80's the film is a bare bones and ruthlessly truthful before-and-after portrait of the devastating effects of the AIDS virus on a small group of close friends/lovers and on the wider gay community. Very funny, extremely moving, occasionally upsetting, whether you are a gay viewer or not, this film is a courageous celebration of the strength and frailty of the human spirit.	pos
After watching "Harsh Times" we wondered "Is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life?" we couldn't believe what we were watching. It was meant to be the new 2006 version of "Training Day"--they even got Christian Bale to play the lead role--but only in the eyes of the people involved in it. It was a miscalculation and we'll explain why. ---  --- Brief Story: --- The movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of L.A. Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is a mentally unstable young Iraq War veteran. Now in the States, he is looking for a job as a cop. Jim's best friend Mike Alonzo (Freddy Rodríguez) is also unemployed, but when his friend comes to visit, they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities--selling drugs, guns, getting high just to name few. To spend time with his friend, Mike has to lie to his girlfriend Sylvia (Eva Longoria) making her believe that he is looking for a job. She doesn't know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face. ---  --- Review: --- "Harsh Times" has many problems, but the most notorious one is the crime "video game" feeling it has throughout the film. The characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a "Grand Theft Auto" or "Scarface: The World Is Yours" video game adaptation with a little bit of "Cheech & Chong" in the mix. There is no climax--we just see them driving to different places, arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end. Christian Bale's accent in this movie doesn't help either, not only it changes through out the film, but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate. The dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like--also there is no chemistry between them. The acting in this movie is disappointing, especially from Bale who we liked in movies like "American Psycho", "Batman Returns" and "The Prestige." It is clear that he was miscast this time. He just cannot do what Denzel Washington did in "Training Day." Because of his accent and terrible acting in this film, we believe this is his worst performance to date. This is something he doesn't want to add to his resume. ---  --- The Verdict: --- Christian Bale Returns, but this new American Psycho cannot find his Equilibrium. "Harsh Times" tries too hard to create the edgy, dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that "Training Day" had, but it doesn't even come close to achieve that goal. We laugh at the silliness of the story, overdramatic acting and Christian Bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year. He probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor. This is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent. --- 	neg

After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there's Selen'as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door. It was all too obvious that the original film wasn't taken into account when writing the sequel.  Not credible at all	neg
This clock is very simple and clean.  I had no problem getting mine to work.  I had to leave it overnight to get the signal and they all set.

My title says it all - I was really disappointed with this camera, but before I get into the specifics as to why, I must mention a few things first.  This was my third camera in the Exilim line - prior to purchasing Z850 I have owned Z60, as well as Z600.  Both were great cameras.  I mean, what's not to like?  Clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  But having to work for Kodak in the past, I decided that I want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that I needed something with a little more manual control, so I sold my Z600, and got a Z850 instead.  Big mistake!  I ordered it directly from Amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  Right of the bat I got a defective unit!  The problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  The shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  How is that for quality and reliability?!  But I thought to myself, "it's okay, it happens", so I returned it back to Amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from TechToysForLess (it was a lot cheaper comparing to Amazon).  One thing to be aware of - TechToysForLess sells what it's called "grey market" cameras.  I knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  For those who don't know what it is - the "grey market" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  Only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  Grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  Frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.   Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  So, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  BUT... In some instances, there could be minor differences between the "authorized" product, and the "grey market" one.  For example, a "grey" Z850 doesn't have an eBay mode, but offers an "Auction" mode instead.  It's a bit different with respect to settings.  Also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short "how to" instruction in various languages.  However, the full manual can be found on a CD-ROM.  Another difference, and that's actually a plus I think, is that it comes with a European power adapter, whereas American sold models don't have that.  The biggest concern with "grey market" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  I knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because TechToysForLess had a 10-day return policy, and I thought that it would be enough time for me to "explore" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  In any case, I placed an order, and three days later held a new Z850 in my hands.  I didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, I started taking shots left and right.  All of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so I knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one I had.  However, and I noticed it right away because I tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit "warm".  What I mean is there was a slight cast of "pink" present in all pictures.  You wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  Neither Z60, nor Z600 had that problem.  I still kept the camera though because I could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  What finally made me gave it up (I sold it on eBay), was the Casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a "broken" movie mode.  The original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with "stair stepping" - the movies were "jerky", and "noisy".  After numerous complaints by the customers, Casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1B that supposedly "fixed" the movie issue.  But what they in fact did was just "cripple" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1B, and the picture quality actually got worse!  Version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather "improved" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  Also, I've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  I didn't want to wait to find out, so I got rid off it. ---  --- I didn't do my usual Pros and Cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  For one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  A big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  Also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  Best Shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  It's a nice little camera.  Unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  I wish I could say that I enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun. ---  --- However, I still stand behind Casio products.  After I sold Z850, I got myself a P700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  It's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than Z750/Z850 models.  Excellent camera!  A true performer!  Built like a tank, has a sharp Canon lens, and made in Japan for a change! (all other Exilim models are made in China, which could be the reason for poor quality)  I've used P700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  Yep... Call me crazy, call me whatever you want - I just decided that I want even MORE manual control and flexibility, so I got myself Panasonic DMC-LX2.  One word - Wow!  What a camera!  Optical Image Stabilization, Wide Angle Leica Lens, RAW format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  I've had it only for 2 days now, but I'm already in love with it.  Don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  I didn't completely abandon Casio's though - my present to my wife for Valentine's Day this year - Casio EX-S770 in Red color.  I'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  Once again, I hope I've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.  Good luck	neg

Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this. --- I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.   --- I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started.... 	neg
As a huge fan of Pink Sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic, I was ecstatic to try out Chocolovers.  Since they don't sell Chocolovers anywhere near where I live I decided to order it from Sephora.com in the US.  First of all I thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if I might add), it cost me around $50 CDN.  I was so excited when my order came in today that I quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  Ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  I don't know what I had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what I got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a VERY strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  This may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as I am, I found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  Right now all I can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat Seven Up.  On the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  I think if I were trying to diet I would wear this scent everyday.  I think I will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because I really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  I am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  The bottom line is try before you buy	neg
This watch looks good but the movement is terrible. I got this watch as a Christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand. I must warn you, if you purchase this watch then don't be suprised if it doesn't work right. It may look like a Rolex but it doesn't work like one	neg
Recently I got into a more "grown up" field (commercial real estate) and decided I had to look the part.  I decided I needed a great watch to go with those new Brooks Brothers suits and got an Invicta Speedway.  At over a little more than a hundred bucks it was the greatest deal of my life.  I get compliments on it, especially from women, almost EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Several of my older colleagues mistook it for a Rolex Daytona and flipped when I told them the price.  I highly recommend it. ---  --- Furthormore,  I have found that INVICTA is an amazing watch company to say the least.  Around the same time I also bought the 8926 Pro Diver to use as my casual watch and also get endless compliments.  It is amazing that I got both of these watches for less money than a run of the mill Seiko or Citizen.  They will have have my money and compliments for years to come	pos
Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is much better than 99% of all films on TV or in the theatres.  the only reason it is unknown is its adult content - marijuana smoking and romantic affairs, lending amusing background to a woman's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life.  This is that rare bird, an intelligent film, for adults. My favorite line: Joe Mantegna's remark to Mia Farrow: "You're really interesting", after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible.  It is not a 5 star film, like say "Witness", but it is an excellent small film.  This is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	pos
I came to this film after rave reviews from friends, so perhaps I was expecting too much. There is much to admire here; the acting is top-notch, the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted, and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one. For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me. However, these are minor criticisms; it is a film I will watch again, and recommend to Japanese film fans, especially those who like the more slow-paced Japanese films such as Eureka, Moe no Suzaku and Sonatine	pos
This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality. I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together.  ---  --- Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer. The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.  ---  --- Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.  ---  --- I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.  ---  --- A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.  ---  --- For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review --- 	pos

The Epson R2400 is a purely Photo Printer. Be sure to understand this before you buy. So if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it  . . . think again. The K3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to Epson and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White printing quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my Epson R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. The biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the ink online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk ink tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 Inks will be imitated. IF you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. However at $850 I fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. I haven't been happy with this printer and I plan to replace it soon. Amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.	neg

I discovered the AM some 2 or 3 years ago. Since then, I have become an addicted reader to it. More than to any other magazine at the moment. ---  --- Let's start saying what the AM is not: is not about news, is not about business, is not about nice and colored pictures. ---  --- The AM has two main focuses. One is current affairs, with a special focus on the macro conditions of the US (mainly economy and politics) and international affairs. The other one is the arts, with a special focus in reviewing high-quality (and sometimes rare) books. ---  --- I like the AM for its focus in current affairs. In this monthly you will read long articles about issues like, to cite some examples that come to mind: --- - Simulation of a principals meeting to discuss alternatives to engage with North Korea --- - War game of an attack to Iran --- - Presidential candidates, their lives and their campaign strategies --- - State of affairs of the American educational system --- - Potential causes of an eventual economic crisis in the US ---  --- The AM sits in the same "hall of fame" as The Economist and Foreign Affairs. The main differences are that The Economist has a relatively short time frame and thus focuses on the news of the week and what they mean for the mid term. Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, is more scholarly in nature. The AM sits somehow in the middle. It is written mainly by senior journalists (so it's less scholarly) and its monthly focus allows it to disentangle itself from the relative "sameness" of every week's news. The AM goes beyond the "futility" of news reporting but stops before it gets into the "boringness" of scholarly writing. ---  --- If you want to enrich your view of the world with a quality monthly, if you are open-minded and are willing to read new points of view, if you want to get closer to the real issues behind foreign and economic policy, the AM is for you. ---  --- On the other hand, if you have more "short-term" preocupations, if you are more "closed" than open to new points of view, or if you want to look at international and economic matters with a more scientific approach, then the AM is not for you. ---  --- Again, as I said, the AM also has an "Arts" section. It's very good but it's not the reason why I buy it. Other may	pos

Young Jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper; yet, he is a motivational speaker.  So, in this case, he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do.  He should just consider himself a rapper; that way, when he's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across, we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model. ---  --- Anyways, with that diatribe aside, this album is nothing new from Jeezy.  We all saw it coming.  He picks out some great beats, but cannot provide the great lyrics to go along with them.  Therefore, an uneven album ensues.  "I Luv It" was the first single and is a prime example.  If this beat might have reached someone such as T.I. or maybe even a group like Clipse, this would've been a great song.  However, it's Jeezy, so it's gonna be a letdown.   ---  --- That's pretty much what this album is; a letdown.  After guest spots on "Grew Up a Screw Up" with Ludacris and the posse cut remix "Top Back" with T.I. & B.G., i was expecting alot from Jeezy this time around.  However, all i got were two tracks ("Go Getta" with R. Kelly & "3 A.M." with Timbaland) that are recommendable.  The rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over average-to-above average production.  If you're looking for "inspiration," look away from this "trap-star.	neg
When I bought this CD it was for a little bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days.

Avatar is so awesome! I saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all. It's got an excellent story line, great characters and awesome animation.

As everyone else has said, this product is not at all what it should be. ---  --- It slows down the internet browsing to a crawl (my laptop that has crashed several times, is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with McAfee). ---  --- You can't close it, as others have said, other than uninstalling. ---  --- The funniest part I've found, however, is that it warns you the first time it tries to access.

I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter.  I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen.  I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit.  I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service.  After repeated messages left on a voice mail system ("we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned.  Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight.  Absolutely useless.  My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT.  This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit	neg

I've had Canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and won't settle for any of those knock-offs. Yeah, they're often much cheaper, but this is one area where you get what you pay for.

I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it.  My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software. ---  --- The Kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when I bought the first camera but they have made some improvements and the updated version is much better.  The Kodak gallery is a nice option that allows you to share pics without sending large email files. ---  --- I haven't used the C533 a lot since I bought it but the pics I've taken have come out great. But just like the other reviews state, slow shutter speed at low light and it does like batteries.  However, if you spend the extra money for the Lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life. ---  --- All in all a great value and a perfect camera for a point and shoot person	pos

I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.

I agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download. In this day and age, there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers.

Oh those were the days, when I was in college, reading my first issues and then subscribing.  There were great things to be found in its pages, columns by Brian Crozier, Russell Kirk, Erik von Kuenhelt-Leddhin (sp?).  The great struggle with the Soviet Union was going into a critical stage.  It seemed NR was so on the right track.  And it was wonderful to read, at least from about 1979 to 1983. ---  --- But then it became for a while duller.  It had some periods of recrudescence, such as under the editorship of John O'Sullivan.  But when Rich Lowry took over NR really began to dumb down (nothing personal Mr. Lowry). ---  --- But what I've really discovered of late is how badly the neo-con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine.  We've got in the 50th Anniversary issue a call by Midge Dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in Iraq.  Really something has happened to the magazine, a sinister force has entrenched itself there.  What is that force?  Well, go to come-and-hear.com and you will begin to learn part of the picture, especially when you read the material by Elizabeth Dilling.  I would also recommend Paul Findley's THEY DARE TO SPEAK OUT, which details the Israeli Lobby's domination of our Congress.   ---  --- NR was once a courageous conservative magazine, but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing. WFB should know better, and maybe he does.  If he doesn't, then he should pick up NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN!, and then he should listen to Tony Martin's talk given to the IHR on a certain group's tactics deployed to suppress free speech.   ---  --- What has inspired me to write this review is WFB's recent column on the incarceration of David Irving.  It ends in a disgusting gloating.  WFB has fallen into an evil trap, and so has the magazine he used to run.  What has happened to the Christian faith of people like Buckley?  He now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group...And you, Mr. Lowry, come on now: read widely and deeply and don't be afraid of reading the Talmud and about the Israeli lobby.  Once you do, maybe you'll develop the strength to think outside the box.  We're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet. ---  --- 	neg
This is one of cinema's great achievements, a testament of the combination of elements (subject, visual style, photographic image, movement, sound, background music, character, montage) are perfectly blended into a unique experience.  The New Yorker print, however, is the worst copy of this film (16mm, 35mm, television screenings) I have ever seen.  This was a copy with a lack of contrast, extra noise on the track, looking like a dub.  If only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice.  As it is, enjoy what you're stuck with but know there's something better out there. ---  --- Burt Shapir	pos

This magazine used to be very thorough, and it used to be very good at providing me with TONS of deals and tips that I never would have found on my own. It was great, and very opinionated. But last year sometime, they changed the look of it and now there's a lot less text. It's much more a style magazine now, and that's not what I want in a travel magazine that I have bought to tell me about money saving! Worse, except for the 40 Best Vacation Bargains, which are still okay, most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest I do expensive things. Since when is a $225 a night hotel considered budget?? The headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky.  It's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be! I noticed that Arthur Frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe is why--bring him back! My search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again	neg

I have to place a rag down before I put the baby in because he will slide forward if I don't.

I wish that it would zip up all the way... The top is coming down all the time and I have to adjusted. Maybe it's better for a two and up age child.	pos
Try them, you'll like them. Yes, it's that simple. :) ---  --- These taste slightly different than most gummis, but in a good way	pos
Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, "Be the first person to write a review"  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?   ---  --- Ok, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item. ---  --- I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background! ---  --- These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off.  ---  --- Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a "ten tippy toes" rating for how well they performed in the test.	pos
The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me.  In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine.  I was however, disappointed in the charger.  The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work.  You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable.  Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best.	neg
This is a well done game, especially if you liked the movie.  Characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there's a cute storyline to the game. ---  --- There are a number of stages that you follow in order, completing one to move to the next. ---  --- There's a pretty small age window that its good for -- I'd say about 6 to 10.  Under 6, the stages are too hard.  Over 10 they're sort of easy and not that engaging -- you can fly thru pretty quickly. ---  --- It would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the "games" that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially, but it's still well done and worth buying	pos
The kit was great I thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors! This toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies,put magginets on them or just play with them! This toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break.If you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one	pos
Used Norton antivirus the last 3 years. getting product in tax software promotions.  No problems until I installed 2007 6 days ago, when my system became really slow and then I was unable to access the internet.  Since their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website, I was thankful my husband's laptop was available. The first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems.  I had identified it was the Worm Protection causing the problem so I turned that off, accessed the file and ran it.  My computer updated twice with no change - if the Worm Protection was on, I wasn't going to be able to access the internet.      ---  --- Worked up my patience and called that evening, only to hold for 48 minutes.  Finally got another native of India who spoke English worse than the first guy. At one point, we were waiting on a restart and I asked her a question about the computer being slower with the 2007 version and she responded, "OK, yes".  Long story short, I hung up an hour later with a link for an update to the 2007 product which I was assured would solve the problem and an email address for her manager. During these two calls, the software was uninstalled, reinstalled, and tested and I spent several hours using the online support.  I updated the product and it worked for a couple hours.  Then I was right back where I began, unable to access the internet unless I turned off the Worm Protection. ---  --- I started the day with 360 days remaining on my subscription but once I updated, the protection center now says my subscription is expired. When I check my Norton account online, it shows I have almost a year remaining before expiration and all their tips to update the proection center have pathetically failed. ---  --- Sent an email to the management address I was given, but of course, haven't heard anything.  I am uninstalling this product and will never use Norton again. ---  	neg
My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday (8/28) and due to missing parts. I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one. For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted. We have been having to go and order parts for the bike. The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out. The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition, it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year. Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape. There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts. --- We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me. I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny.	neg
Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with. ---  --- I've had many other friends who were unhappy with Clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. I'm not trying to knock the product. I'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people I know. I would definitely NOT recommend Clinique to anyone. I'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.	neg
I like the portability and adjustability of this mirror.  It takes up little space and can be stowed away very compactly.  It serves my needs very well.  I was disappointed that only the magnifying mirror is lit.  I tend to use the normal mirror more often.  The other is the clock loses it's setting when I stow it away.  It has to be reset and left out if you were really wanting to use the clock feature.  As far as I am concerned...I was looking for a mirror and really could care less about the clock	pos
I purchased the upgrade since I'd already bought both Office v.X and Virtual PC 6.1 last year.  ---  --- The biggest letdown is that Microsoft's promised support for the G5 is nearly non-existent.  I have a dual processor G5 with an ATI Radeon 9800 card (Apple), and after trying to install Virtual PC 7 three times, I cannot get a VM to work.  It did install (and work) flawlessly on my G4 Powerbook.  Googling for reviews finds it's very hit or miss, but if (when) it misses, you'll regret investing the extra $$$ in an immature product	neg
This does not fold down 90 deg.  Don't buy if you think you'll be able to fold down and change sheets or something	neg
This is the best bed rail if you DO NOT have a box spring. My 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed and I purchased this rail because he has a "bunkie" board instead of a box spring. The length is satisfactory, and the fold-down mechanism is perfect because of the raised hinges. It is easy to make the bed as well. We also purchased it for the grandparent's house because they have a platform bed. It works equally as well. My only complaint is that maybe the rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't been tempted to climb over it. I would recommend this bed rail for a good transition to a "big boy" bed that doesn't have a box spring (although the manufacturer recommends it)	pos
It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth. ---  --- I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart.  I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it. ---  --- I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It "flows" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel "rich"! ---  --- Overall, I like it	pos
I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!	pos
I would like to add to the reviews already posted, especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the 80-400 VR.  This is one of the only times I can remember when I have had the money to buy a Nikon lens, but have not been able to bring myself to do it.  The 80-400 is 6 years old, uses ancient mechanical (slow) focus, and has yet to be updated with VRII technology.  All that, and it still costs more than the pro-quality Canon 100-400 IS, which has Canon's AF-S equivalent too!  That said, I like long yet portable lenses, and after giving myself fits decided to "settle" for the 70-300 because it has VRII and AF-S.  If you are in the same boat then buy this lens, it is a gem for its intended purpose.  I get sharp results wide open at 300, and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures.  I would have LOVED this lens if it was an f/3.5, but even at 4.5-5.6 I have really been surprised at the results.  Save the $1000+ until Nikon updates the 80-400 dinosaur	pos

Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.

Yep, we love this camera! Amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to Las Vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip. The still shots are amazing, you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't. In fact we tested this and have proof, as we had both cameras with us. My son got a great close up of Star Jones from far across the gathered crowd, right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her, and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you can't even tell what the subject was! I love that we have two cameras in one, video and stills, so we don't have to carry both. I really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten to wipe the memory clean. We eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip. It would be nice to have a separate battery charger, but it really didn't get inconvenient, we'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up. And the price was excellent for all the features we got. Yep, we love this camera	pos
Herb Alpert has done what few artists can do. He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original. ---  --- I love the original "Whipped Cream", but this CD is a masterstroke. Combining Alpert's traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing, but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end. ---  --- Unlike some of the purists, I loved this CD and you will too	pos
"The Incredibles", together with "Finding Nemo", "Shrek 1 & 2", "Madagascar" and the "Spy Kids" series, certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking. Particularly The Incredibles is a movie no kid (or adult as well) will ever get tired of watching. As for the plot... it is just plainly great. Things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle. But everything will change for Mr. Incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job. --- My kids just love this movie (and so do I!	pos
This little clock worked exceedingly well at first.  Clear, large display that was bright enough to read but not so bright it was distracting at night.  It takes up little space on a night table, which is great. ---  --- However, if it's on your night table you'll have to angle it so that the clock face is nearly toward the wall, as you can't adjust the projection.  If you face the clock out toward the far wall, the projection will be diplayed upside down. ---  --- Still, I was okay with this, as the projection was what I was interested in.  And that worked great until it accidentally got knocked off the nightstand onto the carpet.  One mishap and the projection was broken.  Nothing could fix it; you can't even open the clock to explore the mechanics of it.  Without the projection, it's simply a procey bed-side alarm clock.  It's my fault for knocking it over, but I would think a clokc of this caliber should be a bit sturdier	pos
I purchased 2 of these and couldn't be more pleased. Like another reviewer, I gave 4 stars only becuase I've only had them for a few days and don't know how they'll weather. They arrive mostly assembled, and took only about 20 minutes to assemble each set. They look great, and are a comfy place to spend an afternoon. ---  --- Not as huge and heavy as the ones we used to make, but they're solid, and much easier to move	pos

The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa	neg
This is the way comedy should be done- warm, funny, heart-touching, with a little craziness thrown in.   ---  --- Hector Elizondo and Raquel Welch are perfect- he's understated, she's over the top...just like the movie. The story never bogs down, but zips right along nicely. The sisters bicker, their father worries, Hortensia (Welch) does her best to snag him, and we laugh.  Great fun! ---  --- A note on the rating for parents like me who wonder about the PG13 rating (one can never tell these days!): There's one woman shown in skimpy underclothing, and one sex scene along with sexual references and jokes, so this would not be suitable for kids	pos
I was initially very happy with this product.  We purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed.  However, the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use.  Since I liked the product, I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one.  It, too, broke; so I'm now looking for a sturdier alternative	neg
I heard this music on the excellent P B S Documentary: "Liberty - the American Revolution" and I knew I had to have it! It is the finest music I have heard, capturing the heart and soul of the American Revolution. The documentary "Liberty" was a masterpiece that was beautiful and moving. So too this music with its most wonderful arrangements and accompaniment. I love it! I could hardly wait to get it in the mail. It framed the documentary (which I also bought) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas painting. Superlatives fail me. This music must be experienced by first watching the great series on the American Revolution and then by listening to it apart. This is some of the most wonderful music I have ever heard. It reminds me of the genius of Aaron Copland who wrote the Applachian Spring and Rodeo suites	pos
I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera. --- After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue.

Cast:  Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J. Pagan. --- Running Time:  123 minutes --- Rated R for violence and language. ---  --- "Fallen" starts with convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting Hobbes, ruining his life & career, setting him up for murder & getting to his friends & family. Hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him & everyone he cares about. ---  --- Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future.  The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.  Although this film does require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours.  "Fallen" is an intelligently written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.  One of the better of its kind	pos

When I first picked up Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  And, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  It is entertaining, the style works, etc.  On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book. ---  --- Probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the African American female. Packer has very little new to say, and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by Alice Walker and other writers, but have also have been said better by those authors.  Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down, a book that, while having its own problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text. ---  --- Even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.  The characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable.  The adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so.  The other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.  Similar to this lack of variation in her characters, Packer varies little in her narrative style.  Yes, the language is pretty at times, but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.  Finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative. ---  --- In short, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs you.  Packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out	neg

I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!! --- So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon.	neg
I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so.

This metal detector is nice, notwithstanding, it performs poorly when in all metal mode.  Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on.  When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably.  It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy.  Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it.  I could hold it into the air and it still squeals.  I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise.  This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour.  Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon	neg
I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need.

This give an excellent finish to a shave.  I strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well.  Apply hot water to dilate your pores, then apply the oil, then shaving cream, shave, and finally the after shave balm.  The oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience.  Your face feels incredibly smooth afterward.  I don't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone, but I do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after	pos
I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed.  ---  --- First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people. ---  --- I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review. ---  --- If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star). 	neg

This game is really great. I would recommend this game to anyone. It's a great game to play with the family or by yourself. I have had this game for awhile now and have finished it about 2 times.

This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money	pos
I like this camera.  Some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience. For a first-timer, it has been great. The camera rates 4 stars. ---  --- Customer service, on the other hand, has been a disaster. An Easy Share software downloaded update didn't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1/2 hours with no resolution. After requesting to speak to a customer service manager, I was promised that a $7.95 CD of the software would be sent for free (though it was clear he was doing me a favor because "these cd's cost money and don't grow on trees," he said. Whether or not the CD solves the problem remains to be seen. But customer service is awful. ---  --- To recap: Nice camera, but unless you have endless customer service patience, search out other options	neg
Arrived on time and is perfect for using headphones and speakers at the same time.	pos
Dear all ---  --- I have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one.It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed.  --- An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times. --- MP3 player is so gud...but had to purchase an addition mem card. --- I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile..which makes it trust at ruining times.. --- Thanks for tmobile and amazon... ---  --- Hope this help	pos
We may never know if we like this product as the Amazon box was empty when it arrived.  We have had no help from amazon, compusa, nor the maker of this software after numerous emails and phone calls.  This was my son's Christmas present and he's still waiting... at this rate we'll end up with the opinion that we shouldn't order software online...	neg
I don't even own this CD, and after seeing the reviews I don't want it.  90% of the "5 star" reviews are people with ONLY ONE review.  Suspicious?? Look for yourself, it's right there to see.  I have some other meditation CDs that are very repetitive, I'm not going to make the same mistake here, especially with such SHAMELESS self-promotion	neg
I did a lot of research before buying the PV-GS250.  Now that I have the camera in my hands I know I made a great choice.  Great image quality. Great build quality. The low light problems you read about are not really a big deal.  In a noramlly lit room everything is fine. 	pos
I love the xbox 360,I got it about 2 months ago.I remember my friend saying wait for the ps3,i told him im not waiting for that overhyped overpriced system.The xbox 360 live is amazing and is so much fun.The graphics and sound are great to.I dont have an hd tv either but you can tell a great deal of difference(you need real cables people.dont use the cheap ones that come with it and use the components not the stupid yellow video plug).The wireless controllers are great.the main thing are games,theres good ones and bad ones,choose very wisely.But there alot of good ones right now to choose from.And make sure you get the xbox with the 20 gig hard drive,theres no other way to have it	pos
I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target	neg
My daughter was very excited to receive this for Christmas, until she tried to change the thread that came with the machine.  It literally would not work anymore.  I tried everything.  Maybe it's defective.....but from other reviews I read, I think it's just a really bad attempt at a great idea. Too bad....she is very disappointed....	neg
Adding another Italian classic to our product line, Puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which, to put it modestly, translates into "a lot of things going on at the same time".  The rich combination of flavors: garlic, black olives, capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking.   ---  --- Recipe suggestions:  Use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken, fish...or your relationship - just heat and serve, or bake it in.  Try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative!  The favorite? Grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on.	pos
My title says it all. This smells so amazing, and is such a lush and fabulous lather, that I will never wash with any other soap again. I even bought the perfume because I found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower.  ---  --- It's fantastic, it's totally worth the money, and it lasts a long time. One bottle lasts me 2-3 months, bathing every day. I've even used this in my hair before... but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and I need a lot of moisture because I have blonded curly hair.	pos
Can't beat it!  This was made world famous in Pike Place Market and is now available on the internet	pos
The pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial. Quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised. The chain is a little long (for me) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level, but it's so lovely I haven't bothered to find a new chain	pos
I really do love this item. I've been using it without fail since the day it arrived. I haven't had any significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone. I hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor. ---  --- The only problem I have found is that I can't grip things and have the monitor continue working. So when I am lifting weights I have to leave that finger extended, when I'm using the eliptical trainer I have to leave that finger extended. Now that I'm used it, it isn't a big deal. ---  --- It is accurate. So far it has agreed with all other monitors that I've checked it against. So with the one minor exception I highly recommend it	pos
An OK gadget, but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well. It does not have an automatic shut off, so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil. Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this	neg
You can't get these anywhere in this town, but amazon has saved the day! There were plenty of leaves and they were very tasty in the tom ka soup we made and various other dishes.  Good and fresh	pos
This outdoor bird cage is ideal in the winter because it has a strong wire mesh that prohibits piles of snow or manure to fall into the living area of the bird.  Works well with mostly smaller birds, plenty of room for seeds and water, even a furry friend or two, can also substitute for a squirrel cage or a mini buddhist temple for midgets	pos
We bought our Floppy Seat when our baby boy was about 6 months old.  Even though he was still a little "floppy" himself when it came to sitting up, the Floppy Seat supported him. He's now 18 months old, and it's still going strong!  Although, now he wears "real" shoes, and the leg openings tend to get caught on then. It took a little practice to get the hang of the threading the belt through the cart, but now it's SO fast!   ---  --- We also use it EVERY time we go out to eat.  As a matter of fact, the one (and ONLY) time we forgot to bring it along, our son started to choke while sitting in a restaurant highchair.  The belt buckle on the old restaurant chair became stuck, and would NOT open, after multiple attempts!  We were forced to turn the whole chair sideways in order to proceed to clear his airway. He was fine, but we were all shaken up! If we'd had our (familiar) floppy Seat cover, we would have been able to help our son a few moments faster. Every second counts!	pos
I was pleasantly surprised with the high-0quality of the merchandise.  My mother-in-law loved it	pos

When I bought this toy, I thought it was SOOOO COOL. But it really doesn't do ANYTHING it's supposed to do! It just makes annoying crying and whining noises that DO NOT sound real. Even if I tickle its tummy it just whines and cries. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this toy!!!!	neg
I have owned many beard trimmers, but this is by far the best. 	pos
If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible.  As this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his life... that's all we have now.  And of course the covers do not outdo him; that would be impossible.  But there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world he lived in.  The discussion with a former classmate is touching, and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin Youngblood Heart blew me away.  Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work.  The major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance, which is just plain bad.  All in all, it is a good film, and it's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we will never be able to see the real thing	pos
I purchased the Kwik Kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with.  It was fairly easy to put together and, once the base is filled with sand (it cannot be filled with water), it's simple to move it from place to place.  The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs!  I love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors, so he'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year.  Great Product	pos
First of al it is not stainless steel. It has exactly its price do not think it is too cheap...Handle is not that reliable it is like it's gonna break easily I mean don't think of any usage. It is only for decoration.	neg
Even if one could afford the full PhotoShop CS or CS2, Elements has it all for the photo enthusiast.  Elements has an uncluttered interface with two choices for photo manipulation; --- Quick Fix and Standard Edit. The Browser is adequate though I've used simpler ones for organizing and finding photos. Many of the features of the full program can be found in Elements like Layers, plug-ins for effects, and a variety of adjustmens.  With a little patience and experimenting, as well as magazines that include video tutorials for specific needs you'll be surprised how creative you can be. This program does not have the learning curve of the full PhotoShop software yet is more than powerful enough for the creative amateur photographer	pos
After opening the weather station and setting it up, I noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing "characters".  I contacted Amazon and returned it.  Within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem.  When I contacted them again, they would not replace it again, saying that the "batch" they have must be defective.  I was not aware that Amazon was selling the "seconds" from other retailers.  A phone call to LaCrosse remedied the situation.  They advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace/repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises.  They further advised the "fail ratio" with the problem I had with both units is less than 1%.  Beware if buying this from Amazon	neg
I was looking for a double stroller that I could get in and out of my sedan easily. I didn't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space, but they are also very heavy. This stroller is light, and I can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand. Plus, because my kids are heavy enough to push, I am not pushing an extra 25+ pounds in stroller. Because it is side-by-side, it can be a tight fit going through some doors, but I have never been unable to get through a door.   ---  --- My husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily, but with 6 months of lots of use, we have had no problems. The sun visors have bent at an angle when storing, but I can still use them fine and I like that they rotate down, so you can angle them with the sun. I am so glad that I bought this rather than a larger, more expensive, heavier tandem stroller	pos
Have tried about six times to install it.  I've followed all of the online troubleshooting advice, all to no avail.  It says it installed with three nonfatal errors and five warnings.  It tells you to check the log.  Well, there are over 85k entries and even if I found the errors I don't see any way to correct the errors. When I try to run it I get "starter MFC Application has encountered a problem and needs to close".  I'll be returning this puppy to Amazon for a replacement	neg
This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment	neg
Quick shipping on product but the product was not what I was hoping for.  The "snow" was much grainer than I had expected.  I had seen what I thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that "instant snow" was very fine and really looked like snow.  This product doesn't look much like snow and doesn't have the same texture	neg
I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute.  ---  --- This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs	neg
Great compact design. Takes up very little room in your suitcase. Rollers heat up & are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims. Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many). The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers. But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set & use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!	pos
This was not the scariest film I've ever seen, and I really can't take horror very well. But it was good, because there was beauty in it, and that is quite rare in horror films. I think the idea of the film was very good, and surprise in the end too, even though the plot was not so brilliant. ---  I actually liked it. I'll probablu rent it again and watch it this time with sound. ---  --- 	pos
Play Table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson (18 months) loves it.  It is good for small children - better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over. I wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely	pos
I have been a faithful Mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids. This game is a big disappointment. The language game is virtually unplayable in French. I am fluent in French and went to a French language university for nine years. I could barely understand what the characters were saying. If this program is intended to teach kids a second language, it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead. This game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of French	neg
Daylight savings time in the US has changed.  These watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules.  While you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks, twice a year, it kind of defeats the whole purpose	neg
This watch looks like business.  The movement is what I really like.  You get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping (though I wouldn't call it sweeping).  I give it a 5 based on looks and cost.  I haven't had it long, and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly (it was losing a few hours at night).  I guess it just needed to get charged up.  It's no Rolex, but it's no Casio either. 	pos
As soon as I received this radio I tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up. The base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio. I am looking to return this item as it is not designed right.  --- I cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken! ---  --- Overall, it's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials.	neg
I have had this camera for about a year.  It has been nothing but a problem.  First, the kodak easyshare software has continuous problems.  I have spent HOURS trying to fix it.  Still has bugs in it no matter what I do.  ---  --- Secondly, the camera is very unreliable.  I have a wedding to go to this weekend and I do not trust it and am taking a disposable camera too.  How do I explain the problems I have had?  There are so many.  The camera misfunctions continuously.  Sometimes it does nothing at all.  Other times the zoom lense will not shut.  You turn the option selector on and even though it is on the option you select you get another option.  I sometimes can not even shut the camera off I gotta take the batteries out to do so...if I can even find batteries that work in the camera. ---  --- Honestly, I call tech supoport and told them the problems I have having and they tell me that only Kodak batteries work with the camera and told me to buy some.  SO I went to a nice camera shop and they do not sell kodak batteries.  The camera salesman told me that Kodak cameras are junk and the brand of battery should not matter.  I believe him.  So my camera which would not work...I asked the salesman to help me out.  It did not work with any lithium batteries.....reusable or rechargable. He popped in some alkaline batteries and amazingly it worked.  Well, everyone knows alkaline batteries have a real short short life.  My camera now does not work with either batteries.  Probably only Kodak batteries....maybe....or maybe Kodak wants to get another ten bucks out of me. ---  --- I personally don't even think the pictures this camera takes are any good.  Really, when people take pictures of me with this camera my eyes are always closed.  I am so anxious to get rid of this camera.....well would be but know I gotta fork over at least $250 on a good camera.  Trying to save money on this 'disposable' camera was a waste.  STAY AWAY FROM KODAK CAMERAS!  If you don't believe me get a creditable camera magazine and read reviews. --- 	neg
We have a slightly sloped yard so I was hesitant about getting a trampoline.  We tried it, and it works fine!  My kids love it!  Of course, like any other toy, they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months.  I was also concerned at first about them falling off of it.  I almost bought the enclosure to go with it but I decided to wait and see how high they jumped, etc.  This trampoline is so small, they really can't get a lot of "air" so they don't do flips and other dangerous tricks.  It's also very low to the ground.  I am glad now that I didn't get the enclosure.  We don't really need it.  I would recommend this trampoline for younger kids.  The weight limit is 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids.  Also, since it is so small, we only let our two preschoolers jump together.  When we have guests over, it's one at a time.  I love it that my kids want to be outside so much.  This is better money spent than on video games, in my opinion	pos
If you are a hardcore Family Guy fan like me (I am actually one of the few people that watched Family Guy when it was originally on the air), you will not be disappointed with this Monopoly version. The box is beautifully designed with the Griffin family pictured on center, and some easter eggs to look around for. The board is not the most impressive one especially compared to The Simpson's and Muppets Monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the Griffins at center. What you will love of the board is the properties, which include everything from Chris' Closet and Seamus' Lighthouse to James Woods High and Geronimo's Palace to The Clam and Channel 5 News to Mayor West's Mansion and finally Petoria, all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the Stewie's Untold Story movie. The property deeds are somewhat disappointing though. The do not have color watermarks like those found in the Simpson's version, but I guess they will do.  ---  --- Peter's Fishing Boat, Hinden-Peter, Peter-Copter and the Pope Mobile replace the Railroads. I bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $200.00 (Income Tax) for Volcano Insurance or $75.00 for Workplace Sensitivity Training (Luxury Tax) but hey, you can't stay mad for long at the Salesman Guy, right? It would have been cool to have Joe Swanson on the Go To Jail space and have a picture of Quahog Prison on the jail space but well, what can you do?  ---  --- The Pewter Tokens are nice. You can chose from TV Junkie Peter, Mug in hand Brian, Nose picking Chris, Lois, Stewie in a high chair and Meg (who looks like a Peanut character). You can also order four more tokens that include The Giant Chicken, Quagmire, Joe and the Evil Monkey.  ---  --- The coolest changes are the Chance and Community Chest cards that are replaced by the What the Deuce! and Giggity! Giggity! Giggity! cards, respectively. They are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like; Made Sheriff of Bumblescum ADVANCE TO GO, Get Liposuction and Implants Pay $100, Confederate Civil War Veterans are After You Go Back 3 Spaces, Take Big Fat Paulie to The Movies as a Favor Collect $25.00, Help Death get a Girlfriend Collect $100, and many more.  ---  --- The money goes as follows $1 - Meg, $5 - Chris $10 - Lois, $20 - Brian, $50 - Stewie, $100 - Peter, $500 - The Griffins  ---  --- There are no special rules for this version, which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special Monopoly versions.  ---  --- To wrap it up I must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done Monopoly game. Family Guy fans will love it making this a great gift. HAVE FUN	pos
This magazine is fun and upbeat. The pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text. If the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying. There are many many recipes. One section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week. A great magazine. Well worth the money.	pos
Two of the worst stories in the history of TOS, but for different reasons. The 'Way to Eden' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy, and so dates badly.  What the real problem is though is that it makes the Enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment, especially of all people Captain Kirk. 'Requiem for Methuselah' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of Da Vinci, Brahms and others.  What it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for Kirk's relationships with women.  Threre is no way any woman would have Kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her, he is far to full of his own importance for that. This effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode. A real pity	neg
This was the hit of Christmas Eve.  I gave one to my brother and husband and everyone one wanted one.  It projects light way out in front of you and is a must have for power outages and walking in the evening. Great product.  I am ordering several more	pos
Sing in me oh muse on this snow day, and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea. The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry.  --- Since conception, I have been in love with tea, but "the Prince" was my first fine tea. I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it's still my favourite. --- Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too.  --- Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I've had, this one is the clear winner. I've gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion. --- My only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France? Viva la Revolution! ---  --- rws, 26/1/0	pos

Contrary to what the box and description here says this disc has NO subtitles or closed captions or whatever. The R2 neither. ---  --- So again, don't feel sorry for the film companies about their complaining of copying of films and stuff. ---  --- Non anamorphic or simply 4:3 format, no subs, not available at all (yes I mean you, Disney)... In short, no quality or consistency. Go and take a hike. ---  --- Stop lobbying for legislation and start making real DVD's	pos
I've been to a lot of concerts, met a lot of bands, seen a lot of hype, seen a lot of scandal. This magazine is pretty much the best source of any up-and-coming band that you may be hearing on the radio or seeing on MTV. --- Not only is SPIN the best magazine for music for "kids my age (22)" but the picture quality is some of the best quality that I have seen in any magazine. I have framed pages out of previous spin magazines, because they were pictures I wanted to keep forever. I would recommend spin magazine to any fan of indie rock especially. Death cab for cutie, the shins, and the flamming lips are just some of the bands that are talked about in SPIN magazine monthly. SPIN magazine does include some rap/hip-hop music that I try to avoid but the indie-rock and rock band information that I receive is some of the best.	pos
Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. "The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield," on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind. ---  --- This movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go elsewhere; this one is not merely bad, but evil	neg
I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with. --- This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video. --- The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution. --- I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras. --- Cons: --- * Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone --- * Buttons are harder to find --- * Software is not the best --- * Wish had more zoom --- Pros: --- * Convince --- * Compact --- * Battery lasts long --- * Flash is good --- * Video sound quality is good --- I wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing	pos
I'd do business with these guys again.  The shipment made it on time and was just as I expected.  The only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when I opened the box	pos
This toy seemed like a fun idea, however it is utter chaos.  The toy moves randomly over the page and does not make any sort of comprehensive design.  Actually our table received more ink than the paper and then the kids could not get it to turn off.  I think it may be slightly posessed! 	neg
I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again	neg
I was looking forward to purchasing this item until I got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost.  The cheapest shipping would run me 14.99 for an item costing 21.89.  Sorry WeatherBuffs, you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price. 	neg
I bought this because I love all the other Fisher Price Aquarium stuff we have. But... we haven't been thrilled with this tub. The hammock can only be used until the baby is 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child was over 9 lbs at birth... so she used it like 2 weeks. Even so, the hammock sags onto this HARD BUMP in the middle of the hammock so the baby's back rests on this bump. Never seemed comfortable. Then we used it with the hammock attached only at the top like the instructions say but our daughter outgrew the infant side because her butt would slide right over the bump that was supposed to support her but she can't sit up to use the other side. There are better tubs out there	neg
For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger	neg

Harper's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest American- writers , from Mark Twain on down. Its editor and tone- setter is the veteran journalist Lewis Lapham. It publishes fiction, and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of American economic, political and cultural life. It attracts the big - names in all areas, and also provides a lot of human - interest material, statistical curiosities, historical information and stories. --- For some reason which I do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite. And in the old days I preferred 'the Atlantic' and the 'Saturday Review of Literature ' to it. Of course one of the features of 'Harper's is its book- reviews done by among others today, John Leonard.  --- I suppose what has soured me a bit on 'Harper's' is its bias to the political left. --- But that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality	pos
Actually, we love the game very much but are very disappointed with Pressman Toys.  Here's the scoop:  our game came with only 20 pegs of each color -- the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color.  We've called the company 1800 800-0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs.  Just bad business practice in my opinion.  As the saying goes, when you love something you tell a few people, when you're not happy you tell everyone.  I'll be sure to check that I'm not buying items from Pressman Toys next time.  So instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we'll just have to win in fewer steps.  SIGH!	neg
Having been engaged in 35mm photography for 32 years, I approached digital photography with great reluctance.  I knew there would be an essential learning phase with less than ideal pictures, like my playing with a brownie for a few years as a kid -- this further delayed my plunge.  Finally, an upcoming trip overseas compounded with the knowledge of what airport metal detectors do to film forced the issue. ---  --- My choice was cinched by some pictures we acquired from a friend of papal conclave 2006.  We ran them as a screen saver, and I was much impressed by the sharpness, color tonality, and depth of field -- especially in cloudy day pictures of crowds in public squares.  Faces far into the background were discernable.  I asked what was used and it was this camera.  At the camera store I was heartened to see it felt like a mini SLR in the hand, had a nice big viewer and uncomplicated, straightforward controls. ---  --- The learning phase in the backyard and around town gave me some doubts.  Lack of no-shake feature is the model's biggest downside; a lot got blurred especially using the zoom feature on moving subjects.  Some of this you learn to shake out using point focus, but you still are going to lose a few  precious moments despite your best efforts.  Nor with the limited equivalent ASA range are you going to be able to get the sort of pics in museums or dark old cathedrals you are used to with a good SLR and high speed film -- but remember, this one is a starter.  This thing is a monster battery eater, too:  always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets with you.  On the plus side, choice of black and white and chrome mode is very nice feature, and the built-in zoom has a very decent range and performance on stationary subjects.  Speed of use may or may not compare well to other digitals, I don't know, but its a whole world superior to my old world.  There is a rather steely patina to even the best color images, I see now after viewing hundreds, but that's a decent trade-off for the general ease of use and clarity.  Incidentally, the lens on this camera gives you a lot more than what you would expect from a 4 megapixel rating. ---  --- Back from Europe this week, I have 2000+ jpegs (the keepers) all of very high quality, an achievement I could not have come close to, I am sure, either with old film camera or with most other starter level digitals.  The continuing issue of shake and blur I surmounted by simply multiple shooting a lot (sometimes 5-7 images); you can erase them almost as quickly as you shoot them, and come to see this as a small nuisance in the bigger trade-off.   ---  --- I do not plan to spend the rest of my life with this level digital camera, but even after I move up I think I will keep it around for sheer utilty and ease of use in the general every day world.  For the price, this is about as good a deal as one can hope for.	pos

I ordered back issues of this magazine from an Ebay dealer in the UK after the Spring 2006 issue came out and I am sold not just on Burda Plus but on Berlin fashion designers as well- the women, anyway, make lovely, flowing but not "girly" clothes that are very wearable - Think Eileen Fisher or Flax but with  darker, richer colors, fibers and textures, slightly more "fit" and more interesting shapes in a wider variety -- not just the same few repeated again and again.  Clothes for the decades, not the season -- and the patterns are HERE!  at least some of them, from designers like Evelyn Brandt, Doris Strietch (and another Berliner (female)  whose name escapes me at the moment, but whose clothes I deeply admire.)  --- The fit is better than most American pattern companies - especially pants.  If you make one garment from each issue the subscription has more than paid for itself.  Good info on sizing patterns up or down in the back issues I recently received - keeping the proportions if using a "petite" or a "tall" pattern if you are neither. Pattern directions themselves can be less than enlightening, though - perhaps "non-fluent" would be the best description of their translation.  And the breathless tone (LOTS of exclamation points!!!!) of the editorial content seems a bit much for such "smart" clothes, but we're not buying this for the elegancce of the writing! ---  --- Another reviewer complained of delivery delay.  This is only published in January and July.  If you missed subscribing in time for the last issue and the print run is gone, you have to wait until the next one pubs.  And the print runs DO sell out.  As I can attest	pos

Although I have only read a few specific subjects in this book, I am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life-threatening disease. For anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition. Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long effects. (...	neg
I do like this organizer, since the stroller I have doesn't have any holders on itself (for the "pusher").   There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder.   I don't have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I'm out using the stroller, I'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder.  We're used to the Graco-designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders.  It's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink...but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink.  :-	pos

I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money.  I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials.  However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials. ---  --- This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2).  Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels. ---  --- I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it.  They have packed so much more value into their package.  And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level. ---  --- I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it.  I think it borders on being a scam	neg
I agree with the other negative review below- Uninspired, simply forgettable radio trash.  Cliched lyrics?  Check.  Muddy, simple riffs?  Check.

I bought my Canon A540 recently from Amazon and am completely satisfied. I added a 1Gb SD card for $11 from Ebay and a charger with 4 2500NiMH AA batteries from the supermarket.  The images are clear and large. You have the options of full automatic, various manual settings up to full manual and a wide selection of preprogrammed modes.   ---  --- At work we needed a new camera to record tiny scratches and imperfections in our manufactured product, so I took my camera in to demo. Using the standard lens (a macro lens is available but I don't have it yet) we photographed a quarter using only ambient light. In less than a minute we had the image on the screen and were able to blow it up until the date filled the screen and still maintain good detail.  As a result we are now buying one for work with a macro accessory lens. ---  --- I totally recommend it as an excellent all rounder	pos

I am a pretty picky shopper, but I have fallen in love with this product.  My now 6 1/2 month old daughter has terrible reflux and this is the only place I could ever get her to sleep comfortably.

I bought this car seat because it looked actractive and safe.  Well, after one month I returned it because it is the worst car seat ever.  The car seat sits so upright that my sons head was always falling completely forward.  He never looked comfortable.  The car seat comes with the strap covers that are suppose to make the car seat comfortable.  These things only make it worse because they are extremely rough and bulky.   ---  --- This car seat is extremely heavy even without the infant in it.  The carrying handle is a joke because you have to push the canopy back to put your arm under it.  The canopy is also terrible because it barely works.  It only works when the sun is directly above you in the sky.  I was constantly having to change the direction I was carrying the car seat to avoid the sun beaming on his face.  (unlike the Graco where you can pull the shade all the way down)  I hated returning this because I really liked the looks of it but I had to for my sons sake.  I bought the graco seat in the blackwell print (which is an o.k. looking fabric).   ---  --- We are both soooo much happier.  He looks comfortable and a little more reclined.  The sun isn't in his face and I have $130 extra dollars that I can spend on something else.  I think people mainly buy peg perego because they like the way it looks (as I did) or because they expect it to be high quality because of the high price (as I did).  But in actuality it just sucks.  I wish that Graco would make their prouducts a little more stylish because they are definitly more practical and functional.	neg
The author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were past.  --- Here are some things that I am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book, which it might help to know: ---  --- 1. Rollins does not think it's possible to really "know" much theology with "certainty." In fact, to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an "idolatrous" view of God that is more our idea of God than really who God is. This is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans, and because in his view, God was not all that interested in presenting much of Himself in any sort of nailed down way.  The irony I could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views. --- He is very certain of his interpretations of "perceptive thinkers like Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx," Eckhart, Augustine, etc... and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from Scripture are correct. I found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really, really, faulty. As I'm reading along I kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the New Testament. So, be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the Bible's basic content.  He is certain that no one should be certain, but him. Ok, to be fair, he is not certain if Christianity is true, and says so on page 44, but he is certain that he should not be certain of Christianity. Nor, I guess, should you. With his view of "critique of ideology" how can he be so selective of what he is certain of. This seems like a self-defeating ideology.  --- So strong is his disdain for "knowing" with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all. I was reminded of the case Francis Schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true, but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway. Rollins needs to reread his Francis Schaeffer, in my opinion.  --- He says the church is not to be about giving answers, but helping raise in people: questioning. Indeed, given his views, how could he provide answers? This book may look deep. I propose, it is merely muddy. ---  --- 2. He redefines age old terms. Orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes, but how loosely one holds it. Certainty of revealed truth is dangerous, misinformed, idolatrous. Heresy is now a cute little thing. It has come of age. He says people will think his views undermine Christianity. We are to just take him at his word that his views won't do so, but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would, I think, see the writing on the wall. ---   --- 3. He seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns. After reading his views I wonder if it is possible for post moderns, those like himself, at least, to even understand the gospel. He has not. How can he be a bridge? To be a bridge one must have footing on both shores. Christianity IS based on real events with real content that has been passed down, not without mystery, nor without debate, but in a very real and tangible way. he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else. ---   --- 4. He is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them. The problem that is huge, and no one seems to notice, is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the Christians who are in other camps. He considers fundamentalists,and by logical extension many evangelicals, to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term, heresy. I kept thinking, what kind of "fundamentalists" is he so angry at? He blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals, making generalizations that are misleading. Very unobjective. Unkind. Very divisive. Yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to Christendom. I can see his views bringing unity to all religions, but it will never bring unity to Christendom. He seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in Christendom. Times have really changed in the past 20 years. He is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind.  ---  --- 5. He makes God hopelessly difficult. God wanted, it seems, to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people, the dust of humanity, the lowly donkey ride, the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel. Rollins has wrapped God up in Nietzsche and while disdaining "human reason" as the means of knowing God has turned the living Christ who said "I am the truth" into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it. God's message is simple. It's clear where it needs to be. It hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated. Rollins makes it nearly all enigma, hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking God, who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it, yet Who has been unwilling or incapable, given man's weaknesses, or His own lack of communication skills, to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly. --- If, as Tickle says, this is the Christianity of the 3rd millenium, then the Chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man's religion, the anything goes religion, and following generations will have to deconstruct today's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism. Peter, I can learn some stuff from you, and I'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission. As it stands now I cannot agree with you on several points. Your views trouble me. Nothing against you personally.  Forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone. I hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more, though, it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor. Regardless, if it inspires I'll come back and add a star. hmmm	neg

My all-around favorite lens in the Canon EOS system is the 50/1.4.  I find that most of the time, most of the pictures I want to take can be achieved using hte 50mm focal length, and the fast aperture allows me to take photos in low light. ---  --- I bought the 24-70/2.8 in hopes of getting high quality images from a zoom lens, as a lot of my pictures weren't in particularly dark places, and the flexibility to get a little wider or closer sounded appealing. ---  --- I was not disappointed. ---  --- The image quality produced by the 24-70/2.8 is outstanding.  Great color, great sharpness.  It might not make images quite as striking as Canon's 135/2 lens, but they are very good indeed. ---  --- Does this lens replace the 50/1.4?  No way.  The 50 is a lot smaller, weighs a lot less, and is still much better for low light shooting.  But for photographing events where you don't want to lug around several prime lenses or go to extreme lenghts to frame the shot better, the 24-70 can be a great tool	pos
The optical x6 zoom on the Canon A710 IS is already better than cameras in it s range (i.e. non SLR). However, the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size; the tele converter lens really does make a difference.  ---  --- Firstly, if there are any negatives, they are very minor; the lens and adapter are black - would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera. Erm, that's it! ---  --- The main quality of Canon is the lens, which they always do well. The clarity of this lens is very good, with very little fuzziness at the edge. It also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected. The electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment. The tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want.	pos

 ---        Okay, so our Moms said we shouldn't compare, but I couldn't help it once I found Sephora's Powder Brush.  It's hair and handles above all the rest.  Used to think a brush was a brush was a brush, which is probably why my "rest" includes artificial haired brushes that left powdered streaks on my face and one that shed whatever kind of hairs it possessed faster than a Sheepdog in August. ---  ---  Enough of my sad cosmetic catastrophes - this Sephora brush is made of 100% goat hair, fine and soft to pick up powder and allow you to apply either pressed or loose powder sleekly and smoothly.  Did I say it feels like silk on your skin?  It does. ---  ---  Additionally, the brush hairs are rounded rather than cut straight across so it"s quick on the "pick-up" and consistently even on the distribution.  Of course, it's good looking with a state-of-the art silver handle.  It measures 8 inches - more importantly, it measures up to everything a perfect powder brush should be. ---  ---         - Gail Cook	pos
I got this as a recommendation from a friend and I found this to taste really wonderful. It comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon.

I bought this for my children's room which has an outer space theme.  The planets are nicely done and look great.  No, they don't glow in the dark all night long... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?!  They certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep!  We have a round ceiling light which I put triangular "rays" around which is now our SUN.   --- I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink.  BUT, the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (I've even seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive.  We put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package.  It gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away!! 	pos
If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding. ---  --- A long time ago, I used Word Perfect. However, my earlier jobs required I use MS Word, so I did my best to become a Word guru. I believe I accomplished that short of creating custom macros. As a law clerk, I started a new job where WordPerfect was the standard. ---  --- So, last year I bought WordPerfect 12. At first it was difficult, but I bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks. With the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that WordPerfect gives the author a great degree of control (especially with show-codes), I was soon able to become a WordPerfect guru. I remembered all the things I used to love about WordPerfect. Like any lover, I also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of WordPerfect. (One of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward, which, once you get accustomed to it, is really a nice feature.) Wordperfect and PDFs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to Federal courts. ---  --- There were two complaints I found at work among Word devotees: 1) the ability to export to PDF but not import and 2) the inability to cut from a Word document into a WordPerfect document without creating all the formatting litter Word likes to use. ---  --- 1. We occasionally receive PDFs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits. With the ability to import PDFs (that is, those that were authored and exported into PDF, not documents scanned into PDF), we were now able to edit those PDFs. This was a real time saver. Since PDF is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix), this was a great improvement. ---  --- 2. Formatting litter is a real pain to deal with. I never could get a MS Word document to just import into WordPerfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting. My solution was to copy the portion out of MS Word, paste into a text file, copy again and then paste into WordPerfect. My complaint was I could not just straight paste into WordPerfect. Well, Corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text. The lone MS Word holdout in my office capitulated with that. He has no more to complain about. ---  --- Another great thing about WordPerfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years (I heard a WP rep say no change since 1995). Why should it? Everything you could want to do in a document (perhaps barring professional typesetting) can be done in WordPerfect. There's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works. ---  --- This product does exactly what those who have come to love WP expect it to do. I think Corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with WP. ---  --- So, if you're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself, WPX3 is representative of what you're looking for	pos

While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses. ---  --- Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience. ---  --- Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first	neg
I baught this game because, I was hopping for a good multiplayer first person shooter for the Wii. But, this was not the case... the multipler is crap. It is jsut your basic oldschool 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1... I am more prone to multi player games like time splitters, where you can all be on a time. So i was pretty dissapointed. The story is great though. It really takes advantage of the Wii mote, and has a great storyline!! I jsut wish it had a better multiplayer :	pos
My daughter, age 9, purchased this product after seeing on tv the many ways she could create images on paper as well clothing, backpacks etc.  Upon opening and struggling to assemble it, we realized that it was useless.  It is very difficult to use on paper and I can not imagine using it on an item such as a jacket.  I emailed the company to complain and after 5 months they responded with a standard - return it to the store you bought it at (an option I did not feel we had since it had been opened and used).  They should have just said "tough luck (...)".  Save your money, avoid this company and get a bunch of stencils instead. 	neg

I'm going to be completely honest with you. I hated the HP camera's because 1. does not take great pictures at night 2. digital zoom is not great either 3. blur's out if you do not stand still taking the picture. I've had an old HP camera and I have had this newer HP camera and they are all the same. It doesnt seem like it really matters what MP they are. Still bur's out and it is disappointing. I guess it really depends on the person about this camera but I'd rather have a Sony, Samsung, or some other company's item. =	neg
This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . .  ---  --- Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice."  ---  --- With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings.  ---  --- There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch:  ---  --- (1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors. ---  --- (2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.)  ---  --- (3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches.  ---  --- Now, the CONS:  ---  --- (1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses.  ---  --- (2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading.  ---  --- In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch.  ---  --- If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star	neg

Disaster. Supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but WILL NOT work with other desk phones! It ONLY works with cordless phones. I wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset. We were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones. No mention of the hold 'music' in the manual. This product is a mess. STAY AWAY. Get a real phone system	neg
I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead.  They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.   ---  --- One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately.  Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get.  Another waste of money from Avent.	neg
I have bought this set for a gift, but also received it as a gift myself (from my registry).  Although my daughter is two and a half now, I would recommend the Playtex nursers to everyone!  They are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles.  I definitely like the Drop-Ins liners better than the traditional ones...  from a convenience standpoint, paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system. ---  --- I'm not planning on any more children, but I don't dare part with these bottles yet.  They are stored in my basement for future use, either my myself or family members.  They also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze	pos
I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack-n-Play on the market.  When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play.  The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned.  The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old.  She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings.  She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption! ---  --- And, best of all, it is so much bigger than the other Pack N Plays.  There is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys.  The set up and take down is super easy... all four sides break-down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle.  I am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the Pack N Play.  I never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up. ---  --- Overall, I can't say enough WONDERFUL things about this product!  I'd put it on the new parent's "must have" list for sure	pos
This game takes place on a group of islands twenty years after the events of Chrono Trigger.  This game also takes place between two parallal worlds hence the name Chrono CROSS.  In this game you have the ability to recruit up to 44 characters.  To get all of them you will need to play through the game at least 3 times.  You will probably WANT to play the game more times anyway depending on how long it takes you understand the story line considering it is VERY complex. ---  --- I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who doesn't like RPG's or long games.  It took me at least 50+ hours to get through the game the first time, and that was with the guide book!!!  If you plan on getting this game I would also suggest the guide book for it as well.  Because there are somethings you would not find for the life of you unless you had something telling where to go and what to do.  For example some of the characters 7th level tech skills are impossible to find and get without the book.  You can find the Chrono Cross Guide on Amazon as well, but beware it usually isn't cheap. ---  --- If you liked any of the Final Fantasy games you would probably like this game as well.   ---  --- Something else to keep in mind is that the battle system is somewhat different that any other game you don't use MP, you use what are called elements.  These take the place of magical attacks.  There is a down side to the elements though when you wish to change characters you must remove all the elements you had on that character so you can place them on another character.  This can be VERY TIME CONSUMING especially later in the game when you have lots of element slots to fill.  Beware you WILL HAVE to do this a lot.  But don't let that get you down.  This is an exellant game despite all that. ---  --- With all that being said I would highly recommend this game to any RPG fan. ---  --- Hope this review helps.	pos
When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff.  This DVD Recorder failed miserably.  No S-Video inputs in the rear so you have to run S-Video to the front panel (which my 2 year old loved to unplug).  Nice editing features if you have the time.  Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back).  I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it	neg
Had to give it one star BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LOWER. --- This printer was the answer to my printing dreams. For about three months, with LIGHT home use. Only fault at that time is it is LOUD. It will wake the dead. Which is OK, since the DEAD don't have to print things that often, this is the perfect printer for them... --- Other than noise, a faulty "load paper" error kept coming up. --- Then, the paper load went bad. It is very unreliable, and ink cartridges run out VERY QUICKLY and cost about 10 bucks a pop, --- Tonight, I'm trashing it. Buying ANOTHER printer tonight! --- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH	neg

Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings. ---  --- In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the "design" of the earring.  But after closer examination, I noticed that the "blue" stone was "very light blue". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your "own" eyes and not through fancy "photoshop" website with touchup/enhanced photos	neg
I am a fan of DBZ, I am a fan of Goten, I think Hercule is funny and I think #18 is hot. Yet this movie sucked! It was missing what makes DBZ so great: lots of action and a great plot. Broly is overused and this completely ruins him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken place after then, the fight would be a lot more interesting. ---  --- In short, if you want to see every DBZ movie, then rent it. If you insist on collecting the whole series, wait until Movie Collection #4 comes out	neg
We got this chair as a baby shower gift, which I registered for and absolutely love it!  I don't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about.  If used properly, this chair gives absolutely no problems.  The seat locks in at different levels, if it's not locked in, of course it will fall apart.   ---  --- The seat is easy to use, folds easily, and cleans easily.  We store it in our van (we have Stow-and-go storage) and it fits perfectly! ---  --- We've used it since my son, now 16 months, could sit up.  He lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn't budge...very safe.  The tray does snap off easily, and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it.  This doesn't bother me, since it's not a 'toy' and shouldn't be climbed on anyway.  The tray hasn't snapped off while in use, and hopefully won't!   ---  --- We've used this chair on both a chair, and the floor when seating was limited (like at family get togethers).  We haven't had any problems at all. ---  --- Anyway, I highly recommend it..	pos

I love Splenda and I love getting it in a big bag.  As a good ole Oklahoma girl, I live for my iced tea.  And my tea MUST be sweet, but sugar isn't an option.  So SPLENDA to the rescue.

The big bags are often out at our local grocery store, so finding them at Amazon with our Amazon PRIME takes care of that problem	pos
It's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there, but thank Halstead & co. for proving me wrong. I am happily pleased with their latest, and very eagerly awaited, effort. Instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on, say, OUT OF TUNE, they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically "it's good, everything's going just way OK..." It's happy. Maybe I'll hear a lyric later that says something else, but for those for whom music is the priority, you can't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop. Four and a half stars	pos
I would not reccomend this product. It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get. It took two weeks for us to get it. When caption said ships 5-7 days. Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken. Major pieces. When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it. I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg. they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks. Another mth. So  it took almost 2 mths to get this product. It is not worth the problems. Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what. Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white. I called the company and they said this is true.	neg
I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.   ---  --- Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let us take a critical look at ourselves.  His characters have faults that we share.  Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and direction.  The problem with "Interiors" is that most of us could not relate to the problems that the characters in "Interiors" have.  Many of them belong under the category of mental illness while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to us.  Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by Ingar Bergman.  Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie and we have been the better for it.   ---  --- Taken in its' own right, "Interiors" is an above-average movie.  The acting is excellent and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner.  The movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess.  These people deserve themselves and that is an observation that applies to no other Woody Allen cast (with the bumbling exception of the cast of "What's New Pussycat?").   ---  --- Woody Allen took a turn towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way.  Fortunately, he learned from his experience. 	pos

Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta? --- It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs	neg

I would have to agree with the problem of the dividers to separate the dates, it just doesn't work. I didn't send it back because it really goes with my desk and I do like the two small drawers.

By the title I would be led to believe that there is more than one George story. There is one George and a few others, one of which scares my 2 1/2 year old. I thought the stories would be animated.

  This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see? ---    I think that, really, most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about BOOKS.  When I was little, my dad read me "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" and "The Hobbit"; things like that.  So, naturally, I loved books and stories.  This is practically the only movie I've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere.  It's obvious that the filmmakers themselves (or at least, a lot of the people working on it) actually like to read.  THAT'S really why I like the Pagemaster. ---  ---      So, if you like to read, watch this movie.  If you don't (you utter nincompoop), stay away, and don't criticize what you have no comprehension of	pos

I got Norton Ghost with my new Dell PC, so I thought I would use it for backups to an external USB drive. After about 6 months of 'trying' to use it, I finally gave up and uninstalled it. Reason, most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it. Twice I removed all the partial backups and started from scratch, but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup. ---  --- Now, the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image, but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups	neg

Forget the nit-picky comments you may read here, if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album, buy it!

I subscribed to Hobby Farm and after reading two issues I cancelled it.  ---  --- I read an article in the March/April issue about show birds. Then, I got my May/June issue. Don Schrider, the Communication Director of ALBC, wrote in to correct the story. The article claimed "over 1000" birds at the show, the correction was 11,640 birds were present. The other correction was regarding earlobe color and egg shell color stating there are exceptions to the red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs.   ---  --- In the Mar/Apr issue I read an article about Guinea hens. In the May/June issue I read another letter from a reader (Dana Manchester a member of the Guinea Fowl Breeders Assoc.) correcting the article in the previous issue. Apparently, Guineas aren't the "watch fowl" they are portrayed to be, but fall victim to predation often. Dana Manchester also corrected the mislabeled photos of Guineas.  ---   --- These may be small errors but how goods is a resource that isn't reliable? ---   --- If errors were the only issues, I may have given the mag 3 stars but the article on manure management in the May/June issue was lacking on many levels. The advise in a nutshell was buy a manure spreader that you can pull around your field, fill'er up and drive. One word of caution according to the article- only use well rotted manure in the garden, but there wasn't one word on how to rot manure.   ---  --- I liked the article about smaller breeds of cattle, "Bigger is Not Better" May/June but we'll have to wait for the next issue to see if any readers step forward with corrections.  ---  --- I am not waiting around.  ---  --- There are a lot books and magazines dedicated to small farms. I like Mother Nature News and I just subscribed to Countryside (my nephew recommended it he owns a small farm, as well). I also like John Seymour's book Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It. He has an upbeat attitude with a can-do spirit.	neg
"I have been a Brickman fan since the very first album. Much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much "electronic enhancement." Escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums.

The bottom of the controller sticks out quite a bit, but this does not affect gameplay and other than that it is the same size as the regular gamecube controller. Simply fantastic (unless you're one of those people that just NEED to have rumble for some reason). ---  --- But one slight problem: Is it just me, or do the trigger buttons occasionally fail? For example, in Resident Evil 4, I'll be holding the R button to aim, but it will quickly go back and forth from normal view, as if the button cancels out. However, this is rare, and maybe it's just me. ---  --- Once again, an excellent high-quality controller	pos

This horn set is a good deal at the Amazon price, and with no sales tax and free shipping, it is about $8 cheaper than the local auto store. I purchased this as the second replacement for a Toyota 4Runner. The compressors tend to rust since they are exposed to water kicked up from roads. This compressor looks better sealed, so that might make it last longer. Most Japanese cars come with weak horns, and this set makes up for them. They tend to scare the unwary (a good thing). The installation is straight-forward, but does require connecting electrical wires and mounting the relay, compressor and horns. To keep it simple, I tapped off the existing horn wire, ran a ground wire to an existing screw and used existing holes in the body panels	pos

Someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size.  Well, that person isn't alone.  The camera I purchased is a Canon S2is, which I love.  The lense doesn't fit it.  I even bought the hood/lense adapter set and it STILL doesn't fit.  This simply is NOT the right lense for a Canon S2is, no matter what Amazon suggests.  Now, too much time has passed for me to return the lense.  I'm stuck with it, and I don't like that	neg
I love these earrings!  They are simple yet elegant.  What's really great about them is that for a change I can wear long earrings without feeling that my ear is being pulled to the ground!!	pos
Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release. ---  --- The point? Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me. Like a good souffle, it was better the first time. ---  --- Indeed, inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch. And guess what turned out to be Jarre's next project?  ---  --- Whoops! Writer's block, perchance? ---  --- Olly Buxto	neg
I purchased this to display MPEG movies (which it says it can). I was told by tech support that I had to use a DIVX encoder and that they must be AVI (which is also incorrect). The SANYO Xacti video camera I was using was MPEG-4 (The iPod accepts the files without issue), I tried converting them in Quicktime to several different types of MPEG4 and none worked. There are better frames out there and I intend on finding out which one is the best. I have ordered another brand and will see if it works. This was by FIRST product return on Amazon.	neg
Superior to the first Steppenwolf album in many ways, and including a song that tops even 'Born To Be Wild' itself, 'Magic Carpet Ride', is as essential as the group's first album, even to the casual rock fan. ---  --- It opens with 'Faster Than The Speed Of Life', a perfect blend of Steppenwolfish hard rock & Airplanesque psychedelic rock (like 'She Has Funny Cars'). --- 'Tighten Up Your Wing' is an upbeat, bluesy track, that bounces well along, before being replaced with 'None Of Your Doing', a Steppenwolf-classic, that shifts gear between verse & chorus. --- 'Spiritual Fantasy' is one of the strangest creations on the album, strangely touching, though appaling at first. But given a second chance, it comes across as one of the best tracks on the album. --- The marihuana-anthem 'Don't Step On The Grass, Sam' is pure heavy Steppenwolf, a timeless classic, that crunches slowly, but steadily along. --- '28' is a great rock song with just a hint of psychedelia in the melody. A neat little rocker that is followed by the ultimate psychedelic dance track. --- 'Magic Carpet Ride' is simply Steppenwolf's best song ever, a fantastic blend of rhytm, melody & vision, that is worth the price of all Steppenwolf's classic albums on its own. It was also the only of their singles to almost replicate 'Born To Be Wild's US #2 placing, when it shot to #3 on the US chart. --- 'Disappointment Number' is almost that, but then not again. It is an odd ode to/parody of old blues, complete with bird sounds in the background, as if it's an old blues singer sitting out in the open. --- 'Lost And Found By Trial And Error' has a great tune, and rocks away well, as does 'Hodge, Podge, Strained Through A Leslie' and 'Resurrection'. Both employ the classic Steppenwolf sound in a great rocking way, to become, if not classics, then at least Steppenwolf-standards. --- The album closes with 'Reflections' a weird song, that seems like somebody trying to be visionary, before you realize that that is just what he is. Just in a very peculiar way. ---  --- The album has some, if not weak, then not too powerful spots, but generally it is a more than worthy follow-up to the first Steppenwolf album, with a great blend of the band's traditional hard rock and a form of psychedelia that suits them perfectly. Even the least interesting tracks rock nicely, & no-one should have anything to complain about here..	pos

my review is written here only for seekers of obscure nine inch nails songs. for a full review of the soundtrack in its entirety read elsewhere-there are many other reviews. --- i have all 19 halos, and exclusive and unreleased remixes and demos, and i love all of it, including the entirety of the fragile, fixed, perfect drug versions, still, further down the spiral v1 and v2, the deluxe edition of the downward spiral, on and on, everything.... --- except deep. --- deep is truly the only nine inch nails song not worth having. --- painfully uninspired and recycled, musically, lyrically, and visually (the video was an embarassment- again, the only one in a catalogue of otherwise disturbing, beautiful brilliance), DEEP is a song and phase trent himself has admitted to wishing to forget entirely. --- my advice: take it as a mark that he is, after all, human, but leave it here on the tomb raider soundtrack, unpaid for, for it will never show up on an official halo as burn (originally for natural born killers), dead souls (joy division cover originally for the crow), and the perfect drug (originally for lost highway) all have in time (the former two on halo 8 DE and the latter on halos 11, 12, and 15 in extended form)	neg
El Yucateco hot sauces are great. I've been enjoying the red and green for a long time. I also tried the other ones, the Carribean which is good, and the Habanero Extra Hot sauce is exactly what its called, it is hotter than all the others. I think the best El Yucateco I've tried was the Chipotle one, which sadly is not included. Overal El Yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor	pos

These noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old, she bonks herself with them. My toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them.

Complete waste of money!  I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it!  After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed.

Looked nice at the store. Thought the adjustable head rest was a nice touch...until we got home and tried to use it. The head rest will not stay stuck down on the mat, the velcro is not strong enough. I would not buy this product again	neg
This game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	pos

I was recommended this product for my son's hair and have had many recommendations over the years, since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy.

I've been doing game dev for a number of years now, and it's like a breath of fresh air to come upon a book like this. Clearly written, well organized, and a breeze to read through!

I have this product working in my hair right now. It is simply wonderful!  ---  --- First off, it smells like lovely Victorian rosebud-almond pudding. It has a similar consistency. I can get about three to four uses from each container and I have very thick hair.  ---  --- My hair was preciously quite dry and abused. I had dyed it twice in the last six months. After ONE use of this product my hair felt better than it had in YEARS. Silky, strong and shiny. I love this product! I highly recommend it.	pos
 I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true.  ---  My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster.  ---  One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me. ---  I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none. --- 	pos
The synopsis ... --- Sam and Jonah Baldwin, father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer.  Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad; and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife.  Annie Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter.  Their relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of romantic sparks.  When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by "magic" and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across "like 26 states". ---  --- The critique ... --- Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly simple film; that's what makes it so great.  To quote Nora Ephron, "It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the movies."  To emphasize this point, she incorporates various parallel references to "An Affair to Remember" throughout the film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which, let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on the silver screen).  The script is refreshingly candid, yet endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable.  Ross Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable talent in the film.  He does an excellent job of portraying THE quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks he knows it all.  (I speak from experience here folks; I currently have a son that age.)  He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be utterly convincing off screen.  The chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann.  Families with younger children will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul language ("God damn it" and " ... it scared the shit out of me ..." being the worst of it) and no "sexual content" to be wary of.  All around, this is a winning film.  One that I find myself watching over and over and over again. ---  --- The DVD ... --- For a 10th Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather disappointing.  You've got your basic director commentary, a music video ("When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion & Clive Griffin), and a "Love in the Movies" Featurette.  This last piece is approximately 15 minutes long.  It features the director, producers, actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about "Love in the Movies."  There are some interesting interview segments with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly nothing here to write home about.  By far, the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio.  (And honestly, how exciting is that?)  This a DVD that you buy for the film alone.       	pos
I have owned the video for several years and just purchased the DVD.  Hannah and Her Sisters far exceeds Anne Hall as my favorite Allen picture.  Such a joy.  And the DVD is wonderful	pos
Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a "new" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge.	neg

I think his debut had the best lyrics. This joint gets off to a good start with We Still Party and pretty much bangs till the end. His production on here is best described as "Late 90's Roger Troutman-esque G-Funk".  --- Geust Stars like 2nd II NOne, AMG, Suga Free and El Debarge get their shine on. ---  --- Top Joints: --- We Still Party  (Peter Gunz and Quik on the track) Quik jacks the VERB song from School House Rock. (The Jam) --- So Many Wayz   --- Hand In Hand  --- You'z A Ganxta  (Quik refutes rumors that he was involved in Biggie's demise.

There aren't many games now-a-days that can get me interested enough to play regularly, but Dominions 2 is one that definitely does. ---  --- It's a multiplayer, multi-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux), turn-based strategy game. There is a tun of different strategies to go with, many nations, magic items, spells, different units. Excellent game for a hardcore strategy person. ---  --- The only drawback is the interface. It's certainly not perfect and takes a bit to get used to. But there is lots of documentation online to help with that kind of stuff. ---  --- I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good multiplayer turn-based strategy. It's the best I've ever played (and I've played quite a few	pos

I also got this disgusting subscription "invoice" from these jerks. I don't care HOW GOOD A MAGAZINE IS, if someone has to use deceptive, threatening and totally bogus marketing practices to ensnare new subscriptions, their magazine should not be rewarded with anyone's business. I never ordered or got a single issue of their rag. Only a repeating smack in the face via mailbox claiming I am going to be "referred to a collection agency."  KIDS Discover, you will NEVER get a cent out of me. Last time I checked we still live in a land where we don't have to pay for what we never got. If you spent as much time working on a good magazine for kids as you do sending out fake bills, you would have enough subscribers you wouldn't have to Shanghai any new ones with your fraudulent billing scam.	neg
I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off.

I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy	neg
I grew up reading Fangoria, when I could sneak it past my parents, that is.  Fangoria Magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article.  Now you are not always going to agree with everything they say, but you can always expect them to be honest.  When a horror icon is not performing up to snuff, like Stephen King or John Carpenter, they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws.  Fangoria also has the Chainsaw Awards, where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie, actor, ect, and you can also submit a name for Horror Hall of Fame (my guy has yet to win it).  They also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the Japanese and Italian horrors (wow, they can make some splatter flicks), and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater.  And they have pictures.  All the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s).  This is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan, I whole heartedly recomend it	pos

She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment	neg
This magazine is my dream magazine. I subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store.

As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.	neg

We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years.  With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology.  Oops.  It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor.  And the annoying beeping was the clincher.  I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear.  Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..	neg

Based on negative reviews, either I've been knitting too long to still have good sense, or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine. It is my favorite, and I do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters. I found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues (a reviewer didn't find any in a couple years of issues). Re Zimmerman-type designs, you can make any sweater in one or two pieces, change gauge, needle sizes, yarns, etc. Search Websites to give you the basics for free. After 2 years of crochet, I learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles, found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain, fancy, Aran, Jacquard, sideways or you-name-it. I like Knit 'N Style. Thanks for reading this	pos
The computer that I bought June 2006 came with Nero 6 OEM version.  It has worked very well.  I finally got around to clicking on the upgrade icon and ordered what I thought would be a serial number to unlock some features.  It turns out that is not available, and I have bought the Nero 7 Ultra version, which required a 195 MB download. Having dialup, I was not pleased.  I asked for my money back.  No response.  I faxed BBB complaint with copies to Nero offices in California and Germany. The office in Germany responded with email that they do not do refunds. Los Angeles BBB has been unresponsive.  --- I finally got the download from a computer with broadband. I uninstalled Nero 6 and set restore point.  I installed Nero 7.  It worked!  But it was agonizingly slow.  I don't mean the CD or DVD writing per se was slow. When I eventually got it going that gave me the full speed of my hardware. However navigating from each click to response felt like it was in a 486 and not an Athlon 64.  I think other programs were also rendered more sluggish in opening files. --- I uninstalled Nero 7, and just to be safe I then used restore point from before I installed it. I reinstalled Nero 6. What a relief!  There may be some fancy features Nero 6 OEM lacks, but it's worth it to have the computer working at reasonable speed. If I want to rip a music track to a .wav file (a feature lacking in the OEM version), it's easier to reboot to linux and run K3b than put up with sluggish Nero 7 Ultra to do it. ---  --- A product and company gone bad; Nero 7 is definitely not recommended	neg
This is the second product of Jonathan's I've used and I'm equally happy with it.  I have thin hair when it's straight, and something in the middle when it's curly.  Either way, I'd like it thicker, and this foam certainly helps.  It's great and I've found it does what it promises.  It smells good and you don't need to use too much.

This book captures the human spirit, at both its best and its worst.  Schwarz-Bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of Ernie Levy, from birth and on.  He also, shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the Nazi movement.  It is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the Jewish people.  It is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a Just Man, although without them humanity would crumble, as future readers will find out their importance.  And if there really are Just Men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders	pos

This book is so awesome!!! It has so much great info in it. It is a book that is so easy to read before you know it your done. It makes you really think about your relationship prior affair and after affair. What went wrong and were it went wrong at.

It has a questionnaire at the end that both partners can do and an agreement for both partners to read and sign. It helps lift your spirit and makes you think that this isnt the end of the world and that you can make it through. I have a new found hope for my marriage and a new attitude towards everything. I am looking at the bigger picture and the brighter side of things. I am alive and I still have my family and my husband.

I am a Time person of the year 2003 (shared title - actively deployed U.S. servicemembers).  I must say that reading Time magazine is like reading the platform for the Democratic Party.  Actually it is even worse than that it is like reading John Dean's diary, filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality.  One of the latest from the online edition is that Realists have taken over Washington.  Give me a break.  A new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it.  Anyone who believes Nancy Pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help America is a fool.  Best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in Washington.  Maybe then they will see that America improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful. ---  --- The sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world.  This publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have "learned". ---  --- If you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the Economist.  It probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others.  The Economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence.  The articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about. ---  --- Leaders from around the world read and contribute to the Economist.  This is something that Time, Newsweek and the rest of their ilk cannot claim. ---  --- I am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political.  I look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly	neg
This "pillow" is an inflated "U" that fits around your neck. One of the problems is, it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck. This can get pretty irritating the longer you use it. ---  --- Fortunately, it is dirt cheap, so then I guess you get what you pay for. --- 	neg

Maybe mine was broken, but I don't think so because I could see a red light at all the cable ends. I connected the splitter to my sound card, a TB Montego DDL, with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo. No signal whatever. Both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card. I even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad. Still no signal. ---  --- I think you need to have either a very, very, strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one, or use a powered splitter. --- 	neg

This is, by far, the most comfortable pair of unders I've ever worn. Over the years, I've gone with boxers and with briefs, and in the boxers vs. briefs contest, both are losers compared to the Contour Thong. There's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support. The Contour Thong has a Y thong back, and you don't need to have the body of an International Male/Undergear model to wear these. For any guy with an open mind, I recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try	pos

This shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright, shiny hair for me. I have nice hair to begin with (if I do say so myself), but I used this in conjunction with one of Lush's conditioners(American Cream)and my friends told me I had shampoo model hair that day. I'm not crazy about the beer-ish smell,which is why I'll give it a four rating.However, it doesn't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it	pos
This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow  the dozen or so chambers up.  The instructions were terrible.  You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next.  The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all.  My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again	neg

We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off.

Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves	neg
The Bushnell Powerview 12x25 is a fine, small pocket-sized binocular.  Since my wife is an avid bird watcher, we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power.  Our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 Bushnell that we used for trips, so I researched, then bought this one from Amazon for her birthday.  She loves it.  The viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact, which makes it easy to pack for vacations, yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country.  We both highly recommend this, and other Bushnell products	pos
 --- Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout (along with partner Emilio Estevez) of pretty Madeleine Stowe (they have to watch her house through the night), and he falls in love with her. Before the movie is over there's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer (Aidan Quinn). It's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie, but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and Dreyfuss's performance is right on target. A very entertaining movie; definitely worth a watch	pos
We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk	neg

This product is listed as "Limited Edition Special Packaging" at a cost of $30.99.  It's nothing but an ordinary CD in a plastic jewel case with a "Made In Hong Kong" sticker on the back.  It's the import version.  There's nothing "special" about the packaging.  Save your money and get the domestic version for $14. ---  --- The album itself is awesome by the way.  Nick Cave continues to make fantastic albums.  Even though I feel ripped-off by Amazon's inaccurate advertising I must say this album is totally worth having.  This is raw and noisy.  It's removed from the introspective albums that Nick Cave has produced with the Bad Seeds recently but is better conceived than any Birthday Party record ever was.  It's not The Bad Seeds. It's not The Birthday Party.  It's GRINDERMAN! ---  --- To be fair, I asked Amazon to refund the price difference between this misleading product and the domestic version, the difference being about $17..  They agreed and I got my refund in no time.  Thanks Amazon, great customer service	neg
After reading several comments I tried to proof my scale is working properly. However, like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant. I weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings. Like some one else I even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands.

The "sticky" pads that are supposed to hold the organizer don't even stick, so every morning I would wake up to find the organizer sitting in a pile on the floor next to the changing table...and this was with absolutely NO items in it.

The Great Outdoors Deluxe Smoker is exactly what I was looking for.  The LP gas is great for easy temperature control.  All I need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of  liquid in the pan (and add more wood chunks if desired).  The temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality.  The only complaint I have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped.  Thus, my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker.  They do not affect the operation at all.	pos
I recently bought one of these for our 18-month-old son.  The piano arrived in fine shape.  The piano and bench are sturdy and well made when you put them together properly.  The sound is just like I remember a toy piano should sound.  Notes are not perfectly in tune like a fine instrument, but tuned within reason to the notes of the scale, including sharps and flats.   Most importantly, our little boy just loves playing this piano.  Hopefully it will inspire him to continue and so it is as great an introdroduction to music as any other toy, including the electronic toys, we have purchased for him.  I also liked that he wasn't able to pull off the keys try as he may.  They just kind of become locked when he trys to do that and can be put back in place by minor adjstment. 	pos
This game has stunning graphics and fast-paced gameplay. This game is simply killing different bosses over and over again, but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is. For example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them. Some a lot more complicating than others. And theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all. So overall this game is great	pos

I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into. ---  --- Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake. ---  --- I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly	neg

I "upgraded" to NORTON'S 2006 Version of Internet Security and Virus Protection software online. Included was Norton SystemWorks. I have used Norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems. And yes, I always remove my previous version, before adding new software. Even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna, it took almost two hours for the product to download and install.  Then when I rebooted my laptop (a new high-end Sony Vaio with Windows XP), it froze up during startup. I won't go into all the hassle involved, but after THREE removals and downloads over a period of several weeks, it became apparent that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with NORTON'S 2006 Product. It caused crashes on almost a daily basis, and updates always took an excessive amount of time. Customer service was no help at all, and the company refused to refund my purchase price. I've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer. After this experience, I will NEVER use NORTON products again. The only reason I gave this a 1-star rating is because it's the lowest rating available. It should actually be MINUS 5 STARS for the aggravation and time and money wasted	neg
My eight-month-old daughter really loves these instruments! We bought them when she was about four months old, but when she picked them up she'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around.

This book provides a fine introduction to the myths of Northern Europe.  The book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose, written by Christian writers after the fact - the Eddas, Beowulf, and the Viking sagas.  From these sources, especially the Edda, the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the Norse gods and their subsequent twilight in Ragnarok.  Then, the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the Northern European peoples.  The figures of Odin, Thor, Loki, Balder, and the rest of the Norse gods play an important part in our European cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here.  Whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of Ragnarok (the Twilight of the Gods) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race, as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature.  Ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the Christian worldview.  Whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by Christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried, you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand Northern Europe in pre-Christian times.  Finally, it must be noted that in many ways, at least in my opinion, the society of the Vikings was superior to our own.  I admire the strong sense of individualism that the Vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats	pos

You can't go wrong buying this great grill.  It was a snap to put together with easy to follow instructions.  It heats up super fast and cooks with wonderful efficency.

Buyer beware. These new Journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases. They are NOT remastered in 2006. Rhino should be ashamed of itself for this (it's been 10 years - I would have gladly paid for a remastered version, but not for new packaging)	neg
Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats.  I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat	neg
Believe the good reviews written here about this film. I havent cared much thus far for the movies Penn has directed after this one, I suppose its because I feel this is such a great film, he created a tough act to follow, but even if he never does top it, he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time. I like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas. But overall this is a great movie, with great performances by all, and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over. Im not easily touched by most movies, but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits.  Its without a doubt one of my favorite films. This is the kind of film that reminds you, movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art	pos

I have trouble judging distances and this is our co-toy now! ---  --- The battery went dead too soon. We called Sky Golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste.

I had to return my 1st order due to mould on the wood (around the joins) and inside the glass front. My replacement has a little mould inside the glass front, but I decided I could live with it.. I blame Amazon's storage for this rather than the manufacturing of it by LaCrosse. ---  --- The glass front is spherical, so tends to get weird light reflections, so watch for this when you are hanging it. ---  --- Note that when the battery is low, the second hand will move in 2 second jumps to let you know that the battery is low - this is a feature, not a problem, which I like. ---  --- Other than that it works great! (I live close to Boulder and NIST, where the radio signal comes from, so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks).	pos

I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play. ---  --- The 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing, so I wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable) ---  --- The volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so I don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings I like to use when not using headphones.  Makes it real nice too when using an instructional CD or DVD i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head. ---  --- Very light weight.  Some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'.  Fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere.   ---  --- Cord enters headphones on the left ear side, so you don't have to deal with the classic 'Y' split cord.  Easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way. ---  --- Earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching, gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the TV, rather loudly, which is right next to me and I bairly notice it). Plenty of padding around the ear pieces.   Many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear, but these headphones I honestly don't feel anything against my ears.  Even after several hours of use each night. ---  --- Sound quality.  Bose or pioneer they are not, but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :) --- That being said they are very good for sound.  Sounded very good on a portable CD player. ---  --- Only drawbacks I can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads.  The inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4.  IMO they could have been made bigger. --- Also, if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears. ---  --- I have a head like Drew Carry ( give you an idea head size/shape I'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit. ---  --- I wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere, bind, pinch or anything like that with my glasses. ---  --- So, I highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( I don't recomend things often :) ) ---   ---  ---     ---  --- 	pos
Owning 2 mercedes, it is a pain to drain normally.  Using the MityVac, you insert the hose, pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil.  My only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid.  The resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum.  Still, it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it. ---  --- I also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use.  It was a real time saver on the differential since I did not have to break the gasket for the cover	pos
Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace.  My significant other did the same.  I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty.  Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly.  I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences.  I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early.  Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this "candy")	neg
I just bought my first laptop computer and really, really hated the touchpad. I found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain. ---  --- I spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number. ---  --- I am very happy that I did too. Its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile - definately well made. Im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands - I find this mouse comfortable to use. It looks pretty cool too, the red panels on the side light up, which is always good for night work. All the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month. I couldnt ask for better all round performance. And for $20 you really cant go wrong, it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse. The only reason I dont give it five stars?? Well this is technology - although it is a awesome piece of kit, there are always other things or features they could have added	pos
This is the 6th and last entry in the series Lone Wolf & Cub.  This one not only has a different director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous comic book series). --- Not that that is bad. ---  --- The whole series fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not taking itself too seriously.  It was at once graphic and fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable,  factual and imaginary. serious & silly.  That's what made it so damn interesting.   ---  --- Throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of Japan.  Tracing actual historical roads and cities.  Now we end the series in the mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title. ---  --- This entry has a lot of stuff going on:  Lord Retsudo of the hated Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter to do in Ogami with her "Falling Dagger" technique. When, predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe.   ---  --- The downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad.  That Ogami's Baby Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them, behead them, or run em through.  Red sprays all over the white snow. ---  --- Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang.  One of the strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced anywhere.  Worth it if you don't mind the violence	pos

I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.   ---  --- It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably.  ---  --- Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless. 	neg

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product	neg
This is the worst book of Shakespeare criticism I have ever read.  Bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next.  It reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend.  He contradicts himself several times.  I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier.  To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts HIMself.  He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30.  Apparently the point is that if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom.  Bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker.  He has not grown up yet.  That is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom.  Some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes.  Interespersed between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived.  Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying	neg
The DAVA technology is my favored type in all situations. The combination of a flexible center and a rigid playing surface is wonderful. In addition, the pick surface is textured to enable a better grip with wet or dry fingers. DAVA is the only brand of picks I use and each type suits my every need. I whole heartedly recommend them to anyone.	pos
For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work.	neg

I bought this to go with my MS2-200BPT Shaver. I saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well. I've been using it for about 1 month and I couldn't agree more. A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new. I can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since I've started using it. As a bonus, it seems to last quite a while. Another strong product from Remington	pos
I just read Doug's review of "First Man into Space" and I just had to write respond.  I was seven years old when I saw this movie. As I recall (though my recollection here may be faulty), it was double-billed with "Tom Thumb."  One of my good friends had a birthday party and we all went to the movies.  "First Man into Space" scared the bejeezus out of us. We were so scared we couldn't stop crying. They had to take us out of the movie in the middle--sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper.  I thus never saw its conclusion. A few years ago I found the video of the movie and I triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers. Needless to say, they made fun of me throughout the movie: "Dad, you were scared by this?!" :-	neg

I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read.  By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore.  There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic.  At the end of every issue there were pictures of "real-life" wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine	neg

Ah, yes, it's Nirvana's "Nevermind" cd, released in 1991. I listen to all 80's pop-metal, or hair metal (Whitesnake, Winger, Van Halen, Y&T, Dokken) I could go on forever on 80's bands. (Of course there is Rick Springfield, and John Cougar Mellencamp). I am a true rocker here, I know all the true bands out there, I know everything about them. I have reasons for this. ---  --- But here's the bottom line. Nirvana was a breakthough along with Soundgarden and Pearl Jam back in the early 90's. Millions of people bought those cds. And yes, there were hair bands still alive back then, like Poison, and Firehouse, etc. Firehouse and Poison had alot of success, eventhough it wasn't the 80's anymore. ---  --- As I can see, alot of my fellow rockers don't really like Nirvana, or Pearl Jam, or Soundgarden. To be completely honest, I like their music, I just don't prefer the music, because I don't like the hard sound. I really like the glam-hair band style. ---  --- People say: "Nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam-metal". Yes, I agree that they killed the 80's hair bands, but it's not necessarly their fault. It's a mix between the bands, and the people listenting to the music. Because of grundge music, today's music is quite horrifying, with EMO and other types of music that would've been a nightmare back in those days. ---  --- Nirvana has a great CD here, but I just don't prefer it. If you are a REAL rocker, you'll listen to all the types of music back then. Don't judge unless you have actually heard it, because you may actually like it. ---  --- To all rockers- Don't listen to modern music. It's poisoning our people, and no one really understands the true meaning of "the guitar" in today's music. Most of you will understand what I mean, so listen to the classics. ---  --- Classic rock, and hair bands forever, and even grunge. Keep the classic alive. ---  --- ~The Sicilian Axe Ma	pos

I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).  ---  --- What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. The mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a "portable" system	neg

Gerd Ludemann writes, "historical research shows with definite clarity that Jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax", (190). A summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support. ---  --- Three streams of thought permeate "The Resurrection of Christ": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; Peter and Paul experienced hallucination and "vision" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. Each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-Christian polemic.  ---  --- In his chapter "Translation and analysis of the Early Christian texts on the Resurrection", Ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles "purpose and tradition reworked" (re. Gospel writers), and "historical elements". In the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. For example, Ludemann asserts that we may conclude that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Jewish Council (which condemned Jesus), but that Mark (earliest gospel) "likely" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of God and had become a disciple of Jesus. But Ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record Joseph as the rich council member that buried Jesus in his own tomb. Ludemann's case will be much weaker if Jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. Ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to "disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial" of Jesus. This is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. Ludemann goes so far as to accuse Matthew, Mark and Luke of being anti-Jewish! (Refer to the ridiculous Appendix 3). ---  --- Is Christianity a "history of self deception"? Ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on Ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of Jesus available in the New Testament. That any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. Ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 Corinthians 15 is the New Testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of Jesus' multiple appearances. Even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's AD. The discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. Also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of Jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! Ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. What accounts for these hallucinations? "Peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning" (165). Paul's "event had a character of light and, like the vision of John, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy" (47). But Paul does not report "I was in the Spirit" as John does (see Revelation 1). John is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. Paul is not. When Paul does have opportunity to convey an actual "in the spirit" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 Corinthians 12:2). So we have record of Paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. Ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages "modern depth psychology" to explain Paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of Christians to "Apostle-in-Chief of a new program of salvation" (170-171). So, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of Paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of Jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances!  ---  --- Ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. Historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. Yet Ludemann writes, "Who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin" (201). This is rife with misunderstanding. One need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  Also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. Yet Ludemann quotes another author, "[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time." (175). This ignores the New Testament textual evidence that initially Jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. Even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle!  ---  --- Ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with Paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon Christianity. Sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. Self deluded by a proliferation of "one can imagine", "seems to indicate", "likely enough", and "one thus suspects" reasoning, Ludemann boasts "accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision". (210). May the reader decide otherwise	neg

Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things: dancing, dressing, and reading sensational novels. But doing these things won't get you a husband, or acquaint you with other young ladies, such as yourself. So, upon request from a neighbor, Catherine is invited to spend some time in Bath - a fashionable town, where Catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature, who are not related to her. And that is where the naive Catherine meets up with the Thorpe family. Quickly becoming friends with Isabella Thorpe, Catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious, yet conniving family. And it is only when Catherine is rescued by Henry Tilney, along with his charming sister, Eleanor, and whisked off to their ancestral home, known only as Northanger Abbey. There, Catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories, that is - comes back to haunt her; for Northanger Abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking, and frightening winds, that leave Catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. The fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors, and a curious history only heightens young Catherine's suspicions, and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within Northanger Abbey, and the Tilney family, in general. ---  --- Jane Austen has been a favorite of mine since I was very young, but it was not until this past weekend that I happened upon NORTHANGER ABBEY while browsing through the bookstore, and decided to purchase it. I will admit that, hands down, this has become one of my favorite Austen books. Catherine is an enchanting character, whose innocence, and naivete make her charming from beginning to end; while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers. Catherine's interactions with Isabella Thorpe, and the rest of the Thorpe family are intrepid, and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters; while the charming Henry Tilney - like Mr. Darcy - makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman, and our young heroine. A wonderful, satirical piece of fiction, that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an Austen fan. ---  --- Erika Sorocco --- Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape	pos
Contrary to the previous review, the majority of the patterns in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue were normal sizes (5'6").  This particular issue contains 10 jackets (two of which were for petites), four skirts (one of them petite), three pants (one petite), and four shells (two petites).  There were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves.  The interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent.  This particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa.  The pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes, very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer.  One thing I did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear.  The magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions. 	pos
I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.  My PC has suddenly become more entertaining and useful.  With this remote, the time I spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced. ---  --- In my 860 sq ft APT, the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft.  The remote has always worked from anywhere in the APT thru 2 walls. I was surprised to get this much range. I have not yet found a spot from which it doesn't work.  To get the best range BE SURE to position the USB RF receiver near the computer as directed. ---  --- With my PC, I'm always playing music.  I also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the Internet.  I have a good graphics card with S-Video TV out.  I got a 50 ft S-Video/Out cable; this connects my PC and TV which are in different rooms.   ---  --- With this remote, I now can play (and control) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo (which is connected to the TV) without being at my PC or be in the same room as my PC.  Also, with this remote, any video that can be played on my PC, (online streaming or local) I can watch and control it (pause, rewind, slow motion, next, FWD) on my TV.   ---  --- My PC/TV has effectively become a powerful media center--Media center PC not needed.    ---  --- There is so much more...  with the remote, I use the mouse from far away (lying in bed or on the couch); there a numerous ways to get creative with this. ---  --- I wish the remote was lighted. Still, the keys are arranged for "touch typing" so to speak.  Another negative, I've noticed that Windows Media Player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote.	pos

Theodore B. Taylor, the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004, but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester.  Even though the text of this book originally appeared in "The New Yorker" in 1973, Taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation.  McPhee has a very understated style ("just the facts, ma'am"), but this book is still the most frightening I've ever read.  I can't decide whether I would want him to write a sequel, because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973.  Just ask yourself the following questions: ---  --- Is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973?  Yes. ---  --- Do more nations have nuclear capability?  Yes. ---  --- Can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart?  Yes. ---  --- Are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973?  Yes. ---  --- Do some people hate America even more than they did in 1973?  Decide this one for yourself. ---  --- John McPhee, staff writer for the "New Yorker" and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author of twenty-seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine, has written a nuclear explosion of a book in "The Curve of Binding Energy."    It's one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written.  Essentially, it's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand, along with a chunk of rather easily stolen U-235 or plutonium.  Theodore B. Taylor, himself the creator of smaller, more efficient nuclear bombs, tells us where to steal the plutonium, how to assemble a bomb, even gives hints on where to plant it--one of the eeriest parts of this book has Taylor and McPhee exploring the now-vanished towers of the World Trade Center, trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage. ---  --- "The Curve of Binding Energy" is a must read for every man, jack, and paper-pusher in the Department of Homeland Security, not to mention both houses of Congress.  I imagine the first reaction of many Congresspersons would be to ban this book, but it's way too late for that, my friend.	pos
This is a product that is dependent on constant upgrades because the most current version of the 2006 tax forms are often not available when it first comes out.  That is the nature of the product.   ---  --- However, for the third year in a row, many Macintosh users have run into problems with their automated online form upgrade process.  If the automated upgrade process does not work, you can do the upgrade manually, but that is a somewhat complex process.  Alternatively, you can order a snail mail version of the upgraded program, if you can ever get through to the phone number you have to call.  They always seem to be encountering a large volume of calls no matter what time you call.   ---  --- Its a great product once you get it upgraded to contain the most recent version of the forms.  I wonder if the automated upgrade process works for Windows users?  At any rate, until they fix the automated upgrade process, an important part of the software, I have to rate it as low as possible	neg

After years of searching I've finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla.

The next time I was in the lift, everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. After I applied a freshen up spray, another colleague said she could smell cakes! Yet another colleague demanded to know what I was wearing, and where she could get some.

This camera case is great.  It's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly.  There is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries (but the batteries make it tight).  I originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600, but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you aren't careful.  This camera case does not come with a strap like the other, but that is something I would never use.  I highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera. 	pos
Green bell peppers are very versatile; great for stuffed peppers, salads or sauteeing with Italian sausage.  I'm a big fan of all peppers, and would give most all peppers a high rating...I had to bump the bell pepper down a star for its low rating on the Scoville scale.  Bell peppers rate a 0 on this scale of hotness. Just a little bit of spiciness would make these peppers a definite 5-star vegetable, due to its versatility and delicious capsaicin taste...but alas, the bell pepper is void of that magical capsaicin, and thus a 4-star vegetable	pos

The body is clear and makes it easy to see how much ink is left through the windows in the pen body of the Safari and Joy.  With practice, I can now fill the converter with one hand, holding the converter body between my pinky and ring fingers and twist the plunger knob with my thumb and pointer finger.  This leaves my other hand free to tip the ink bottle, if necessary.  I've been using one of these converters for years, and they seem to last fine.  It's a simple device, but I can think of worse designs. ---  --- If you don't have the same pens as I do, see the Lamy site to see if the Z24 works with your Lamy	pos
Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls"	neg

This is a beautiful movie, but please have no misconceptions about what you're getting into.  It is not a traditional love story.  It does not have a happy ending. You are taken on an incredible journey, and grow to love these innocent people, who burn with passion--  then you see terrible, undeserved things happen to them.   ---  --- But it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting.  It is a story about the human costs of founding a nation, among many other thought-provoking things.  It was shamefully overlooked in 1998, and I do not understand why it has not been released on DVD.  I appeal to Fox Searchlight, please DVD this soon.	pos
Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis. ---  --- Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection. ---  --- Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free	neg
I got a bad batch and was sent another to try out. It was better but still not what I expected. On both, the pieces were very small for some reason.

I am an active 48 year old and I own a Vurtego Pro Pogo stick. I ride motocross and I mountain bike regulary and I like the exercise and fun factor it offers. I chose the Vurtego Pro after doing some online research and I am totally pleased with the performance. The guys who designed and developed the Vurtego Pro and Fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick. The Power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns.  For the money the Power Pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. It takes allot of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. I am pretty good at mine, after about a month of use I am getting up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two, a great workout! I have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks, I consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most. I doubt that I will ever reach the six foot level at my age, but that was never my goal. I know that the people at Vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable, high quality and durable stick. If your looking to go 6' and pull off serious stunts I would buy the orignal Vurtego Pro or the Fit model for a great workout. If you are looking for a little less I would wait for the next version that the  Vurtego people will offer and endorse. I personally would avoid this one.  	neg

I remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things:  ---  --- 1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE!  ---  --- 2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named "Alafair" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: "I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!"  ---  --- To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin & Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead. --- 	neg

What a great magazine - its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months - most of which are totally wearable. I really feel this mag. rides the line between fashionable and practical. I have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue. The directions could use a bit more description - sometimes the designers think you can read their minds, but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store won't fix. There are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep - something you wouldn't think was interesting, but then you start reading it and can't put it down.  --- Love the book reviews and ads - I ordered a DVD from one of the ads and am so, so happy with it. I also bought a book after reading the review and have been enjoying it. --- Keep in mind that these are "fashion models" and really try to picture your body in the item before you go spending a lot of time on a fitted tank that will make you look massive. --- I got this as a gift and will definitely be renewing my subscription when it ends.	pos
Initially a very good buy, however after only 3 days of very light use I had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk.... and I was in another room.  For the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case	neg
I bought this camera after my 3-year-old broke my kodak Z700. I  loved my Z700, even though it was only 4MP and didn't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have. I figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6MP would be a no-brainer, but I was disappointed in 2 major areas. First, the lag time is so slow on the C653, when I took pictures of my kids I rarely got what I was expecting to see. The smile or look that I saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures. We experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference. The other disappointing area was low-light picture quality. Anything I shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit. Every background was grainy. Terrible. Using the low-light settings fixed the problem, but then your subject is blurry because you're not in "Sports" or "Kids" mode anymore (which we used all the time with the Z700 for taking pics of the kids). On my Z700 (which is only $150 now), I could set it and forget it. Set it to "action", and it took perfect pics indoors, or out, moving or stationary. That's what I thought I was getting in the C653, but I was wrong. I ended up returning the camera	neg
Just returned from a trip to Hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test.  I was very pleased with the results.  This is a powerful lens, yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use.  I was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds, zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera (Canon EOS 20D) and virtually every shot was a keeper.  The IS feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus.  Usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one.   I shot in both portrait and landscape mode and I didn't see any problems with focus, clarity or sharpness.  All the images were clean and razor sharp.  If you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment, I highly recommend this lens for your arsenal.	pos
This is my very first experience with a trimmer.  I was aiming to the plastic made products with the replaceable cutters, but I recall my school had an old beat up trimmer and it seemed to still cut good.

Bob James - the mastermind of smooth Jazz. "H", "Touchdown", "Grand Piano Cannyon". Eternal pieces of Art. Brave and thoughtful new directions in Jazz. We owe him a lot. --- But the recent releases of Fourplay -including "X" - don't meet my expectations at all: predictable, repetitive, overproduced Computer-music. --- The typical Fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another CD.  --- Larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on "Tournabout" - but then the song falls back again to old routine. "Screenplay" is a good one (one of two songs that were done by Bob). The rest, hmm... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy. --- Don't get me wrong, I like all of the guys. Every single member of the group has done great things in the past.  --- So - a bit more breveness,  Yes Please	neg
This umbrella's quality belies its bargain price. It assembled easily and opens/closes smoothly. The construction seems sturdy, and the fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out of the shipping crate.

I'm overall quite pleased with the product and I'm looking for places in my yard to utilize more of these	pos
This is without a doubt the worste game I have ever purchased. It is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat. ---  --- They could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from. As it is right now it's just a really, really, really, crappy version of Zelda: Orcarina of Time. ---  --- If you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	neg
I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.  ---  --- I bought this tub only because my baby was out growing the fold away bath chair but it looks as though I will have to continue using it and buy a larger one for her. I was very temped to send it back but I'm just going to sell it on ebay.  ---  --- I'm sorry but it was a waste of money for me. I'm happy that it did aleast work out for the other moms, maybe mines is defected!	neg

In all honesty, I'd rate the fragrance itself as "5 stars," however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why I give it a mere "1 star."  You'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  Talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what I've written here.  Because I adore the scent, I'm going to try the Baby Phat Goddess Body Lotion and see if that has a lingering effect	neg
Excellent! I am thrilled about finally finding coffee that smells and tastes just like what you can get at good hotels and brasseries in Europe. I was previously buying Lavazza's SuperCrema, in whole bean format, because I had tried it at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Beverly Hills and thought it was great. However, it would not turn out the same using my semi-automatic home espresso machine and my low-end grinder. Therefore, for those who do not own $12,000 fully automatic commercial espresso machines like that restuarant did, this coffee is a much better choice. The Caffee Espresso comes in perfectly ground cans ready for the home Espresso machine. The Italians at Lavazza definitely know what they're doing! --- Definitely buy this coffee and enjoy	pos
There are a few things that I liked about my simple round about better.  Such as, the latch system is more difficult in the Decathalon.  Overall though, very impressive car seat safety system.

I can't begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill.  I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge.  The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item, but at about $30-40 a pop, it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski's apartment.

Ain't that the truth? Your best friend will step over your dead body to have these scissors. They are so sharp and perfect for either lefties (like me) or righties (I'm guessing).

They cut through anything: paper, hair, high-quality denim, several layers of tape, I've even cut through a staple with them	pos
Great sound, low listening fatigue. This does not over-accentuate low frequncies, so if you're looking for overly booming bass, this is not it. Note that it's an "open" design, so that you will hear environmental noise pretty clearly - it will not keep outside noises out	pos
I have a climber!  She could climb out of her crib at age 13 months.  She was way too young for a bed.  We also have the crib tent II and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night--not roaming her room or house while we sleep.  It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe.  Life saver	pos
These cereal bars by Kellogg's are the best!  ---  --- Well, actually, at first I wasn't that sure. It's rare to see a cereal bar on the grocery shelf that actually has 20 % of your daily requirement for fiber in just one bar! I was very impressed by that claim and so I brought a box home to try it out. ---  --- These cereal bars are tasty and quite easy to chew on when you're in need of a quick breakfast or snack that has some health quality to it. They aren't that expensive, either. Moreover, there are no trans fats although there is a very, very slight amount of partially hydrogenated oils in the bar. These cereal bars contain some vitamins, too, which is always a plus.  ---  --- However, one caveat: be careful if you have any allergies to wheat, soy, milk and/or almonds. Stay away unless your doctor tells you it's OK to have this food.  ---  --- Highly recommended! Enjoy!    SMILES	pos
I bought this toy for my shark-crazed 5 year-old... she was so stoked and we prepped the tank, added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish. Less than 24 hours later, they were dead. Repeat... 40 hours later... same story. We tried a single Betta, Frank, but less than 4 days later... he's dead. We don't know what it is. The water was tested, it's fine. We think it is the overall design of the tank, could the tight-fitting lid be responsible? Possibly ammonia by-product buildup from the fish? Who knows. But we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin	neg
Seriously, I don't know how anyone can use this thing.  I have had tatoos, waxing, and dental fillings, and I would rather have any and all of those before I ever try this product again.  It feels like an electric shock and continuous pulling of duct tape on your skin.  Just awful.  In the products defense, I don't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).  I was able to remove the hair from about 2 inches of my leg and I gave into the pain and went back to shaving.  Yikes	neg
I purchased this for my 17 month old son who normally sleeps in a crib. I was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots. So in figuring this would also be good for travel, I bought it. My son loves it! The whole thing is like a mesh beach chair. I put it together in about 8 seconds. The removable fitted sheet that comes with it -is soft. The entire thing is easy to wipe clean. It looks comfy. It says it is good for kids up to 75lbs. and 52 inches.

Somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers: a nice Zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller, a MacLaren umbrella stroller, and in the middle this red Peg Perego Aria stroller. We have had nothing but bad news with this Aria stroller. What a clunker! As an Italian, I am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous. I am only being slightly facetious. This stroller is very sleek and stylish, and light-weight, but that is where it all ends.  ---  --- The biggest flaw is the poor handling/wheels. Pushing and steering is a constant battle. Sometimes it just doesn't want to go. I have really tried to inspect where the problem is, and it does not look like the wheels stick. Rather, the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller. Just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what I mean. Other nits include the Aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off, and the baby's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable.  But the biggest problem is the handling --- it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore.	neg
Very convenient carseat, can be placed in the combi double stroller, which is the only side by side stroller that I have seen that you can attach an infant seat into. (and I've searched a lot) The carseat is comprable to the Peg Perego Primo Viaggo (whichI also have) but you can;t connect that one into the Aria twin, the peg perego side by side. ---  The seat itself is lightweight and easy to manage, and VERY soft with the foam insert. It's easy to get into the car with or without the base. Only complaint would be that the straps could be a little longer because you can't have both a baby bunting bag and the foam insert otherwise the straps aren't long enough to comfortably get the baby in and out.   --- Also, our daughter was extremely colicky from 5 weeks to 12 weeks and would only sleep in this carseat, so it must be pretty comfortable	pos

The day I ordered this pair at Amazon, I saw the same Homedics slippers at Sears for $21.99 on sale and I was immediately assured that price wise, this is a great buy. I got the slippers within 3 days. The material is very soft and "towely", and pretty in pink- it feels really good to just walk in them. Though they have a battery compartment underneath the sole, they are not too heavy to walk in either. Each slipper uses 2 AA batteries. The massage is actually more effective while sitting. And my mum and my sister keep eyeing my slippers. I ordered another one for my future mum-in-law as well! I'm sure she'll love it. Also, I wear a shoe size 8, sometimes 8.5, but the Homedics Small Size for the massaging slippers fit just fine, actually a little better coz a good fit gives a better feeling of the vibrations.

I struggled with the decision to buy this trike, thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth.

Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius, and me and my back thank them. I no longer live in fear of "daddy push me," since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible "pushing a tricycle" stance. The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. I recommend it	pos

When people talk about buddy-buddy films this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast, Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself wanders off in various directions until it comes home with unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long while.	pos
As we near the end of the life span of the last generation of consoles, key franchises that have appeared year after year begin to wrap up their yearly development cycle. Crazy as it may sound, Madden NFL 07 could be one of the last times we see Madden on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, or the GameCube. With that in mind, it's not altogether surprising that Madden 07 doesn't really push the envelope terribly far. The game includes a few new control features and some mode tweaks (nearly all of which are also available in the Xbox 360 version of this year's game), but for the most part, it feels like the result of a series pushed as far as it can possibly go on a given platform, and you definitely get the sense that Madden on current-generation consoles is beginning to wind down. However, for at least this last year, the veteran player outraces the up-and-comer in the Xbox 360 version, and there are certainly enough compelling reasons to check this year's game out on the older consoles.  ---   --- Madden NFL 07 brings back practically every feature that was in Madden 06. On top of that, a number of new gameplay upgrades have been brought to the table, the majority of which are available in all versions of the game. By themselves, none of these individual changes or upgrades is particularly game changing, but taken as a whole, they add a nice dimension of depth.  ---  --- These features include the highlight stick, a new kick meter, and lead blocking controls. The highlight stick is a new version of the truck stick used for runners on offense. Here, you can use the right control stick to pull off the sorts of crazy jukes and steps that star running backs are so well known for, and on top of that, depending on the type of back you're playing, you can opt to use more-powerful moves, or more finesse-based maneuvers. This feels like the natural evolution of last year's truck stick, though most experienced Madden players will be able to get by just as easily using the button-based moves rather than making liberal use of the stick. But if you take the time to learn the stick and figure out how to use it and the button controls together, you can be a very hard runner to stop.  ---  --- The new lead blocking controls are likely to inspire some new tactics from all types of players. Here, while on offense, you can opt to switch your controlled player to any of the available blockers during a running play. This includes offensive linemen, tight ends, fullbacks, or whoever else might be blocking on a play. When blocking, you can just do standard blocks, or you can even get dirty and do some mean-spirited cut blocks. This is an interesting mechanic, because it stops you from having to rely on CPU blockers, which as any experienced player will tell you, are not always the most reliable players on the field. You can also quickly switch back to control the running back once you've laid down your block, which is good, because the CPU running back doesn't always manage to find the holes you're creating. At first, you may find yourself unable to effectively use this feature, as setting up the right blocks isn't always the most intuitive thing in the world. But after some time, this control method gives the running game a really interesting new perspective, and those who love finding new strategies are bound to eat this up.  ---   --- The new kick meter is probably the most accurate representation of kicking available in a game thus far. With this meter, you use the typical arrow to line up your angle and then press down on the right analog stick to set up your power. The meter quickly fills up, and then you press forward on the right stick to set the power as well as your accuracy. The accuracy is based on the angle at which you press up. If you press too far to the right or left, the kick will get away from you. If you land it within a set space, it will go pretty much right where you want it to.  ---  --- Beyond that, the changes from 06 to 07 are mostly ancillary, and fundamentally, the game plays very much as its predecessor did. On defense, there are a few more available options in terms of positioning your defensive players, and you can commit your defense in a certain direction the moment the ball is snapped. On offense, the quarterback vision cone, which made its debut last year, is still available, though it's not a required feature. You can just tap the right analog stick after snapping the ball, and it will pop on, letting you use it for a little accuracy boost. No, it's not any more fun to use than it was last year, but that's not altogether surprising. Otherwise, pretty much every control feature you've come to expect from Madden is front and center once again. Potentially, some people could play through Madden 07 and never really partake in the new running control features, but there's definitely enough in all the available upgrades to add a significant layer of depth to the experience.  ---  --- Even though Madden NFL 07 doesn't have any big, game-changing features to make it an especially memorable iteration of the series, its roster of small, but useful changes are ultimately more compelling than anything Madden 06 had on offer last year. And while some people are undoubtedly over the notion of playing new games on old consoles, Madden 07 shows that it can still deliver some enjoyable football, regardless of what platform it's on. It's not a big step forward, and the similarities between this year and last year might be a tough sell for some. But it's those similar aspects that Madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor, and if you skipped out on 06, then there's no good reason to ignore 07.  --- 	pos
Advil liquigels are excellent for headaches.  I am writing this review to warn customers that this product from Amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks (as advertised).

There was nothing in this book that our association hasn't covered nearly every week.  I was very dissapointed.  It offered little tidbits like "a postgame review can help you learn from experience".  Don't we ALL do "postgame reviews", even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home?

This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 - Spend the money on this case to protect your phone!  I looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly - really PROTECTIVE.  The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going ka-plooky - 'nuf said - I needed a better grade, clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad.  Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear, quality stuff.  Secondly, the super-soft, matte black leather is a sweet fit - nice and snug, form-fitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching.  The cut outs are perfectly lined up too - there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back (not mentioned in the ads).  Snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel.  Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product - but if you're like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life, you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases. Be nice to yourself and your phone - Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff	pos
I bought two boxes of these Luv diapers (thats 448 diapers!) and I sure wish I had spent a little extra for Pampers Swaddlers.  These diapers leak out the top because they don't have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist.  Even the generic Kroger diapers have elastic waistbands!  I am just sad that I have to use these crappy diapers for so long! I also think they run small so I probably will not even use them all. What a waste!  The only good thing about these diapers is the price, but, I would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue.  P.S. I don't like Huggies either because they leak out the legs! Hard to find a good diaper	neg

The subject provided a good historical perspective on Japan's Renaissance period, post civil wars and pre-westernization. In many respects Musashi, a Ronin represents Japan's search for an identity, a country ruled by military might in the form of the Shogun, yet keeping an Emperor who they revered as a god, a god without power. This Sword Saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel; he was also an artist, a lithographer and an author. Yet, he was masterless, masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer's devotion to his master. He was his own master, in a time when Japan had no voice, serving all, without righteous. It would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the Samurai, that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of Miyamoto Musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession, master of the sword	pos
A spearmint top note, a lemon middle, and a clean bottom.

 --- GOLF DIGEST is the big daddy of a well-populated family of golf publications. It's self-styled tag line--'The #1 Golf Publication'--is well-earned. ---  --- Where other weeklies report the golfing *news*, GOLF DIGEST is a monthly celebration of golf as life, or at least of the golfing life. It's golf-star-celebrity-packed articles tend to wear titles in the imperative ('Don't Stretch Your Wedges'), giving the sense that the golf world is populated by feverish self-improvers. ---  --- Even those of us who are less than bent on links glory, the photography of this publication looks extraordinary. This aspect reaches its zenith during the magazine's frequent published admirations of the finer courses around the world. ---  --- No doubt about it, GOLF DIGEST is a lifestyle magazine as much as anything else. Yet the semi- to really-serious golfer will find its pages rich with suggestions on improving his or her game. ---  --- GOLF DIGEST anchors the world of English-language golfing publications.

The overwhelming impression I get from this film is: wow, these guys are alive! They are not just making their way through a boring life, they're out there doing interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures & generally living their lives to the fullest. The "they" that I refer to includes just about everybody in the movie, from Paul Pena to the guys travelling with him to Richard Feynman to the Tuvans that Paul meets and befriends. ---  --- The documentary gets hazy in spots (I'm still not sure of some of the Tuvan inter-relationships) but does a good job of establishing empathy with Pena, a blind man relying on others in a place far from home. The DVD extras are o.k., the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie.

I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's). ---  --- However, the unit failed to control odors after about 9 months.  Since then I've had to hide it in various places of my home to keep the odor to a minimum.  Definitely not convenient. ---  --- The unit has one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control.  Unlike the Diaper Champ which allows you to deposit a diaper without opening the container and letting odors escape, Diaper Dekor has no such provision.  It has two "trap doors" that allow you to drop the diaper in easily, and then they are supposed to spring back into place.  Still, no matter how quickly you drop that diaper in, and let the top lid fall closed, strong odors inevitably escape.  Also, these "trap doors" are quite flimsy.  The hinge on one of them recently broke so that the door no longer springs back into its closed position, thereby contributing to the odor problem.  I inquired about a replacement from Regal Lager and they said I could purchase one for $10.  Instead I decided to purchase a new Diaper Champ, since I've pretty much had it with this thing. ---  --- Speaking of flimsy, there are two other flaws I've experienced.  Firstly, the plastic foot pedal has cracked and seems loose.  It still works, but I have to wonder for how much longer. ---  --- Also, the door on the bottom of the unit that enables you to cut off the bag and remove it does not close very tightly, once again contributing to a lack of odor control.  The door is only held shut by a small plastic latch, leaving a significant gap for odors to escape. ---  --- Overall, I have not been impressed with Diaper Dekor Plus.  However, contrary to what some people say regarding the liner refills, that actually was never one of my bigger complaints.  I did not find them cost-prohibitive at all, because you get 3 liners for $20 and I found that 3 liners will last me about 6 months of holding toddler-size diapers.  In the 1 year 9 months that I've owned this system, I've only had to purchase refills twice.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that I did find it inconvenient to have to purchase liners online (couldn't find any local store that carried them) and wait for them to be shipped to me, especially when there is no indication of when you will reach the end of your last liner. ---  --- Diaper Dekor is the only system I have used extensively, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.  I'm hoping my Diaper Champ will serve me better	neg

Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful authors I have read in recent times.

Amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. Only someone like Al Capone could sympathize with this group on the Oregon. How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are clichï¿½, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band.

I finished almost all final fantasy games. (FF1 - 10, 10-2, FF Tactics).  I would say that this FF XII is the best gameplay in final fantasy I ever dream off since my childhood.  I will summarize as follows. ---  --- 1.  Game play:   ---  --- I would rate this 10 stars but here the max is just 5.  The game looks boring at first, but once you get a party and the A.I. system ( called Gambit in the game ), this is extremely fun.  The battle environment is superb.  Looks much like real battle.  No battle scene.  No random battle.  Everything appears on the map.  Multiple attacks can land on the enemy at the same time.  The camera view is half-global (you can see everything, if there is no obstacle, from front, behing, left, right, and above, not below though since the floor is an obstacle.)  THIS IS LIKE THE REAL THING.  THE THING I WANT TO SEE IN FINAL FANTASY! ---  --- 2.  Graphic:  superb.  The rendered texture looks inferior to FF X and FF X-2, when these two have the highest quality of the cutscene displayed.  But the over all cut scene is better since in FF X and X-2, there are sometimes that the cutscene looks really bad.  I am more satisfied to something that is smoothly good on average, not too good cutscene and then extremely bad at times. ---  --- 3.  Music:  Superb.  Thus far, no normal battle music, but that does not matter.  The music is not so great when you listen separately, but it suits the game environment a lot. ---  --- 4.  Trivia:  the town is so huge.  Look like the real town.  Approximately more than 50-100 people you can talk with in each town.  The costume looks so different.  It is not just like the old series of this game where the town person in town A may looks exactly alike that in another town if you notice.  But in FF XII, you have to notice meticulously to see that similarity.  Overall, everyone looks unique! ---  --- Another thing I would say that the environment looks much like STAR WARS + LORD OF THE RINGS, though I put more emphasis on the former.  If you watch STAR WARS Episode I, you will see why I think it looks much like STAR WARS. ---  --- Cons:  I would say that these cons is nothing compared to the pros. ---  --- 1.  Storyline.  Quite simple.  No plot twist thus fat I have played.  Not many things stimulate the players to want to know what will happen next.  Unlike FFX, that game introduced many interesting plots from the beginning and gradually unraveled them as the game proceeded.  I would say that if you were to watch only the movies and the cutscene, FFXII sounds like a normal  battle story in the middle age. (But why there are so many hi-tech transportation?) ---  --- 2.  Voice.  I would say that the voice actors in this game is quite disappointing.  They did the good job, I admitted, but their voices doesn't seem to sound good.  For example, compared to FF X, the main female protagonist has the unique voice, but that in FF XII sounds like typical american people.  The second main female protagonist in FF X sounds unique, but that in FFXII sounds ok, not so great.  The main antagonist in FF X sounds mysteriously great, but that in FFXII sounds quite dull.  The only one that I think he sounds ok is the main male protagonist.	pos

I would have liked additional coverage of digital SLRs, but I have found that elsewhere, and still prefer Complete Digital Photography's treatment of the broader topics	pos
this watch has it all at a nice price, the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand-hair if u have and i doubt that u don't have, else is a masterpiece, all stainless steel, even base, thermomener and a smart cronograph, plus 3 yrs battery, this is my favourite, no other watch has this price/quality proportion. try it and u will be satisfied, sporty but looks elegant too	pos
The company/shipping was fine.  No beefs there.  The product itself I find to be rather damaging to the skin.  In order to extract, you have to press down EXTREMLY hard, (If you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  I can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  I wouldn't reccomend this product. I just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  :	neg
I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment. ---  --- 1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible. ---  --- 2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system. ---  --- 3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years ---  --- 4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!) ---  --- 5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there? ---  --- During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product. ---  --- Cheers, Joh	neg
How to steal a million was a light-hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right.  Audrey Hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by Peter O'Toole an expert in forged art works.  The two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper.  Once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances.  Greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork.  It is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone's head.  Dishonesty doesn't enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax.  Everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets.  The two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch.  Mind candy doesn't necessarily have to rot your brain.  It can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night	pos

I got into Aquis microfiber towels because my aged mother does not have the arm strength for big fat terry towels.  I then bought some for myself because besides being light they absorb like crazy -- one swipe and you're dry.  I decided to get one of the 'adventure' line because information was that they are like the dog-drying towels which are very like the lisse crepe ones.  What I didn't realize was not only I buying a very nice towel, it comes in a very nice little nylon zippered bag, mesh on one side to facilitate drying.  We're talking the sort of little bag you'd spend about $5 to buy from a travel gear catalog.  I was thrilled to pieces.  Also in keeping with the 'adventure'-travel theme, these towels have little tags on one corner that can be snapped back on themselves to form a loop to hang the towel from.  Very handy for camping, meaningless but not annoying for home use.  I like how the loop normally is just a long tag so that the loop does not tangle in the washer	pos

This monitor worked pretty well for 4 months. We purchased this monitor and it worked well provided we were in the next room or on the same floor as the receiver. However, when we were downstairs (baby's room upstairs next to our's) the monitor was fuzzy, and had static and lines running thru. We were still able to have audio recpetion. After 4 months, the picture disappeared, audio was still operational. Not a good camera for long term	neg
The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst.

After growing up in Africa, one becomes rather fond of Rooibos tea and I never thought the day would arrive when I would recommend anything but a pure Rooibos tea. Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm. ---  --- Rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an African veld fire. I remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child. Now I mix in powdered milk and honey. Honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend. For some reason, this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon/raisin bagel.  ---  --- I've recently rediscovered the health benefits of Rooibos although I can truly say I've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet. Rooibos is naturally sweet, very aromatic and is high in magnesium, calcium, iron and copper. Mothers in Africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic. An application of cold Rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies, indigestion, insomnia and nervous tension.  ---  --- This is one of the Tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors. If you enjoy this tea, you might also want to try Tazo Honeybush tea.  ---  --- The Tazo company really has my attention with their packaging, amusing tales of ancient Tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection.  ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.com	pos

I did my research before purchasing this wireless card from Amazon to use in conjunction with my Belkin Pre-N wireless router.  According to every net review I'd read, this combination of Belkin Pre-N desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class, and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router, 'range' is what I needed above all. ---  --- After some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself, I now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90% range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely (and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not I had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability.) ---  --- The odd thing about this 'Pre-N' combination from Belkin is that apparently the later Belkin N equipment is grossly inferior, and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model.   ---  --- These cards and the Pre-N router are becoming harder to find as they've been superseded by the newer (inferior) models currently in the stores, so if you have to operate wireless at great distances, I doubt you'll beat these Belkin models for at least the immediate future	pos
This is one of the great "unknowns" in the movie world: a great film seen by very few people. I'm still waiting for the DVD but not holding my breath. Thankfully, my VHS is still good. But like anything good, we'd like to share this with others and most people have never heard of this movie. ---  --- For those sensitive souls who enjoy a fascinating portrait of an unusual person or persons that is both sad and uplifting, this is your ticket. It has both, in spades.....a haunting film you can't forget. It's a tragic tale yet has a happy ending of sorts and leaves you feeling satisfied. ---  --- What it is, and I can't remember if it is based on real-life situation, is the story of a woman who has a dwarf for a son and what happens to the two of them, beginning in France, moving to Ireland, over to the United States and then back to Ireland. ---  --- Along the way, the mother, played so sadly by French actress Anne Parillaud (the original La Femme Nikita), gets involved with two men: Gabriel Byrne and Matt Dillon. All three of these adults are really interesting, likable people, but nothing like the dwarf, who is played magnificently by two actors. Alan Pentony plays "Frankie" has a child and a more lovable kid would be hard to find. Corbin Walker does a great job of playing the adult "Frankie." Trust me: you will not forget either of them. ---  --- Walker narrates the film, telling it mostly in flashback style, from his best-selling book. In addition to his mom and the two father-figures in his life, is a short story of Frankie's love affair with astronomy and the stars, hence "Frankie Starlight." ---  --- The only profane character in the movie is the book publisher who has two short scenes. That, and two quick sex scenes, give it the "R" rating. Otherwise, this is wonderful old-fashioned storytelling, the kind that makes you really care about the characters.	pos

I got Tiger to improve the working of my Powerbook G4 1.5.  My Jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with Tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer.  Before Tiger, my computer would hang when playing large DV files (such as the ones I made in iMovie) but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same.  This Tiger upgrade doesn't include some of the apps (games, Quicken, etc.) that my wife has on her new MacBook, but it did include a 30-day trial verion of iWorks which has come in handy	pos
Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like  surgical gloves he did at hospitals. ---  --- No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little. ---  --- Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in. ---  --- Well, movie spirit seems being similar to "A Beautiful Life", "Producers" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only. 	pos
We have a "closet shower", which made it difficult to get out of the way of the water spray (not to mention having water spray out the door).  We picked up this neat little shower head, and we're much happier now.  You can avoid the water more easily (for shaving, washing body, etc.), and since it aims straight down, no more turning the shower head all the way to the side to avoid it going right out the door.  It's inexpensive, and has made our shower experience much better.  I definitely recommend it	pos

Believe it or not, i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade. i guess the whole battery problem depends on the usage and the person. My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing!  --- I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it. I do it to my laptop and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack, the Tungsten 2E. Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks. Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit word, excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook. Which i absolutley can not put up with. Even the contacts wouldn't backup! Needless to say, the Treo 680 saved me. If you do go the way of the blackjack without Outlook, look into SBSH's programs Facade and Papyrus. However, if you go with the lovely Treo check out "DialByPhoto" i think the coolest part is how you can set up a "Favorite 5" like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular	pos
Can't really add much to the reviews. This is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older. I'll admit that when this came out in '94, I only bumped the singles. It didn't grab me at the time. Sometime around '97 I gave it a spin and I've been loving it ever since. There are plenty of bangers on the album, but classics like "Pour Out A Little Liquor", "Str8 Ballin' ", "How Long Will They Mourn Me", Cradle To The Grave", and "Under Pressure" make this album worth owning all by themselves. The rest of the songs are on point too -- there isn't much filler on this album. The production is handled by Warren G. & Nate Dogg (1), the awesone yet underrated Easy Mo B (1), Johnny J (1), Jay & Mopreme (1), Jay & Syke (1), Stretch (1), and Thug Music (4). I'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks. ---  --- The only tracks that I would call skip material are "Sh** Don't Stop" and "Don't Get It Twisted". "Sh** Don't Stop" is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive. The production is on "Don't Get It Twisted" cool, but it's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it (in my opinion). ---  --- Volume 1 is a passionate, if at times misdirected, release from the Thug Life camp. The production is nothing short of vintage mid 90's Cali vibes. It holds up very well 13 years after its release. Of course, if you're a Tupac completist, you probably have this album already. But even if you're not a Pac fan, this should be a part of your collection. ---  --- R.I.P. Tupac ---  --- Standout Tracks: How Long Will They Mourn Me feat. Nate Dogg, Pour Out A Little Liquor, Str8 Ballin' (My Favorite), Cradle To The Grave, Under Pressure, Bury Me A G feat. Natasha Walker (of Y.N.V.)	pos
I bought this curling iron impulsively, as I perused through the "gold box" items some time ago.  When I first received the it, I was amazed at how well it worked; it heated up quickly, and did a wonderful job on my hair.  After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached.  I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE.  It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a "low" setting of 5.  When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.  The next day, coworkers were commenting on my lovely new SHORT haircut.  If you're really interested in purchasing this item, please learn from my mistake, and if the tip melts off, take that as a sign that it will also melt your hair	neg
I ordered this product for my 3 year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems! The two major problems with this product is that 1.) it's quite bulky, and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway, and 2.) check if it will fit in your carseat. I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though. It's quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though	neg
The movie starts out with our hero, Izo, being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team, and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar. While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion. ---  --- This movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it	pos
This movie is great!  Very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud.  Love it	pos

There are no professionals or would-be professional  photographers in our house.  Instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family.  We're not particularly interested in birds, flowers, bugs, race cars, etc.  We want to catch our kids doing what they love best; football, basketball, swimming, band, golf... ---  --- My only advantage is that I am very experienced with Adobe Photoshop, which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots. ---  --- This year our son is a high-school senior.  Instead of buying an expensive portrait package, we voted to spend the money on a Canon Digital Rebel XT kit (with lens).  We choose one extra zoom lense (the 75-300mm f4-5.6 III USM Telephoto) for up-close action sports shots.  We didn't chose the IS lens because it was out of our price range. ---  --- We are having great fun with this camera and lens.  We have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera (burst mode at full zoom).  They are great - crisp and clear.  These have been taken in full sun.  We realize that we'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations.  But I think we can do it. ---  --- I would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots.  They might not be professional quality, but they are just what we wanted	pos

I bought this camera in the beginning of January. I was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size, though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. Based on test reports at DPreview and other customer reports I decided for the Fuji F31fd. I was intrigued by the new sensor that Fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive, which is true. After receiving the camera I took a lot of test pictures under various conditions, with and without flash, bright light, low light, different ISO settings, different exposure times, etc. I compared the pictures with my 4-year old SONY DSC-V1 and the results were amazing. The picture quality of the Fuji was very poor. Colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. Even under bright light conditions and ISO 100 settings the white had considerable noise, same with other colors (RGB noise). I didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. What a disappointment. The lens seemed to be pretty poor as well, at least there was no comparison to the SONY DSC-V1 with a Carl Zeiss lens. After one week we returned the camera and I bought the SONY H5. This is really a great camera, I must admit. The picture quality is even better than with the V1 and I thought that the V1 was already pretty good. I can only recommend SONY's H5, even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller F31fd. What I liked about the F31fd was its size, its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. However, if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help	neg

I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....   ---  --- 2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player	neg
I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.	pos
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS	neg

Need I say more than the above title suggests? Okay, so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. There are some touching moments in this book, but even then there is still something the author is lacking. I saw the movie when it was in theatres and I have just finished reading the book. I liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book. The movie was funny, entertaining, touching, personal, and sad at times. The book did not captivate me at all. I had trouble staying focused. Considering Beverly Donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree in English from Wesleyan University and a master of fine arts in creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. Her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education, if even that. And not to go off topic, but since Donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like Columbia U, then why doesn't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life? I mean, after all, the MFA is in creative writing, meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time. She has only wrote 2 books--Riding in Cars With Boys, and Looking For Mary, both about her getting pregnant at a young age. If you liked the movie, just leave it at that. Don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed. And if you're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy, then go to the local library. Don't get this one. There's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one. 	neg
...heart-wrenching break-up with his girlfriend of 8 years, Elastica's Justine Frishmann.  13 is a dark record, produced by William Orbit.

I recieved this as a gift for Christmas day as a surprise.  However, there was a mishap at Wal Mart I guess and the mic they told my parents would work actually didn't so I hadn't been able to play until yesterday.  However, now that it's all sorted out I was finally able to play using the USB PS2 head set.  And the game is actually so much fun.  First time I tried I went to familiar songs, so I selected "Pieces of Me".  I did so bad for the first time it was laughable, it failed me just as I started the second verse.  But the game gets so much better after your first few tries. ---  --- After a while I was easily getting Gold on expert judging (I immidiately like the challenge myself).  I was breezing through songs I grew up loving such as Irene Cara's "Fame", Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music", and Vicki Sue Robinson's "Turn The Beat Around".  Then I was going through songs that were dominating my CD player not too long ago such as Ashlee Simpson's "Pieces of Me", Incubus' "Drive", Beyonce's "Crazy in Love", and Hilary Duff's "Fly".  And it's even better with classics such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Blondie's "Call Me", The Commodores "Brick House", and Whitney Houston "I Will Always Love You" (one of the many I haven't quite nailed yet).  Now in order to make platinum from Beyonce do you have to actually sing like her?  No, which makes the game very accessable.  However, it doesn't hurt to be familiar with your singing voice. ---  --- Over all this is a very fun game with only one problem.  While the songs may be fun, it's very VERY diverse.  Sometimes too diverse for it's own good.  Take for example that when me and my Mom want to play, the songs we personally know are from two different erras.  I'm wanting to bust out with "Call Me", and she's wanting to do "I Left My Heart In San Francisco".  This can creates the only problem: that unless your an all around music-know-it-all (which I'm not quite there yet) you'll end up doing the same songs over and over again. ---  --- But this really doesn't bring the game down.  If you've been around and listened to a wide variety of songs then you should be able to cover a good 30 songs.  And not to mention, it would make a great party game.  I would suggest getting this game if you're into having fun while not being afraid to make a fool of yourself	pos

This book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life. It combines something of the science, the personalities and the history of this field. For general readers with some technical sophistication it  affords an opportunity to broaden one's horizons without too much of a  mathematical stretch; for computer scientists who are thinking of their own  research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the  field and a place to start delving into the original research papers.

Conceptually this is a great game, especially for a child with visions of being a Vet. You (can theoretically) learn about animals, their care and health issues. Those 2 stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else. ---  --- Unfortunately the general usability of this game, vis-à-vis lousy controls, is quite low. It's nearly impossible to move the character at times, which results in stressful failure in the game. It crashes. It can't remember simple settings like, leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off.  ---  --- Playing this multiple times with my 6 year old always goes from excitement to frustration (bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman).   ---  --- Once going you can engage your child by "studying" the books you've bought. Also, as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments. That is all good stuff, but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy.  ---  --- One final note, this is the first time I've ever bothered to review any product.	neg
I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair. Our local retail stores,mark them up, so ridiculously. Thank you, Amazon	pos
I purchased your "Space Saver Highchair" for my 9 month old daughter who is severely disabled. Finding equipment for the very young disabled child is very difficult.  This chair works for everything!  This chair is so comforatable for my daughter and allows her to sit up and play with her toys as she gets very bored laying on her back all day.  She also has a very difficult time playing with her toys as her grasp is not well controlled and she is constantly dropping toys on her face or off to the side and cannot get them back in her hand. I love this chair for its size, the way the whole seat tilts (not just the back), and the 5 point harness.  The chair is also small so it holds her very nicely.  My daughter loves nothing more than to sit in this chair all the time	pos
This is an essential collection for every Al Pacino fan. In Carlitos Way and Scarface he does one of his best work ever. Then there is the performance that gave him his only Oscar so far in A Scent of a Woman. If  you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the  Al Pacino collection	pos
Got this drive a few weeks ago for an Apple Power Mac G4 Cube. --- The G4 Cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious. ---    --- Thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed.   --- This drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is.  Unbelievable.   ---  --- Don't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep. --- Disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6-8 inches from the Cube and is totally non-existent more than 12 inches from the Cube. ---  --- Will not hesitate to buy Seagate Barracuda drives for all future machines. --- The 5-year warranty is a winner. ---  --- Highly recommend this drive for its silence, speed, cost and warranty	pos
collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers! Its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans. i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again	neg
I purchased this item two weeks ago.  My thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced, perfect addition to the "tools" necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby (its advertised contents, construction, and "glow-in-the-dark" planisphere).  After closely examining the item for the past ten days, I'm forced to conclude that I was in error, and that you really do get what you pay for.  As Celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy, I must confess that I assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name.  I have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps.  The major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings, letter transpositions, apparent omitted words, and just plain (what we used to call in the old days) "typographical errors."  Additionally, when I compare some of the technical information on the maps (i.e., star magnitudes, astronomical distances, etc.)and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources I have in my possession, I also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances.  When using a product like this, it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains.  Since I'm not able to do this, I must rate this item with one star.  When I purchased the item, it was marked down by twenty percent.  I note that in less that two weeks since my purchase, the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent.  In this case, don't be fooled (as I was) by an attractive price.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT. (I don't have a substitute to recommend at this time.)     	neg

I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of "the problem". Nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  Even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  Certainly the Baby Boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the US and will create some challenges.   However, the author fails to mention the "echo boom" (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  Both of these facts will "soften" the impact of the  "Gray Doom" that Mr. Peterson tries to create.  I just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  But  I did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. Another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations	neg
The powder/foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large-pored. --- It is one of the best around for no-caking, no-oil, smooth surface skin. --- If you can't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations, Chanel does it best!! --- Also, my seller was terrific	pos
I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. (Note: there is a $5 return charge.)	neg
Paul Johnson has written a 1,000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830, years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today.  Johnson's chosen foci are certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to music, science, and even opium use.  While almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function, Johnson's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning.  Also, while the book claims to be about "world society," Johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about British society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the "western" United States (like Kentucky) to China and Singapore.  Throughout, his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read.   ---  --- Overall, Johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading: a vast book that one can pick up, open nearly at random, and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today	pos
I bought this as a present for my wife.  I was looking for something that she could carry in her purse.  the automatic functions are easy and functional.  It is not an enthusiasts camera:  too hard to get into the menus.  The screen is easy to turn off(this sucks battery power).  and it even has an optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately)  the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are excellent.  The drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg.

if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...	pos
This DVD will bring tears to your eyes.  My father was a professional violist for over 40 years and got much pleasure from this video.  My mother enjoys watching this video at least once a week.

Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back	neg
To describe these as "light and cheap" is exactly right.  And neither is a compliment.  My Thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular (3 or 4 times a week) use.  The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges.  After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor, I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free. ---  --- These handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for.  Save your money	neg

Valkyrie Profile was an RPG that came out during the later days of the PSX.  While it never achieved massive success, it went on to become an RPG classic and has garnered a very loyal following. ---  --- Fast forward to 2006, and we see the re-release of this awesome RPG for the PSP.  However, don't make the mistake of writing this off as a plain old port.   ---  --- Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth includes "new" high quality CG movies that help immerse you in the story.  The graphics consist of highly detailed sprites on pre-rendered backgrounds; when seen on the vivid PSP screen, it just makes the game look downright beautiful.  Some of the combos are just awesome to look at.  ---  --- The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based fighting that is surprisingly intuitive; newcomers and old pro's will have no problem getting used to it.  At first glance, it might look simple, but as you progress through the game, you'll find a depth to it that makes it quite fun. ---  --- The main story, itself, is very well developed...even if this RPG doesn't follow the traditional linear way of telling it.  One of the things I enjoyed most about this game is the character "episodes" you see when you collect a new soul to help in the battle to save Valhalla.   ---  --- If you enjoy RPGs, or feel adventurous enough...I highly recommend you buy this game.  It's definitely a must have PSP game. 	pos
This game is so much fun. We've played it many times without repeating the questions. ---  --- Building your own band is really cool.

What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.

IRONWEED by William J. Kennedy was the latest selection for a book club I've recently joined.  The premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel.  As I expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the screenplay being written by Kennedy himself.  Jack Nicholson plays the main character (Francis) and Meryl Streep is his "wanna be" socialite girlfriend (Helen), but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what Kennedy had already done in the novel. ---  --- Set during the "Great Depression," IRONWEED is a great look at the underbelly of society: drunks, homeless, impoverished, and in that regard the story is timeless.  I enjoyed the characters' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots, but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption, forgiveness, and love.  The love aspect may be hard to spot, but it is there, unconventionally, in many of the character's interactions. ---  --- This favorable recommendation comes with a warning: it can be a depressing read, definitely not a happy one, and while I found it inspirational, it will not conjure any blithe emotions.  IRONWEED is definitely not a June beach read, being more apropos to a long winter night, indoor, by a warm fire.	pos
...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started.

The reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight, but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna-be's of true cultural wits like Mencken and Updike.

I'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag, and save your money to buy books that nourish you.	neg
I subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to Woodworkers Journal since 1990.  Each magazine has a character of it's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents.  This magazine is a bit more complex than, say Wood magazine.  It should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified.  I have one of Woodworking Journal's projects in my living room.  It is perhaps the most beautiful piece I have ever made.  If you have become an advanced amature (sp?) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others	pos
If you have read Harmon's acting resume online, then you know she has talent, she has the training, and the ability to really play a good dramatic role if one came along.  But being a mild conservative (Angie is a Republican) in Liberal Hollywood can useually mean that the film companies give her really medicore scripts to look at.  Good Advice was Bad advice for her.  It is miscast with two annoying stars; Sheen and Richards...and some of the worst scenes and dialoge ever in a movie.  It has no redeaming values at all and Angie deserves better roles then this.  This movie was made by Artiscan Films, which recently went into bankruptcy and is now Lions Gate Films, their films are still bad no matter the name change, and I still wait to see a better movie come to Angie Harmon	neg
***** --- This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, stevia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely. ---  --- I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. ---  --- There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. ---  --- Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend. --- ****	pos
What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it	neg

First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself.  I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it: ---  --- (1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung.

I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time. ---  --- (2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well.  Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close.  On the 3rd attempt it actually did work. ---  --- (3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk". ---  --- I consider it item a waste of money	neg

I was a bit skeptical about buying this product because of the other products I have tried that claimed to be spot-free and failed   miserably.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Mr. Clean AutoDry system!  If you follow the directions and put a bit of effort into your wash job it works very, very good! ---  --- - You first rinse off your vehicle with regular, unfiltered water either through the AutoDry gun or with your regular hose sprayer. ---  --- - Next, you use the AutoDry on the "soap" setting and completely cover the vehicle.  They advise to only use the Mr. Clean soap, of course, because it contains agents not normally found in other car washing soap that assists in the sheeting action (similar to Jet Dry for the dishwasher) ---  --- - Thirdly, you give the vehicle an old fashioned hand wash with a sponge.  Make sure you do a good job and clean it completely or you will find streaks when it dries with the old dirty water smeared all over. ---  --- - Fourth, rinse the vehicle completely with unfiltered water.  Make sure you are very through in this stage.  Take your time! ---  --- - Finally, set the AutoDry to the filtered rinse setting and go over the vehicle again.  Make sure you start at the vehicle's highest point to remove all the tap water sitting on the roof.  Basically, you want the filtered water to remove all the unfiltered water.  Spray the filtered water in all the crevices to avoid spots later (side view mirrors, bumpers, etc.) ---  --- Although it sounds like it takes a long time it is really quite quick if you put some effort into it.  I can do a complete vehicle (Ford Explorer) start to finish in about 15 minutes.  The car dries completely spot free EVERY time!  Of course, the results will only be as good as YOU make them.  If you don't wash completely or rinse the unfiltered water off completely there WILL be spots.  It is up to you to do a through job to get great results	pos
If you are looking for this to be very accurate, then you need to use the lithium batteries.  Because of the cold temps here, the cheaper batteries do not work as well.  Maybe where it doesn't get in the minus temps, the Rayovac batteries will be okay, but not here in NE.  The sensor needs to be put in a location, that is out of the sun, and out of reach of your pets, and children.  Which makes for a little decision making time, on your part. 	pos
I have used these to change the oil on my 2006 Chevy Silverado 4x4.  They work like a champ.  There is plenty of room underneath.  They seem very sturdy.  My only complaint is - my truck kept moving the ramps.  I had to put it in 4 wheel drive to get up them.  This should not be an issue with a front wheel drive.  I also have a 2001 Nissan Maxima.  The ramps fit under the air dam nicely on the Nissan.  I will use these for that vehicle also.  One last note:  The name implies these ramps can hold 12,000 lbs.  This is not the case.  They are actually rated at 3,000 lbs each.  This is plenty of capacity for my full size truck, and for any car I know of	pos

This is one of the bibles for anyone in graphic design, advertising, illustration or photograhy. It digs deep into industry trends, features portfolios of upcoming industry stars, and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously.

I purchased these earrings for my infant daughter. Since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old's ears, this was the perfect solution. As my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap, the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me. These are small enough not to bother me. --- The prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures, but they are still very cute. I also like the backs, as they screw on to the posts, and are nice and safe for baby's head	pos

When my virus protection was about to expire, I was in a quandary.  I wasn't at all happy with the Norton I had purchased last year.  And, I wasn't especially pleased with the McAfee I had used the year before that.  When I checked the local stores, there didn't seem to be anything else to choose from.  I checked Amazon and found more options, plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide.  My son told me that BitDefender had been given the highest rating by Consumer Reports.  That, together with other customer comments on Amazon, helped me decide to give it a try.  So far, I'm delighted with its performance.  In fact, when I first installed it, it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that Norton never caught.  It doesn't appear to be interferring with my system operations (unlike Norton and McAfee), it and doesn't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings.  The best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys	pos
I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none.  In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of "wool-blend".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.  All in all, I regret spending the money on these	neg

Why mess with the original.  There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount.  You get what you pay for.

I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal	pos

After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their "font patch", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H&R Block has lost this customer.	neg
The product works fine. It seems kind of strange that I had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that I needed.

Compared to FP 2000 and earlier versions, it offered some major improvements, even letting one code in (gasp) PHP with live preview - it is highly configurable, and easily tied into SharePoint (well, I think that was the intent).   ---  --- It was quite an evolution, moving beyond FP2000, with some fairly advanced features - while still retaining the "entry level, small business learnable" functionality (albeit cookie cutter designs) of previous versions.   ---  --- I was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with FrontPage (an odd change, knowing MS), but also offered other code functions, some on par with Dreamweaver - but do not mistake this for Dreamweaver, even the first MX version.  It's still aimed at Microsoft only - you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else (e.g, php, cold fusion) - but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions.  Mostly good, some horribly bad. ---  --- The good - being able to tweak it to dozens of standards' compliance, Sec. 508, XML'ish stuff, whatever.  By default these things are not set up, so it does take some learning.   ---  --- What annoyed (and freaked me out) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with Access, to create database driven sites - the database had to remain in a public folder - ok, I suppose if you're using it only on an intranet.   ---  --- I believe the point was to code with Access, then mod it slightly to interact with SQL server - but most folks probaby did not use it that way - knowing the history and "fire and forget" ease of use of FrontPage...  ---  --- Anyhow, I'd call this a para-professional version. It has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of Frontpage, ever.  It is also going bye-bye.   ---  --- There will not be a FrontPage 2007, due to the switch to Expression Web (which retains some FP functionality, but the "friendly" and pesky "bots" are gone).  No more email bots, whatever bots - gotta learn how to roll your own.	pos
One whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass, surrounded by patchouli candles. This is the best way I can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide-open skies. I am not sure where I go when I inhale deeply, but I am no longer in the shower. Follow this with the Skin Sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth. Also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli, orange slices optional, but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 	pos

TaxCut is easy to use but the explanations are not complete, nor written in a way that is easy for laypersons to understand.  Many terms of art are not defined at all.   ---  --- Most disturbingly, when you first sign up for the product the price is listed at $54.95 for both state and federal filing,  but after you have already done all the work and are ready to file, the only options listed at checkout time are $29.95 for federal and another $29.95 charge for the state filing.   ---  --- This bait-and-switch is apparently widespread and common for H&R Block, unfortunately.  I called and complained to customer service and they refunded me $5.  I told them that I thought it was certainly unethical and probably illegal, and they were inviting a lawsuit with this deceptive practice.   ---  --- Finally, the program crashed several times while I was using it.   Although the data was always saved, it was quite obnoxious.  I run a high-performance, well-maintained Mac PowerBook, so I'm not accustomed to having things run so poorly.   ---  --- next year I'll go with TurboTax.	neg

My son loves to read, and he adores this book.

It will bring a smile to your child's face	pos
The learning curve on this watch if you use it for fishing may take some time.  The moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too, but I didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option I used more than any other on previous cheaper watches, a timer.  This one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes.  It keeps great time so far, but that's typical of Casio.  The backlight is very bright, enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight, and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool.  If you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue, this is the one.  And yeah I'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool	pos
The sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good.  I bought this primarily to see Jaco.  The biggest distraction was the bits of James Dean and Doo Wap music videos from the 50's added in.  I wish this was remastered with just the concert performances.  Also, it appears to me that the Jaco Bass solo was cut.  I still give it 5 stars regardless. 	pos
This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year. ---  --- Too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused.  Sound like a couple of 5 year olds. ---  --- The only down side for me I received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed 15 days.  2 days later the software arrivied, right on the day amazon originally said it should.  Don't know why they sent the 15 day delay email	pos
I bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before I tried to set it up. I will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating...we'll apparently they were not.  I tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together...so at that point I gave up and waited for my husbands help. The two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had(after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible)and once we had the center base up I pushed it and it fell completely apart.  We got it back together but there was no way I felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it.  So in desperation I called the ToysRUs store where I got it and spoke w/ the store manager. She assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that I should bring it back.  I wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place...but what choice did I have. I asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c I wasn't about to go through this again.  When I arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy...exactly what I had wanted it to be when I had purchased it. Unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett...just like some of the other reviewers had said.  So the morale of the story is...if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back...but once its together properly its great....now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world!	pos
one of the worst Van Damme movies of all time, this one and Derailed and Replicant and Knock Off, come of Van Damme baby, make good ones and have good directors too. this one has Van Damme after Mickey Rourke who Rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him, then Van Damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians(corny). he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child(who Van Damme and Rodman almost indanger the poor kid, bastards).

This film was probably made not to entertain the audience, but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on Bosnia. But it does so for a small part only, showing the Bosniaks and Serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion. With the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists. Its attempt to blind the viewer, hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper, is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality, but also through poor cinematografic form. The dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie. Handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss. The handling shows several onlogical moments. And as a concept of "we all suffered and we Serbs did not start the war" it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing. This movie does not entertain at all, and shows the events as unrealistic as any B - movie about Vietnamwar. And about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in Serbia. My rating is absolutely thumb down. Comparing with, for example, No Man's Land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former Yugoslavia. Instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war, You can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie	neg

After looking around at the local stores (Fry's and CompUSA) I had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my iPod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise, and had resigned myself to having a "skin" type case for just everyday use and then shifting the iPod to an arm band for exercise. Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses. ---  --- Then I ran into the DLO Action Jacket at Best Buy, which seemed to cover all my intended uses. Unlike the prior reviewer, I found my 40g iPod fits VERY snugly - absolutely zero slop, and I really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case. Also, at $29.95, it's cheaper than the two-case approach. The only criticism I have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case. The process is a little tedious, but the end result is great. The unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there. ---  --- This jacket is a winner	pos

I purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons I made at the doctor's office. I next purchased an Omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable.

I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!   	neg

I'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power. It's compact, not heavy, has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right.

I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play	neg
This mag is for people who think they are computer experts because they can change out a video card or follow directions on changing an OS setting. ---  --- Shallow coverage, and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across. ---  --- It is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet.

The Clean kick-started the illustrious New Zealand label Flying Nun in 1981, providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from Australia (the Chills) to California (Pavement). Over this two-disc, 46-track set of rarities and essentials, the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the Velvet Underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited, rudimentary playing, shaky, Kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies. Disc one, as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs, ends with the Clean's 1983 breakup. Disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996's Unknown Country, mining similar material with even more exciting (and even better-sounding) results. But by then, lots of bands were doing what the mighty Clean had helped pioneer.	pos

Back in the 70's and 80's, I listened to a really great radio station, WSGS in Hazard, Kentucky. From my home in Flat Gap, Virginia, and anywhere in the region, it was well known that if you wanted real country music, you simply had to turn on WSGS. 100,000 watts of pure, monophonic country music. I'm not talking about the big hats of Nashville, or the gussied up ladies who pose as country singers these days. No, it was the real thing, including local and regional bluegrass, gospel, hiccup preachers, Loretta Lynn, Lefty Frizzel, Merle Haggard, Bill Monroe, Grandpa Jones, and countless others. ---     When I listen to this Pattly Loveless release, I think she must have been listening too. It sounds just like the typical afternoon group of selections on old WSGS. Only better, because Patty is from our time, and seems to have that old time, mountain shout-it-out style much like many of those who came before. She reminds me a bit of Wilma Lee Cooper. What a voice! ---     If you have never heard of these early country artists, and you like the way Patty does it up here, it would be good to go back and see where she learned all this great music from.

I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible. ---  --- My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end. ---  --- On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films. ---  --- Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie	neg
The "fake-news" TV movie had already be done, and done better, ten years ealier as "Special Bulletin".  Where the first movie took its subject, nuclear disarmament and terrorism, seriously, this cheese-fest doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence at all.  They pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera.  Not of it ties together in any coherent way and the "make love not war" ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry	neg

I'm 7 months pregnant and have been looking for videos that I can do in short blocks of time, and this one is perfect.  I've been a fan of Tamilee's for quite a while and have several of her tapes, all of which are great.  She's very motivating and encouraging, and I like the fact that she really has a good background (education-wise) when it comes to fitness. This one is no exception.  Just a warning - if you are looking for complete body toning or cadrio, you won't find it here: this one just hits the main areas (legs, biceps, triceps, shoulders, butt and abs).  But that doesn't mean it's easy!  I found myself sweating just doing a few of the exercises (even before I became pregnant) and I'm in fairly good shape.  I'd recommend doing this video and interspersing it with other longer, total body sculpting videos	pos

My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else	neg
 --- I find most "stoner" movies to be too juvenile to bother with. This is not a typical stoner movie, though, because the leads are not slacker losers, they're intelligent guys (one's an investment banker, the other an aspiring med student) who happen to like to hang out together and smoke dope. Which, truth be told, is pretty accurate of a lot of twenty somethings today.  ---  --- The best bits are hilarious. Watch out for the British twin sisters, the evangelical tow truck driver, and Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) as a sex crazed drug addled party animal. The only scene that fell flat for me was the one with the cheetah. Pointless and not funny. That said, this is not highbrow humor. But if this were just a series of frat boy jokes it would have fallen as flat as most other movies of the genre. What really elevates this movie is the Harold and Kumar characters. Silly antics aside, these guys are really likeable and have great on screen buddy chemistry.  ---  --- I don't know why I haven't seen John Cho and Kal Penn in more movies, but the ending makes me hopeful that there will be a sequel	pos
I was very pleased when this toy finally arrived.  The Blue Devil is removable and semi-posable (his arms move).  He is the same size as the Simpson figures from the Playmates line of toys, so I feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind.  The Homer donut-eating action doesn't always work correctly--the mouth and donuts aren't correctly synchronized, so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth--but that does not detract from the fun	pos
My grandparents bought me this for Christmas and I really love it! The doll is absolutely breathtaking, and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights.

There is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories, I love this toy	pos

I spent several months and 5 purchases trying to find a good set of tongs for my husband who is the pickiest "BBQ Expert"...These were one of the WORST. DO NOT BUY THEM. The locking mechanism is clunky. They do not open and close smoothly. The OXO 16 inch Tongs are much better and lighter. You do want tongs that have a hinge vs the ones that are permanently open waiting for you to squeeze them around what you are trying to pick up. Good luck. I had to send these back	neg
Just a comment about the Eagle Talon comment.  In order to use a product successfully one must understand the basics.  I have used this product through a friend and think it is worthy.  I was a Jeep/Eagle technician for many years. Even though it says Eagle on your vehicle it is actually a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  That is why the connector doesn't work.  At the dealership we had a whole separate set of diagnostic tools just to service these types of cars (there were others).  Also OBD1 & 2 is not necessarily meant to tap into other computer systems on your car like ABS, etc if they are not linked.  We also had different connectors and equipment for different systems	pos

The USB 2 is much faster than the original USB ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price	pos

While you could do a lot worse with other snacks, much of the health benefit of eating "fruit" in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives.  High Fructose Corn Syrup and Dextrose are in many, many grocery products, but they are not "Natural" as this manufacturer claims.  Both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body.  HFC as it is called, has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes.   ---  --- I have not tried this product, so I can't comment on the taste.  I would like to try a dried fruit product, one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives. 	neg

First issue arrived today. After tearing up  8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult to read the magazine, I sat back to enjoy. First article  was a lecture by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the danger of mercury in fresh water domestic fish. Perfectly safe to fish we are informed (well duh). Just don't eat what you catch. Expectant mothers should be extra careful as babies with high level of mercury have lower IQs. The net is full of peer-reviewed studies from major universities on the subject of mercury poisoning. Why buy a food magazine to read what an activist lawyer has to say about the subject? ---  --- Next article was in: "Politics and the Plate". The controversy  here concerns local and season foods. Gourmet asks: "Are those who promote them sincere? Or is it just a come on for gullible diners?"  So who does Gourmet think is "gullible"? The reader? Implication seems to be the reader is too stupid to figure out that yes, vendors might promote locally grown products that aren't all that terrific. Nothing of substance in this article at all.  ---  --- Going back to the front, an editor of Gourmet recalls how her late father didn't appreciate health food stores (Aren't fathers stupid?). ---  --- Three downer articles in a row. I gave up. This isn't the magazine I remember from 20 years ago. Even the format is annoying. It is difficult to know where ads end and articles begin (recall the most junked up website you've seen, that is the Gourmet model) ---  ---  If you do enjoy the politics and  the environmental stuff (on either side)  you can do better on the net for free. If you want entertaining, informative articles on food, Gourmet is not the place to look. ---  --- Subscribed to Saveur at the same time as Gourmet. It is a pleasure to read.  No annoying ads, no political screeds. Great photographs. Interesting and exotic recipes. As good or better than Gourmet was decades ago. ---  ---  --- 	neg
Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable.  --- I'm really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680. But happily, there is a quick fix, buy 1-2 more batteries and keep them charged and don't leave home without them ;-	neg
I will be honest I like Dolph Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie classics such as "The Punisher",Universal Soldier" and "Blackjack" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The scene where Jon Penner steals the  air craft while posing as Dolph Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron Eagle  and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says "Once exposed you cannot survive"  Take this as a warning	neg
I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE. 	neg

This mascara goes on beautifully and looks great, but it's messy. It's more liquid than most mascaras and, when I travel with it, the tube leaks!

The new  look is very nice. ---  --- BUT, when you install, you have also to keep the previous version (in well behaved software, automatically the previous version is cleaned... not here). ---  --- The system of validation of License through Internet for the physical machine is fine, I just hope that I will not have a disk crash and then waste time to be authorised to re-install a product that I rightfully paid (and at such a price). ---  --- Well, make sure you: --- - do not try to de-install 5,5 after the install of CS2 (or bye-bye the license) --- - have a clean and robust backup of your installation.... ---  --- I am not sure I will make the next upgrade....	neg

I ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone, and when I received it, I loved the look and feel of it so much that I quickly ordered another just for myself.  It's a very sleek looking watch, very lightweight on your wrist, and the price on Amazon here is at lear 40% below what I have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls.  I intend to use this watch for special occasions as I believe it will complement dressier attire. 	pos

I might have enjoyed this movie more if they hadn't gutted the book, which was a pretty good read. The best character in the book, FBI Special Agent Pendergast, isn't even in the movie, and New York City police Lt. D'Agosta is just a comic caricature of the book's character. ---  --- Another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything. If the purpose was to create a moody, scary atmosphere, they went way too far. ---  --- See if you must, but don't expect too much	neg

Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find.  --- I find it unbelievable that any company producing this item would not include 4 feet of cheap cord so the product could be put in service at once	neg

This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship. 	neg
I'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product.  ---  --- Performance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk. ---  --- I doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.   ---  --- Better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product	neg

This may not be the best tuner on the market- my Boss TU-12H is more sensitive and accurate- and it's not as rugged and convenient as my Boss stage tuner.

Amazing. One or probably the most impressive paintor's book I have. Not easy subjects sometimes, but anyway, always beautiful	pos
This book is a celebration of color and the watercolor medium.  Turning  the pages is like watching a fabulous fireworks display.  Each page reveals  another explosion of beautiful color painting.  Like fireworks, some  paintings go off with a huge bang, and others are more muted; but each  painting has something to say -- there are no "duds."  Helpful  comments by the artists give insight as to how and why each painting was  done.  If you're an artist looking for inspiration, this book can really  give you a whack in the side of the head that will send you running to your  paints.  Even if you're not an artist, you'll enjoy the gorgeous colors and  wide, wild variety of subjects and techniques.  An astonishing book and  well worth the price	pos
I like this magazine and I subscribe to it (along with Cooking for Two and Cook's Country), but I don't think it's perfect.

But the magazine does contain ads, despite what one reviewer claimed	pos
easily one of the funniest movies ever made. its incredible today to realize that irene dunne never won an oscar, and this year is the most galling of all, as she lost to the ridiculous luise rainer in "the good earth"; and even more galling to realize that cary grant was not even nominated (after all, its only a comedy, right?) but this is a movie that will never age: it makes me laugh as much today as when i first saw it on television thirty years back, and if id been alive to see it in a theater 70 years ago, the response would be the same. dunne and grant excel as a divorcing couple who sabotage each others new relationships, and randolph scott is a miracle as dunnes new fiancee ("not oklahoma city ITSELF?!"). but it is irene dunne who is the star here, and until such time as "theodora goes wild" and "show boat" are finally released on dvd, this is the best of her 30s roles.	pos

Turf Gear is initally marketed for use with football players, well I think the year Bill Clinton became President was the last time I donned shoulder pads, but it didn't stop me from being active later in life.  With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour, I was hoping that the product would live up to the description.  A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight, yet allows your skin to breath?  Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways. ---  --- So far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.  I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling, these shirts are amazingly durable!  I feel the price is definitely worth it, excuse me while I go order more	pos
Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom'). ---  --- But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.  ---  --- Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clichéd sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché? ---  --- Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.  ---  --- We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters.	neg

Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone. ---  --- The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. --- The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. --- Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. --- As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!	neg
Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat.

I'm really not sure what the purpose of this Disc is, other than as an Adam Ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection.  This is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of "Antics in the Forbidden Zone" which detailed Adam Ant's career up until the bombastic "Apollo 9" album.  "Essential" adds the 1990 single "Room at the Top" from "Manners & Physique" album and "Wonderful" from the 1995 "Wonderful" album.  These two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and I think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums, anyway.  And of course "Essential" ignores the unreleased 1993 album "Persuasion" which had some really good songs on it.  If you want later period Adam Ant, "Manners" is really good and "Wonderful" is, well, less than wonderful, but still a worthwhile Adam Ant.  If you want an introduction to Adam Ant, the chronologically catalogued "Antics" is great and a more complete collection! 	pos
these wipes are great.  i have three children and have used the pampers, huggies, and house-brand wipes.  the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done. house-brand don't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough.  the pampers are thin, soft, and moist enough to get the job done-because they are thin, they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded / refolded for 100% useage (unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver).  definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said.  if you want something moister, go get a paper towel and wet it with water	pos

I woke up this morning to the grating sounds of "Good Little Girls" blaring over my clock radio's single, worn-out speaker.  A speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year, such as "There Goes My Life" and "Live Like You Were Dying".  "Good Little Girls" is easily the worst country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad!  Blue Country is the C&W equivalent of Wham!

I am a SJP-fan, and I was almost certain I would love the new perfume of this stylish lady. --- It isn't released yet in Holland, but I found a sample in Germany where it is already released. I was disappointed. The smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something I would like to smell like. It isn't lovely at all. It is too sporty. I expected something more flowery. The scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. So, although I am a SJP-fan, I wouldn't like to smell like her. A pity. --- My favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): Beyond Paradise (Estee Lauder), Curious (Britney Spears), Couture! (Moschino), Live (J.Lo), Tumulte (Christian LaCroix), several Escade Limited Edition Perfumes and Gucci Rush 2	neg
Along with Son Volt's "Trace" and Nadine's "Downtown Saturday," this is one of the best rock albums of the 1990s and certainly one of the best alt.country albums ever released.  Standout  tracks include "Blue Canoe," "Soul Sister," "Eyes  of a Child," "Wink" and "Let's Go Runnin'" all  examples of first class rock songwriting.  The rest ain't too shabby  either.  Fans of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd in particular  should give this Mississippi band a listen.  But so should any mainstream  rock fan	pos

What kind of magazine can you get for that age in between? To old for the "Highlights" or other kids mags and still to young (girls anyway) for Seventeen, Teen People or Young Miss...RANGER RICK!!

Filled with outstanding pictures, fun facts and great information, she enjoys it all! Highly Recommend for a gift when your not sure what to get	pos

Well it was an obvious path to musical collapse, she should have stopped at Tidal.  If I'd been dating her for the talent she showed on her first CD I would have broken up with her over this piece of haggis.  The course of the last three CD's drew a trendline right from stardom into a melodic pit.  The lyrics on Extraordinary Machine were not only not up to their namesake but worse than the melodies.  The number of great reviews on this site only go to prove once again the masses prefer pablum in lieu of something complex and cognitive. ---  --- Her original Cd with it's collection of diminished and augmented chords set to deep overlays of texturing, blended with truly poetic lyrics has been replaced with a distilled musical joke.  What on earth gave her the impetus to try to go 'artsy' by experimenting with music predating the second world war I'll never know.  It's obvious her angst is no longer producing art, rather it is being replaced with contrived resolution and the equivalent of a musical epitaph.   ---  --- Eat it up people, it's all about not having to think.  It's the kind of tripe that happens when someone is trying to hard to think of how to outdo their first brush stroke of genius and is confronted with musical block.  Judging by the news her father is ruining her life and creativity as so often is the case in todays less than feminine half of the culture.  	neg
 I recently picked this game up because the laptop I had purchased for college was finally a computer powerful enough to run it. It is easily one of the best computer games I've ever played. The playing world is massive (you can literally walk to any mountain or monument you see in the distance) and there are multiple ways to accomplish a goal and/or solve a mission. ---  --- The basic plot is this: you are Jack Carver, who has accompanied a woman to a part of Micronesia for undisclosed reasons (she turns out to be a CIA agent), and before long she is kidnapped, and you are fighting for your life against an army of well-trained mercenaries. It's a fairly generic shooter plot, but it gets the point across and ties everything together well. ---  --- The enemy AI is unbelievably good. The soldiers work together to take you down (all the while dropping hilariously bad one-liners like "HOW DO YOU LIKE THOSE APPLES??", "RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, MOFO!", "I'M GONNA TEAR YOU A NEW ONE!!"). The shootouts that result in this game are a blast: you really have to get good cover and strategize your fight. It's the first shooter I've played that makes me feel like I'm actually in an action movie. ---  --- The vehicles are one of the game's biggest highlights. If you want to move quicker downstream, you can snipe at occupants of the frequent patrol boats on the water and steal their ride. You can often obtain RVs and ATVs (and at one point in the game, a forklift for reasons unknown). These are a blast as you can drive right through the enemies firing at you. One thing I enjoy doing is driving full speed at an enemy and bailing out at the last second. Always good fun. ---  --- The game is also a great challenge. I just completed the game on the Medium setting and it was still almost impossible in places. Fighting the trigens (the small monkey-like creatures with claws) is a nightmare on any diffculty, as they can outrun and outJUMP you and kill you with, often, a single hit (I strongly suggest using the sniper rifle or a powerful machine gun other than the M4 on them at long distance before they really mess you up!) ---  --- In short, this is the best FPS I have ever played, and probably one of the best computer games ever made overall. Highly recommended. ---  --- (on a side note: not that it matters to me, but I'm personally surprised this game got a Mature rating...there is barely any blood at all, and none of it sticks on the floor. And when shot with a rocket launcher, people don't explode like normally in Mature-rated shooters. This game SHOULD have been rated TEEN)	pos
This version, bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story, but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story. The book was a simple good story, why did they abandon it  and the characters so completely? ---  --- The sets and costumes are great, but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period? ---  --- I have only watched the first disc, but it be a while before I will be able to force myself to watch the others.	neg

Having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, I was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say that if it wasn't a present I would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation. ---  --- The Good:  --- * Screen is bright, images look great --- * Resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. Doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen.  --- * Computer connection worked great - I plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. It would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue. ---  --- The bad:  --- My main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. If I bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, I could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  We live in the future here people, get with the program!   ---  --- I have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, I'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. This screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price. ---  --- Some details: --- * Menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the "setup" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global --- * Remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny IR hole in the front of the screen. --- * Screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this "feature" off. --- * The slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. Your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change. --- * No way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily  --- get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system. --- * Good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens	neg

I bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased. It is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all. The corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on. It will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with. The price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products.	pos
First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility.  --- Overall, I feel that I paid too much for this operating system.	neg
This switch works really well.  I use it between a Windows XP and Windows 98 operating systems.  When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly.  However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds.  I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC.  It frees up a port.  Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch.  It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.   --- I rate this product 5 stars.  When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2.  I recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price	neg

I had this stuff almost every day while living in Chile for 2 years. Let me tell you, there is almost no comparison with the non-fat milk we drink here in the states. This stuff is way better. Don't quote me on this, but I heard that Nido isn't 100% non-fat. That being the case, it doesn't keep as long as non-fat powdered milk. But I might be wrong. At any rate, it's worth it.

We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!

This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex, drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly.  ---  --- I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas.  ---  --- This movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.	pos
I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products. 	neg
As a student of urban development and politics, I can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind. Davis offers a hardline Marxist view of Los Angeles that, by employing simply economic analysis, does not allow for the intricacies of the city's problems.

This book is NOT about ALL people. It is about gifted (in this case that means sensitive) children that are misused to feed their parents narcissism. Most children are not that sensitive and hence not suseptible to that specific abuse. ---  --- It is possible to be gifted and not be sensitive, but those traits do trend together.  ---  --- I agree that reading this book is an emotional experience for those former children, but that is a necessary part of the healing process. ---  --- This book pioneered the idea examine this from the child's perspective, and any subsequent critics need to consider this. ---  --- I heartily recommend this book for those that have been affected, and the others should give their copy to the library, grateful not to have needed it	pos

Men's Health is one of the most popular men's magazines because it meets the various expectations and needs of the modern man. You simply have to know about fitness, dieting, supplements, fashion, gadgets, etc. The annual subscription makes it a bargain and you get so much information for a few bucks. One of the most interesting sections is the one dedicated to bedroom activities. The tips are definitely useful and yet I highly recommend in addition the bestseller "scientifically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex" for the latest secrets in this area. Another key feature of the magazine is that it motivates you to stay healthy, lean and fit. There are weight loss tips, advice on how to eat and exercise in order to see results fast. This is important part of keeping sharp appearance. Overall, I can reasonably say that you will learn a lot, have fun reading it and most probably it will help you up to a certain limit to be a good looking man and great lover	pos
I purchased this case for my DSCS90. I hate it! It is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else.

I'm a 13 handicap and I've never bought a swing trainer before, but I saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try. It arrived yesterday and I went through the warm-up and practice. First, the grip felt very uncomfortable. Over the years I had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip. This device corrected it immediately, although I didn't know it at the time. After going through the routine described in the directions I went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls. My grip still felt funny, but my tempo, swing path and release had improved 100% in just a few minutes. This morning I went to the driving range. The improvement was dramatic. My iron shots were longer and straighter, but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver. After about ten driver swings I got the hang of it... and... WOW! There's a screen out at 250 yards. On a good shot I usually hit it on one bounce. Today, I was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground. ---  --- Thanks David. I can't wait to get out on the course tomorrow	pos
Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again.

I recently decided to go through some of my old cds that I haven't listened toin ages. Dj Cheb i Sabbah's Maha Maya: Shri Durga Remixed" was one of those cds that I came upon. This was my first exposure to Indian music, let alone world music. I wasn't really familiar with music outside of western culture. So this was a new experience for me. Listening to "Maha Maya" Shri Durga Remixed" certainly takes the listener on a trip to India with its traditional Indian melodies. I envisioned myself in the Taj Mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing. The music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. It is certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. I however dug Transglobal Underground's version of "Kese Kese" (Where's the Sarangi Mix" right from the get go. It has a nice beat. Dj Cheb i Sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the music flowed well together. I am definitely curious to hear dj Cheb's other cds now that I have re-discovered this little gem of a cd	pos

I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news. I have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable, the better. I recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them (I'm in cold Chicago). They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being.  ---  --- I ordered my true size, 7.5, and these feel almost perfect, maybe just a  little roomy, but I'm not going to bother exchanging them because I'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. I haven't owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s, nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again, so I couldn't remember what size I used to wear -- but I'm very, very happy with these shoes overall	pos

As far as I can tell, even after following directions to the letter, I found the readings to be wildly inaccurate. For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79.  In the afternoon it was 188 over 155.  Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death.  At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78.

I purchased this item on 6/3/06 from Amazon, and a 250GB ATA/IDE Hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor. It all went together fine and I could mount the volume easily enough. ---  --- The first thing I noticed is that it's wi-fi wouldn't work with WEP with my Powerbook. It'd work without encryption on the Airport Extreme, but not with WEP or with WPA. I noted that and used it without the wi-fi for a few days. I noted it wouldn't hold time at all consistently. It wouldn't register a network time server's data and was always in the wrong time zone, so I had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time, but it would still drift about ten minutes per day, and then jump an hour or two randomly, making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy. ---  --- I found it slow to mount, and it would sometimes unmount over working WEP wi-fi or hardwired Gigabit connections, which was disheartening. I then decided to call Tech Support, which is when things went from bad to worse... ---  --- Calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff. The tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around, which too up to another thirty minutes. Folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e-mails.  ---  --- After *** 12 hours *** with customer support over two weeks and a not-yet-released firmware update, it would work with WPA_PSK or open, but still no WEP. They couldn't fix the time drift issue. I repeatedly asked for a replacement, but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through, whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time, or another firmware update... they just wouldn't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until I was ready to scream. By this time, I was out of Amazon's return policy timeframe. ---  --- They refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts. I even sent a letter, telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or I'd post my experience here on Amazon. Of course, I got a replacement unit with no other reply. ---  --- Now I've got to get rid of the thing oneBay or whatever, take the loss and move on. I would never buy another D-Link product. I would avoid this thing like anthrax - weaponized anthrax. ---  --- I bought an Iomega NAS unit, which works very well, has multiple drives and RAID and, though it costs more, provides decent value and it WORKS. ---  --- D-Link has a lot to learn about customer service and should NOT release beta, untested products to the consumer market.

It fits smokers that are 30" (76cm) across (perhaps including handles, not sure) and are 36" (91cm)vertically. ---  --- It's a bit big for my standard-sized smoker (about 20" across), so it is unflattering to its graceful curves, but good enough to be useful. ---  --- It is cheaply made, but looks like it will be suitable.  I will update my report if it falls apart in use (like another reviewer said). ---  --- It is quite possible that a garbage bag would be enough to protect your grill.  The main advantage here is that it fits a bit better, and has elastic to close the bottom a bit.  It probably looks a bit better, if you care	pos
I bought it coz i always wanted something like this, after i got it i just went and bought a game, i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said "i dont like games" which one should i buy, well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that I havent been able to play it too often It was taken away from me heheheheh --- So my review is his and he sais that it deserves FIVE STAR	pos
While the concept is good, there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body, so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds. I would avoid it to be honest.	neg
I put the multi-clip on my belt and the spring metal bent out of shape.

I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. --- The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be	neg
Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning is the worst in the series so far and that is saying allot. The acting is much worst then in prior movies. The script is awfull like on a police academy parts 4 and onwards level and that is nothing short of terrible. The special effects looked cheap even for the time the movie was made and the budget is like nothing close to the first couple of movie. The music is outrageously bad and is probably some of the worst 80's music I have ever heard. I love the 80's hairdoes, the tacky cheap looking clothes, and the make up is atrocious.The dialogue is so bad that one wonders if it is a highschool project gone awry. The killing scenes are also kind of lame and they seem to have run out of ideas. The movie is only 92 minutes long but it sure feels it is like at least twice as long and the plot makes no sense at all. This is a movie that has no redeeming qualities and should be avoided at all costs	neg
I bought this for an older model Graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it.  The mattress measures 27" x 39" and before washing it my husband and I tried it out to see if it fit.  It's too small.  I know it's supposed to be snug but the mattress won't even lay flat with this sheet on it.  It seems like it'd be a great product, if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly.  	neg
This dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of Christianity; it discusses an alternate viewpoint (as Dan Brown reminds us "the winners write the history books")This dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with; esp. the idea of God as male, and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership. This dvd includes interviews with Dan Burstein, Henry Lincoln, Martin Lunn, Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, Dr. Karen Ralls, Dr. James Robinson, and Margaret Starbird. I particularly liked Margaret Starbird's interviews - she describes how when she first read "Holy Blood, Holy Grail", she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal Catholic. But afterward, she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research Mary Magdalene and write "The Woman with the Alabaster Jar". She comes across as very rational, sensible and even heroic. It takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority. I thought Dan Burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of Jewish people during the time Jesus lived. I think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that doesn't mean it is necessarily the truth. To be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live	pos

This book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses.  I practically wore mine out over a year-long course, and came to know it intimately.  Dummit and Foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples.  Of course, examples are very important.  However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products).  They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor.  Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them.  Also, the bindings on this book frequently fail.  My book fell apart very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem.  I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit and Foote.	neg

I stumbled upon this game years ago, and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends, who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids' game.  This past year, I decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom.  I must say...WOW.  I allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom, and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the Frog Juice.  They would even play it over other outdoor games at recess.  Anytime you heard a "NOOOO!" in the room, you knew someone had pulled out the Witch Wash.  The kids LOVED it. ---  --- So, I have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year.  To any educators who might be reading this, it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime, and because of the math and bit of strategy involved, you don't feel guilty about it at all.  Plus, it is something different and for the teacher, inexpensive as far as games go	pos

As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.  ---  --- I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way. ---  --- Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche. ---  --- Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight.  ---  --- I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat.  ---  --- That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer. ---  --- The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm. ---   --- I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway. ---  --- I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himsef, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook.  ---  --- Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose. ---  --- Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight. ---  --- The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away	neg
I'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers.  I run around the house in socks.  I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up	pos
The best edition so far,however... --- The color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater. A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any serious collector	pos

Then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games. They were NOT intuitive and then THUD. He lost interest and has not returned to the LMax since.

"Koyaanisqatsi" took seven years to make, from 1975 to 1982. There is not a narration to tell you what to think. This is an art film, in my opinion, the value is up to the viewer: Is this film meaningful? Does it have value? As a viewer I say yes. This film is a fusion of music and image. In Koyaanisqatsi there are 17 pieces of music and five movements all have relative relationship to one another. The "Grid" is a polyrhythmic piece of music. There are 11 polyrhythimic structues going on at once, and it matches with the time lapsed photography that is occuring on screen. About 350,000 feet of film was shot. There definitely was a method to this madness: after the explosion of the Grid, these polyrhythmic structures settle the audience down and the film ends the way it began: a rocket ship taking off. --- Godfrey Reggio more than expected a negative reaction by some people when he made this film.  --- What does this film mean? That is up to the viewer, like a piece of art work there may be a thousand or more interpretations related to this film. Is this film only for certain individuals? Probably. But I don't think there is any pretense in interpretating this films message. One does not have to pretend to like or dislike an art object; it has no intrisic meaning or value only what can be ascribed to it by the viewer. --- Godfrey stated that Koyaanisqatsi is related to Northern Hemisphere societies; super-sophisticated, hyper-industrial, technological grids that we call societies.  --- To me this film is about how humans have become one with machines. And how we don't live with nature any longer. We have become not affected by technology so much more that we have become so engrained in it we can no longer see out of it. That technology becomes the host in which everything happens and in that way, we do not use technology, it is a way of life. But like the air we breath we can not distance ourselves, as we deny that we are separate from technology and instead of moving us toward control of nature it has alienated us instead. The norms of nature no longer fully exist; it is rather the norms of technology that do. And in so doing technology has become omnipresent. Personally I don't have to pretend to like this film or pretend it is important. In fact it is, as its message is perhaps even more significant today as the world moves even closer to a homogenized society at the expense of natural and human diversity.This film shows that homogenization is in this process of globalization	pos
This is a highly informative and accurate book.  It presents the data in a clear and graphic form, with a minimum of statistical manipulation.

It seems the last few Office releases I have purchased haven't really offered anything different, but this one does.  The interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to.  I would suggest upgrading to Office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project.

I have found the many of the same things to be true as the previous reviewer.  If you want a brighter Elixir, they also make NanoWeb versions with a lighter coating.  They do wear out quicker though. ---  --- Before I started using Elixirs, my favorite strings were D' Addario 80/20 Phosphor Bronze.  I could get 3 sets for the price of 1 set of Elixirs.  I really found the Elixir's price to be a bit of a shock, but used them for a few months.  On a whim, I went back to the other strings.  I never noticed how quickly they oxidized and went dead before!  I've gone back and stayed with Elixir. ---  --- I've also tried the D' Addario EXP and Dean Markley Alchemy coated strings.  They were okay, but I found the Elixirs looked and sounded better longer. ---  --- Downsides? The uncoated strings show wear spots and oxidize long before the coated ones.  Also, as the coating wears off, I've found the strings get "fuzzy."  Overall, I still end up changing stings a lot less than I used to.  One star deducted for the high price. ---  ---  	pos
 If you believe in the Devil, and I mean *really* believe in the devil, I can't think of one good reason why you'd want to summon the Devil into this world. At worst, he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter. ---  --- Yet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts. ---  --- The movie is based on the novel "The Club Dumas" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed. ---  --- I can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore. ---  --- A mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty. ---  --- Also, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a "quota substitute". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult. ---  --- I love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged. ---  --- In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions. ---  --- I would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles. There's no excuse, in this day and age, for a mainstream DVD not to offer subtitles.	neg

Car and Driver is definitely the best automotive magazine in the world. This magazine has something for everybody, whether your a person just looking for a new car or a serious car enthusiast. I have been a Car and Driver sucscriber for 6 years now and I regularly purchase the other three popular, monthly car magazines (Motor Trend, Road & Track, and Automobile). By far Car and Driver is the best of the four, testing more automobiles per issue (about least twice as many as Road & Track per year), conducting larger comparison tests, and generally being the most enjoyable. Car and Driver is also greater fun to read as the editors are very prone to jokes and wisecracks, and not afraid to write how they really feel about a car, no matter how good or bad it is. The road tests are comprehensive with a long list of tests performed for every vehicle, and the good points and bad points listed along with a sentence summary of the vehicle. All the reviews are unbiased (mostly), and all vehicles are compared to similar cars in the same class. The bottom line: If you want a magazine that tests more motor vehicles than any other American car magazine, prints accurate specifications and performance tests results on each one, and includes autosport articles and up to date auto news, yet you don't want to fall asleep reading it,  Car and Drvier is the magazine for you.     ---  	pos

I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics. ---  I have also shot some pics of waterfalls (slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image) and portraits of people and again, it oozed excellence. The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom, but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience	pos
My daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It combines the classic board and memory games together.  The pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable.  The only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily.  We have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box.  An excellent game!!	pos
Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot	pos
it gets laughs in its comicness in certain scenes --- it gets shocks --- like the beginning war scenes and the fight scenes --- it gets more interesting as the plot unravels --- great actors picked for such roles --- the perfect killing machines --- one insane in the brain --- and one out to save lives that shouldn't be lost in the first place --- the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and the soldier says "I just want to eat, I don't wanna hurt you, then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal. and his reporter female friend comes in and says "good meal" as a question that is. and he says without words "makes a happy sigh" that's hilarious. and how she looks around and see everyone who got their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food --- priceless movie --- worth the watch again and again --- I'm glad I saw this on tv when I was younger --- and I'm glad I got this on dv	pos

I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey. I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on. I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support. When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet. I have no problem with range of motion. I still had a hard time getting this bra on. Not to mention, I was falling out all over the place. I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money. I would recommend "Jogbra" or "Chamion" for less money, better fit and better hold if you are big busted.	neg

A comedy with a bitter sweet edge, "The Purple Rose of Cario" has a fairly simple premise. Cecilia (Mia Farrow) struggles to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Her husband Monk (Danny Aiello)is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and Cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent. The only escape that Cecilia has is going to the movies--the fantasy world of Hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world. Her favorite movie "The Purple Rose of Cario" featuring Gil Shepard (Jeff Daniels) as Tom Baxter (also Jeff Daniels in a dual role)changes her life when the character Tom Baxter walks out of the movie into the real world. He says he's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except Cecilia's sister cares about. The rest of the characters in the film (Edward Herrman,Milo O'Shea, Deboarh Rush, Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Van Johnson)are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is.  ---  --- "Purple Rose" is one of Allen's most complete films and captures all the wistfulness that lurks in the background of his films. This DVD looks extremely good considering that the transfer is from 2001. There's some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly on screen but, on the whole, it's not a big deal. Allen hasn't done commentary tracks are allowed extras on his releases which is too bad as there's cut footage of Viggo Mortensen and Michael Keaton (who was originally cast in the lead instead of Daniels)that would be of interest. I don't know if that footage still exists but if it did it would make a lovely addition to this. Why MGM didn't choose to include archieved footage of Allen talking about the film and new interviews with the stars is beyond me. This Oscar nominated (for Best Screenplay)film certainly deserves a documentary on its making or, at the very least, a featurette. We do get the original theatrical trailer and a booklet that discusses the making of the film.  ---  ---  --- A great movie that will hopefully get better treatment when it ends up on the Blu-Ray format, "Purple Rose" is still a treat and well worth picking up. It's also priced well at $12-14 at most retail outlets and at amazon.com	pos
I set the buner in the backyard, fire it up. The Jet engine equivalence heats up extremely quick, and I finished sauteeding meat/vegie in no time.

Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it. --- I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better. ---  --- DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic. --- Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better	neg
For the price, you get a lot out of this camera. 6X zoom Stabilized,  the images comes out great at full zoom (2 stabilization mode).  The aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture.  The multiple program modes, just about lets you take a great picture under different situation! Controls are easy to use and get to. In all definitely a great buy for the price.  The down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the DMC-LZ5 or a camcorder. --- 	pos

These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel! --- I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.   --- The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt	pos
We had the Diaper Dekor Plus and it seems that I'm the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell.  The first couple of months weren't bad, but after about 3 months or so, it really started to smell bad.  This horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on. ---  --- We tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell-letting it "air out" outside, cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution, putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner, letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water...we even bought some scented disc type things (can be purchased at Babies R Us) that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse. ---  --- We continued to use it, but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with Lysol or something.  Eventually we used it less and less, and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago-we'd had it for almost 2 years.  We knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn't get rid of it.  It was a real shame because aside from the smell, it was a great product	neg
I've had my 360 since day one, and it's been worth every dollar.  Let me start by saying there is NOTHING, nothing that compares to Xbox Live on the 360.  Microsoft knows online gaming, they know the gamer.  By the end of the month you will be able to download High Def Movies for rent, and tv shows for free.  The online community is set up to help guide you to gamers like yourself, and people with your skill level.  Sony can't do this, and Ninendo can't do this.  They will try, but the Xbox has been doing this for years now starting with the original xbox.   ---   --- As for the so called problems?  All systems have them in the first couple months of release, it happenend to the Gamecube, PS2, and as we are seeing the PS3.  I do also want to mention that the poster who said not to put the 360 verticle, does not have a clue.  You can put it verticle, or horizontal, and it works just fine.  As it turns out, many systems were crashing because people got scared of the rumours, and bought the nyko cooler.  It in turn is now being reported, and back with pictures, etc. that IT was causing many 360's to burn out, and it had nothing to do with any 360 problems. ---  --- I personally have the 360, and soon a Nintendo Wii, and I have to say in the overall scheme of things...Games, Online network, options, accessories, etc.   ---  --- You can't beat the Xbox 360. Not only that, the sony hype machine wants to tell you that it's graphics are better.  In reality, programmers, and 3rd party developers are saying they are equal in graphical power, but you are force fed lies and hype from the Sony side. Not to mention a much higher price tag. ---  --- With all the bs sony, and fanboys throw out there.  The 360 is a worthy buy!  You really can't go wrong with the 360, buy the premium, and get the best game out there...Gears of War!	pos
This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics.  	pos
I might as well re-draft this review as only 0 of 2 people enjoyed the first draft.  That's wouldn't normally phase me, but I can do better for you in this case.   ---  --- I first saw a segment of ST-2 on cable and mistook it for an anemically budgeted direct-to-DVD release.  This ticked me off a bit because I'm a fan of Phil Tippett, who got his major feature film directorial shot on this movie.   ---  --- Having now got the DVD, I have unreeled it from the beginning and I find it loads more ambitious, intelligent and well rendered by director Tippett than I had given the producers credit for permitting. ---  --- Tippett has been an innovator in the CGI field -- stop-motion, go-motion, and transitional model-to-CGI models manipulated so as to provide dynamic effects for an impressive array of digital creatures. Among those milestones are the perfectly convincing insect creatures in the first STARSHIP TROOPERS movie. The multitudes of individually rendered creatures in STARSHIP TROOPERS are spotlessly realistic.   ---  --- As a general rule, if a studio greenlights a movie sequel as a direct-to-DVD release, they intend to suffocate the production -- whether the franchise has been good, bad or mediocre in the market -- by simply failing to provide a generous -- or even a minimal budget -- to sustain life support in any recognizable way.  Trust me -- starve any sequel of support and money and you become a key factor in ruining even the best of franchises.   ---  --- STARSHIP TROOPERS (the first) was not a runaway commercial hit on first run, apparently, when compared to its $100 million cost.  But sci-fi buffs are a loyal film audience with eternal memories, and it is certain that this ambitious sci-fi production will continue to attract countless repeated viewings -- and income -- for the rest of the studios' and the filmmakers' natural lives.  Nobody loses on this one.  A sequel is hardly a big gamble if one invests long-term.   ---  --- Regardless of that, director Phil Tippett has not only done an impressive job of directing his first major film, he has also done a very smart job of producing a generous portion of images large in scope and convincing in power within his spare budget.   ---  --- Looking at the bug war scenes in the first act, you might easily not suspect there were any production restrictions at all.  Credit Mr. Tippett for that achievement.  In fact, there are moments that benefit from lessons learned in the first movie, which have added impact as a result.   ---  --- Now for a few notes:  I would have liked to see the bug culture and biology expanded in new, logical ways.  I would like to have seen bug life-cycle mechanics which did not rehash ground covered by other unrelated movies -- what has been done and re-done in sci-fi productions as far back as ALIEN.   ---  --- The creative possibilities for an intelligent multiped, exoskeleton, hive-bred civilization are unlimited.  There is no need at all for the writers or FX techs to resort to the over-used and tired gimmick of an alien climbing from one human's mouth to another human mouth, for example.   ---  --- Nor do we need yet another script in which we revisit the old familiar premise of films from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS to THE HIDDEN to THE THING that anyone can be inhabited by an alien and still appear normal.  It has been done to death.  Let's move on and discard that whole much copied process.   ---  --- I could tell you things about the way a crawdad captures and eats a minnow from the tail forward that would make your hair stand on end. There is plenty of fresh, untapped bug behavior to mine, and there is far too much writing talent involved with the STARSHIP TROOPERS series to need to use anything rehashed from any previous motion picture.  ---  --- Still in all, Phil Tippett's feature debut as director is more than competent and particularly surprising for his facility with the actors.  I look forward to his future development as a director.   --- 	neg
Mr. Fleishman has written and clear and concise primer on Home Theater.

my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back	neg
The ring and motor do what they are supposed to do.  The ring did not fit very well, at first, it was able to rock back and forth.  However, after a little bending into shape, it fit more snug.  The way the ring rests on the kettle, there will alway be some gap, which does not allow for a good seal.  I not only use this as a rotisserie, but also to give me more room for beer can chicken.  Its worth getting it for the added flexibility.	pos

At last!  A full-length Jimmy Buffett concert on DVD!  It's been a while coming but this is a beauty.  There are so many highlights it's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the DVD.  The sound is superb, the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a Jimmy Buffett concert is captured perfectly.  The song mix is terrific - everything from Buffett classics like Volcano, to new classic like Piece Of Work, to iconic covers like Southern Cross.  Seeing Jimmy and the Coral Reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a Buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience!  For me, a favourite moment is the concert finale of Steve Goodman's City Of New Orleans.  Steve now resides under home plate at Wrigley and I'm sure he was singing along as well.  Buffett fans and new Parrotheads alike will find this DVD one to watch many times over	pos

I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve!

I was worried this looked cheap, and too sterile and hospital-like for my new baby, but it is much more attractive in person. Safetly 1st needs to have a new photo taken of this crib, theirs looks dated. It arrived and took less than five minutes to assemble, by myself at 8 months pregnant! Completely assembled except for sliding the four leg castors into place and lifting the bars to an open position. Click- Done! Has two adjustable height settings, and comes with a nice mattress. I would not order another one. This is very soft and suitable. This rolls easily and the pack and play bedding fits it perfectly. The Eddie Bauer sheets from Target come in a fleece fabric that is extremely soft, love it! My crib skirt from a large crib fits with adjustments and I love the way it turned out. In fact I can't believe this is one of the cheapest alternatives, since I would say it is nicer than the wooden mini-cribs I saw in person at a local store.  ---  --- I have a 24 month old and I did not want two cribs, but I also did not want to rush her into a toddler bed. We bought one, but she doesn't want to stay in it at night. She feels safe and sleeps well in her crib.  ---  --- This crib is stable and will be fine for our second child until the older baby is out of her crib. This is a great product and very reasonable too!	pos
Possibly one of the worst movies ever made, Bo and John Derek managed to massacre the Tarzan legend while wreaking cinematic havoc with this unbelievably bad waste of celluloid.

As China re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century, much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world. Oddly, the fascism of the Communist regime remains largely in place in the era following Mao's disastrous reign, even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge, heavily-populated, and (from a Western perspective)oftentimes strange land. Aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of Christianity in China, as well as introducing readers to the many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country. On a recent trip to China, I was highly impressed by the deep generosity, humility, resourcefulness, strength, perseverance, and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all ages. This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith. This spirit is also, I believe, one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many Chinese. Also, those who are concerned that a "Christian China" would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a Westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy. It seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly Chinese way	pos

The reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best, so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [I might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured (and no longer airborne) housefly buzzing in circles]. With respect to the heat(ing), it does perform better, but is by no means stellar.  ---  --- The Pro's are its design for moisture, a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off.  ---  --- The Con's include, as others have said, a HUGE AC-DC plug/power pack, no apparent ability to WASH the darn thing, only modest heat, annoying Velcro straps, a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together, but can't be removed from the main pad for washing AND, perhaps most significantly, the fact that mine died after approx. 18 months (which, incidentally, raises yet another detractor; the Warranty is only a year, much less than many other brands)	neg

With the birth of our first child, there were tons of little toys lying around all the time, from teethers to rattles, stuffed lovies and blocks.  The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space, so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside, how sturdy it was, and how much our baby loved looking at it!   With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin, there is even a fold out flap with a play space, and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket.  The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble "shingles."  This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips.   Best of all, there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside!  It is soft and collapsible, yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys.  It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed, but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy.  I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys.  I give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional	pos

If you haven't heard the Dead Live then start with this or Live Dead.  ---  --- You will realise why to many they were America's greatest improvisational rock band. The playing, the interplay between the musicians - particularly Garcia and Lesh is staggering. And how about a big hand for Bill Kreutzman on drums	pos
I bought this lens to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.  I absolutely love this lens.  I got it to try some insect and other macro shots and it has served this purpose very well.  With some practice this lens will produce fantastic macros with some great bokeh to boot.   --- I read the other reviews and must say that I have never scared an insect away with the noise as mentioned before.  And I have taken countless insect shots with this lens.  It is a bit louder than the other lenses I have but I don't see it to be a problem.  The one problem I do encounter is when using the autofocus in a busy closeup scene it often will focus on the background instead of say a closer insect on a flower.  When this happens I just flip it to manual and focus that way.  No big deal. --- Overall, great lens for an even greater price.  Definitely worth it.  (I submitted a photo of a bee that I took a couple of days ago with this lens as an example.)  	pos
I found La Ciudad a very different movie from any other movies I have wathched. This movie is split into four narratives of Latino immigrants living in the city of New York. Immigrants come to the US with many dreams in their minds. These dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education, getting rich, and living a happy and high standard life. This movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government. This movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations. For example, Luis's daughter Dulce cannot get addmission to school, and Ana cannot do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with Ana. I like it how the movie is shown in black and white; it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie. It also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the US, they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations. Overall, I really liked the movie and I would encourage anyone to see it	pos
This is a new low, even for our feminazi-drenched anti-culture.  The whole message of this whore of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being superficial, arrogant, shallow and slutty are positive attributes, desirable & healthy, and that by contrast, having true strength of character, integrity, honor and modesty are for 'losers.'  In other words, looking and behaving like a skank tramp = "empowerment."  That term has been SO misued over the last 30 years (and particularly the last 10), that it ceases to have any truth to it whatsoever.  Barbie used to epitomize what it meant to be feminine, a lady, and fulfilled -- with a husband, a home and children.  Now that standard has been completely perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this -- exchanging true values (being a good wife and mother) for false ones (materialism and promiscuity).  Even Barbie's face has been uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner and collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out Bratz dolls.  Realize -- this is a WAR on our children's souls! ---  --- Mattel should be ashamed of themselves, to the hilt.  This is child abuse, pure and simple.  Any mother who allows their child to get one of these monstrosities should be jailed for neglect and have her tubes tied	neg
(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in "Batman Begins;" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's "Spider-Man") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's "Superman" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.	pos
Like the other reviewer, I have this clock in my office - in my case in the middle of a warehouse. ---  --- Within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date.  It has been in wireless contact ever since (there is an icon to let you know) ---  --- The time numerals are a little over 2" high and very clear - easy to read from 50' away.  The day, date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear, but since they are so much smaller they don't have quite the distance visability. ---  --- It is nice to have a clock around that is always right - keeps my meetings on time - no arguement over whose watch is correct	pos
 ---        Tried and true might well describe the products offered by Caswell-Massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy.  Established in 1752, it's America's oldest Chemist and Perfumer.  My grandmother enjoyed their products, and I do, too. ---  ---  Their Almond & Aloe Liquid Soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so.  Far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy. ---  ---  Almond, as we  know, has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties.  Combine it with aloe which contains healing properties, and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser. ---  ---  Other ingredients include Vitamins A and D for nourishment.  This soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin. ---  ---  Other items in Caswell-Massey's Almond & Aloe line include Body Balm, Bath Seltzer, Cold Cream Soap, Hand Cream, Hand & Body Emulsion, and Almond Body Splash	pos
I am also a longtime subscriber, and I am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine. I have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances, if you will (I would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me). Anyway, please read: ---  --- I am a current subscriber, and was quite suprised by Discover's new look (to all reading this review on Amazon.com: Amazon.com does NOT display the updated version of what Discover currently looks like). I didn't quite care for it, but as long as the material stayed the same I was going to be allright with it. Unfortunately, the articles in Discover have degenerated into "Top 20 things you didn't know about..." lists, piles of trivia, some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news. Sure, reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous. Is it appropriate for what Discover stood for or what I have expected from this magazine? I would disagree. Occasionally there is an intelligent article. The cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the Old Discover. I really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox. I've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition I possibly could because I truly did enjoy reading them, and still do. Maybe this new Discover is for a "new generation" or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers, but I think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse. I think the ordinary person, the "lay man" if you will, would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new, interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community. I remember the String Theory article (I forget which issue exactly) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.It was very exciting, and most importantly it [i]got me interested in the science[/i]. I doubt I will ever see anything that good from Discover magazine again. I'd really hate to give up on this magazine: all I ask is for the old Discover back.	neg

all things aside, the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a supporting actor. his name is justin goncalves i think. this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played. in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid. believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had. i was particularly impressed with the part he played.	pos

A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors.	neg

My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day.  I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy.  The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places.  The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit.  I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy.  I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better.  Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality. 	neg

There's a lot of different opinions of Madden NFL 07 swirling around so I figured I get in on it as well. For my money, to just have a new football game is worth it. Seeing as how Madden is now the only football game available from year to year, if you don't like Madden's brand of video games then I feel so sorry for you. However, I think this is a great installment. By no means is this the best released but there's no doubt that it's a lot of fun. ---  --- Have Madden 06? You basically have 07. Not a lot has changed from last year. The few things are the running options (juking and whatnot) being moved to the right joystick, the 50 yard dash on the training camp, and the new camera angle for your Superstar linebacker. Also, while I've only played a quarter of an exhibition game and a lot of Superstar games, I still have yet to hear John Madden. I don't know if he's not on this game or not, but if he isn't that just makes no sense. ---  --- Pros: --- It's still Madden --- Linebacker view --- Overall Superstar: Hall Of Fame feature --- Having all the big name rookies is kind of nice ---  --- Cons: --- It hasn't changed much from last year ---  --- Yeah, that's my only big complaint. I can't help but love this game though. If you're looking to save money then there's no huge reason to buy this unless you HAVE to play with Leinart, Young, Bush, and Williams, then by all means check this out. However, if not having those guys doesn't bother you then you really don't need this year's game	pos

as someone said in an earlier review, the movie is split up into two parts.  the first part, training camp, was good. i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam.  after that, i found it unwatchable. the main character is so annoying, i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast. if you're looking for a good war movie, look elsewhere.	neg
These glasses were a bit of a disappointment.  The convenience was out weighed by the uncomfortable fit - they were really snug with no possibility of adjustment.  And actually they were annoying with how they hung when not in use.  Great idea but maybe some "fine tuning" would help...like a more flexible strap rather than the plastic frame just being super long to go around your neck.	neg

The bundleme is a must for any mom. It works so well! It really does eliminate the need for coats or even jackets. The first time I used it I thought my daughter might get a little chilly on the top half so I put a jacket on her. As soon as I was indoors and took her out of the bundleme I saw that she was too warm. She was actually sweating. Ever since then I use it without anything else and she stays very warm and cozy. We have lots of snow and cold winters where I live and the bundleme original was perfect. No more fussing with a blanket that gets kicked off the moment your baby is in the back seat of the car. The top piece also has the option to zip all the way off so if it's the only part that needs washed you don't have to take the straps out of the bottom piece. You can also unzip both sides to keep from over heating your baby if you'll be indoors for a short period of time. I think that every mom should have one and I would definitely buy one again	pos

This is a chase movie, a kind of film-noir without the black and white. Here the ordinary man is Jeff Goldblum, a guy so so unhappy with his mundane job and cheating wife that he spends his nights driving the LA streets instead of sleeping. One night he finds himself in the wrong place at the right time. He interrupts the murder of a beautiful and mysterious Michelle Pfeifer and very shortly he finds himself her unwilling accomplice as both evade her ruthless pursuers. She warns him right up front that she is "one of the bad guys", but he's hooked. The chase takes them to all of the "mink-lined sewers" of after dark LA and lets them encounter quirky and sometimes violent characters. This movie plays like a mix of dark comedy and thriller.It has a plot twist of sorts, but does not end darkly. The cameos will be interesting to film buffs, but not to anyone else. It's Goldblum, Pfeifer, and the chase that drives this movie. And thankfully, the story - though improbable - strings tightly together and does not involve stupid car chases, explosions, or wanton killing. In fact, the violence is tame by today's standards. There's the brief nudity seen in 80's movies and occasional mild profanity. A nice film to rent. I bought it	pos

I like this dress. I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown, with even a little extra. I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more "trim fit" look. It is basically like a super long tank with body contour. Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on, but also want to look good in it. (It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt, if you understand what I am saying). It is soft, comfortable, cozy, beautiful color. I am very pleased with this product.	pos
I forced myself to finish this book before I reviewed it, and being through with it now, I feel as though I've learned very little.  I had so many problems with this book, or rather the way of writing, mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author, that this was a difficult read.  In his defense, he is, in MOST things, very thorough.  My main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what Leonardo was (or as he sometimes put it "must have been") thinking or feeling.  While I give Mr. Bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject, in my opinion, that still gives him no right to use what I understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views.  Since he himself stresses that Leonardo's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings, he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations.  In the instances that there is a controversy over some area of Leonardo's life, the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter, but only puts forward his OWN opinion, and his reasons why he believes what he does, without explaining the opposite side of the matter.  In this manner, he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter.  Sentences beginning with "I think" or "In my view" are not uncommon.  He also makes certain assumptions about the reader, referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them.  Also, he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of Leonardo's, often drawing attention to coloring or texture, without ever showing it, though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout.  The author is an undoubtedly intelligent, well-learned man, very erudite where Leonardo da Vinci is concerned, but entirely overbearing in his writing.  Overall, unless you are well versed in the Renaissance artists and don't mind being pulled out of a book by the author's VIEWS, then I would HIGHLY suggest staying away from this one	neg

I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.

Though this is a portable grill, it is terrific for at home use if you're single, or have a small balcony apartment. It takes very little space, and is easy to maneuver when cleaning time comes. ---  --- We took ours to a picnic this weekend and grilled two packs of hot-dogs at once (16 thick dogs). Because the grill is small, things get hot quick, and you will need to be careful with easy to burn foods that should take longer to cook. Burgers do well, steaks do fantastic. Chicken needs a a watchful eye. ---  --- I've used this gem for years. My apartments, on the whole, mandated the simplicity and efficiency offered up by the Smokey Joe.  ---  --- A great feature is the rounded top. This enables better smoking, as air and smoke circulates more fluidly.  ---  --- The downsides:  --- The legs aren't as sturdy as they could be. Given time, a bit of bumping around and general abuse, and the screwed on legs might turn askew. If you notice this while the grill is hot, you've a problem. The solution is to keep them tight during nonuse.  ---  --- The air intake at the bottom gets clogged with ashes. A key to good charcoal grilling is the manipulation of air flow. The intake might be open, but stopped up. If you are diligent to clean the ashes, you'll be OK.  ---  --- Because the grill is so close to the ground, you need to be careful. Unlike most of Weber's grill, this one is also apt to getting kicked over, run into by dogs, cars and children.  ---  --- I fully recommend Weber's Smokey Joe. Now, I'm hungry. Time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats.  ---  --- Anthony Trendl  --- editor, HungarianBookstore.co	pos
This was one of the worst group performances I have ever seen! Unbelievable that Disney has financed this "Hack Act". And the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of Disney. Save your money for a better movie	neg

I bought these crackers because I love cheese and seeds/nuts and am a low carb dieter.  They are very good and I would have given them 5 stars except I actually liked the crackers without the cheese better.  These are great for an occasional cruncy/crispy treat and I would purchase them again.  They have a less "sweet" taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild, not artificial or too salty.  I highly recommend them. 	pos
Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.  ---  --- This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended	pos
Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller.  On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side.  I didn't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either.  I would not recommend this product. It's very cumbersome. When I returned it to the store, there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently.   --- 	neg
I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back. ---  --- Also, it seems you have to hold your wrist up facing the sky if you want a reading.  Too bad, the watch sounded so good..	neg
This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days. ---  --- I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up	neg
RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN... DO NOT TRY!  Okay, so I bought in to the hype of "Blow Out".  Once I saw the "JONATHAN" product line on the shelf, I thought, "Hmmm, how yummy!"  Boy, was I disappointed.  The moisturizing shampoo was anything but!  The product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue.  Once applied to the hair, I felt knots forming.  Upon rinsing, my hair like it had been stripped!  I used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act, but was left aghast when I rinsed and felt the "new" texture of my hair.  I couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until I applied a leave in conditioner from another product line!  Once dry, my hair felt gritty, brittle and generally nasty.  I'M TAKING THIS STUFF BACK AND DEMANDING A REFUND!  I'm going back to my Frederick Fekkai products immediately	neg
Used this book all of the time in my German classes!  Wish I had had this sooner, would have made everything a lot simpler.  Its easy to use, easy to understand, and great when you need to find something quick.  This should be a book every college student, studying German, should be required to have	pos
it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there. Some of them include the anoying "click button" interface, and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve. Other than that, it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline	pos

I was a little leary about purchasing this product, having never tried anything like it before and being fairly new to the computer world.

This magazine is devoted to American inventions and technology that have affected our lives.  In essence, this magazine is a historical magazine about American technology.  Within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention.  The articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology.  Typically, each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society.   ---  --- The scope of the magazine is broad.  There have been articles on the Trans-Canada highway.  Another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines.  In yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines.  The contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned, an interesting piece of trivia of which I was previously unaware. ---  --- The scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences.  Biology and the development of medical technology are also covered.  While the magazine is written at a level that an educated non-expert can understand, some of the biology related articles challenge my attention. ---  --- This magazine is an excellent source of technological history.  However, while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology, this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field.  As an example, I had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works.  Therefore, while I highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology, realize that for some readers, for example elementary school students, this magazine could present a reading challenge. ---  --- Most articles also provide pictures or other artwork.  Frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history.  The quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well-preserved, but in many cases they are the only pictures available. ---  --- This magazine frequently mentions the Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, which is sponsored by the United States Patent & Trademark Office.  A number of articles have covered inductees to the Inventor's Hall of Fame, showing that while the articles are historical in nature, they are also currently relevant. ---  --- There are a large number of magazines that are either about technology, or have had articles about technology.  There are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology.  Sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention.  However, the "American Heritage of Invention & Technology" is the only magazine of which I am aware the covers the history of invention and technology.  While the focus of the articles is American technology, it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of American technology.  I consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology, and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines.	pos

I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.

Revolver's competing magazines in the heavy metal magazine world are Hit Parader and Circus. I have bought all three of these magazines several times, and Revolver my final judgement is Revolver is the only magazine that is good enough to subscribe to. The other two I still buy occasionally, but only for wallpaper (I cut out the pictures of bands in the magazines and hang them in my room.)  ---  ---  This magazine is, in a way, like a combination of Circus and Blender magazines; it combines the best aspects of both. Revolver still has plenty of great pictures, but it is also much longer and much better written than Circus. It is not quite as long or stuffed full of information as Blender, but make sure you note that Revolver only reports on one genre (heavy metal!) whereas Blender could (theoretically) report on every genre (rap, pop, rock, etc.) ---  ---  Chances are, if a hard rock band (especially a big name hard rock band) is about to or has already released a C.D., Revolver will do a story about it. The stories/reports are very entertaining but they also are informative and sometimes a lesson is learned from them. If it's a cover story, an interview with the band is also included; if it's not a cover story, the writer integrates quotes and answers from the band into the article, anyways (even though it's not a formal interview). Revolver writers frequently go on tour with a band (i.e. Lamb of God). In that case, they take the reader backstage, on the tour bus, and in a concert (with a rundown of the show). ---  ---  When I first started reading this magazine, there was a sexual theme to it. There would be a picture of a "hot babe" in a T-shirt, and one side of the poster would be a woman-usually half-naked-in a sexual pose. In the past year or so, Revolver phased that out (probably to appeal to a broader audience). I sometimes miss the pictures of the "hot babes," but this way there's more room for real heavy metal pictures. Yet, even though sex isn't a theme anymore, Revolver is probably a bit too sophisticated for anyone younger than a teenager. Plus, there are usually profanities (mainly the "f word.") So, I would say this magazine is for ages 13 and up. ---  --- Monthly articles: ---  --- -Cover story --- -3 or 4 other biggish stories --- - "Fresh Blood" column (where a small biography is given on a band you probably haven't heard of) --- - Ask Vinnie (an column where readers write questions, and Pantera/Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul gives advice) --- - Hard rock news and notes --- - Black and death metal news and notes --- - "In the studio" (an update on bands currently recording new music) --- -Free poster (in the middle of the magazine, there's a fold-out poster of one or two bands.) The poster isn't very wide, but it is about two pages long --- -Free music downloads --- -"Ink Spot" (a story about a musician's favorite tattoo) --- -"Favorite sh*t" (an interview with a musician, with questions such as "What's your favorite color?") --- -Joke from a band (Revolver has just recently started doing this) --- - Reviews (reviews of C.D.'s, music DVD's, and video games) ---  ---  --- Pros: ---  --- --Plenty of good pictures and a free poster --- --Professionally written with well known writers (yet it is NOT too intelligent for teenagers) --- --Edited well (I haven't found any mistakes or typos) --- -The "fresh blood" column usually introduces me to a band I haven't heard of, but I should probably check out --- --Revolver is accredited and well known enough to be allowed to go on tours with bands and be first for interviews --- --News columns (on both mainstream and underground metal bands) --- -The stories are always done with quotes from the band that the report is on --- --Free music! (Revolver has started doing a page that gives the reader a password, which he/she can then access free music downloads online.) --- --No stupid questions in interviews (they ask up to date questions, and sometimes-i.e. in the interview with Puddle of Mudd-the writers aren't afraid to ask daring, cutting questions) --- --The "In the studio" segment is always informative --- --Helpful, reliable reviews (they don't automatically praise every heavy metal C.D.) ---  ---  --- Cons: ---  --- --If you're up to date on your music news web sites, the news columns shouldn't really be anything new to you. --- --Not all C.D.'s are reviewed (they give a rundown on the C.D. in the article about the band, but C.D.'s from bands that are on the cover of the magazine aren't usually reviewed.)  --- -Concerts aren't reviewed --- -My biggest gripe is that it's only issued once a month. ---  ---  The bottom line is, if you're a metalhead, this is the best magazine you can get! It is more than well worth the ten dollars you will spend for a years worth of entertainment	pos

Imagine buying this CD after seeing "The Mirror has Two Faces" fully expecting the SOUNDTRACK music to the movie, and reading overall great reviews on Amazon.  Imagine the shock of receiving the CD and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - The remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse. Perhaps Barbara, with her tremendous unlimited wealth, felt she would be giving away a "free album" to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film. Shameless misrepresentation	neg
My son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift.  However one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that.

I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.

The shade I use is Subtle Lips. I love it! It gives some color but not so much that I feel done up. I could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great. And yet it looks great on Sundays too. Because of the mild color it matches everthing. And unlike lip gloss, it's not sticky at all. (I can't tolerate any stickiness!) I am only somewhat picky about scent and taste, and to me this one has neither. I think it is by far worth the $20!!	pos
Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry	neg
I loved the book and I feel that this movie did it justice.  The actresses are new favorites of mine, and I feel they really captured the spirit of the characters.  The movie really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th century England just as the book does.  I would definately recommend this movie and the book.	pos
Of course, no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that Dizzy could.  His trumpet can only be described as HOT, and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air.   This man's music has LIFE in it. Unfortunately, the REAL energy to Dizzy is in his Latin Jazz work, and a more complete compilation of that style would be the Compact Jazz series. Ken Burns' collection here is more versatile, but just not as lively as Dizzy's music can be.  Proceed with caution	pos

My boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot. I also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women. For example, there are fresh articles about fashion, cars, gadgets, sex and even celebrities. I read them with interest and skip the models, which I guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys. Well, that's fine. I am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend doesn't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. That's why I don't mind when he lists Maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women. Maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble. Overall, it is a very good, high quality magazine, which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information, and I am sure that you will enjoy each issue.	pos
I was given this as a gift and I was very excited to use it out and about.  But when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off.

This is perfect for the desktop.  It excels at destroying credit cards, DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc.  In an emergency you can use it to shred paper, including staples. ---  --- Because DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc are dense, they lay flat, and take up very little room in the debris basket.  Since paper is light, it will bunch up, filling the debris basket fast.  If you do a lot of paper, you want to consider a paper shredder with a larger basket. ---  --- Because it is shredding polycarbonate and metal, the feeder slot snuggly fits DVDs, CDs, and Floppy Discs.  This reduces the chance of high energy debris.  Do Not look into the slot while shredding.  Because of the snug slot, feeding paper into the MD100 is not quick.  If you want to shred less than 8 pages, but cannot leave your desk, you can use the MD100.  If you want to shred more than 8 pages, or can leave you desk, it is better to use a paper shredder with a larger feed slot and a larger basket. ---  --- This is also a personal shredder, if you need to shred from more than two minutes at a time (approximately 24 DVDs or CDs or Floppy Discs), you should get a commercial grade machine	pos
These have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now, both in New York & California.

I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  I have a similar one that is bigger, that I bought while in Charleston, SC.  She fell in love with mine, and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question, I decided on this one.  At first, when it arrived, I thought it would be too small, but my sister does not wear large neclaces, earrings, etc... Turns out she loved it.  It was just perfect for her, especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive	pos
The Sling Support feature on these underwear is practically useless. My testicles always slip completely out of the sling before I've had them on for even an hour. If these briefs enhance a man's "profile" at all, it's because they're so darn tight; it has nothing to do with the Sling Support. And talk about "low-rise"--the top of my crack is exposed even when they're pulled all the way up.  I'm in pretty good shape, but if these things shrink in the dryer, I won't be able to fit into them anymore. My advice: anybody ordering C-IN² briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear	neg

I really enjoy how they illustrate and break down their lessons into different playing abilities.  Even though they break down the lessons into breaking 80, 90, 100, straight hitter looking for power or power hitter looking for accuracy, they are all very helpful. No matter what your playing ability, I think any golfer can take away a little bit of advice from the playing lessons.   Unfortunately, Golf Magazine seems to be a little weak on their travel side lately though; not really focusing on that perhaps due to the downturn in travel in recent months.  I wish they would focus on that a little more like some other magazines such as T&L golf or The Golfer	neg

I'm not sure if the drills in this video are really championship calibre.  However, most of the drills that I used with my team were effective.  This video is for the first or second year Junior High coach (like myself) or any coach on the recreational level (ie. CYO and/or PAL coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter).  They are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough. The narrator uses the expression "dual purpose" drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill.  Combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills.  For instance, a drill with 3 players, one shooter, one rebounder and one passer.  A simple drill but after the shooter shoots, he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot.  The timing is such that when he gets back to his spot, the passer is already passing the ball.  Thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when I tried it, it worked great!  Other drills also worked well like "shots across the lane" and a few of the rebounding drills.  The explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the X's and 0's.  Added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video.  The drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long.  The sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach.  The video could have been more detailed with more theory (which I like), but in truth, it gives you just what it says.  Some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy	pos
My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.

I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.	neg

This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud! ---  --- This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book	neg
I'm a big Koontz fan and as is generally the case, I greatly enjoyed this story.  It was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre.  That said, it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book.  It had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of Koontz's other books.  In addition, the ending seemed a little hasty.  Thus I gave it four rather than five stars.  That said, I would gladly recommend it to a friend as I would most any of this author's work	pos

Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable. ---  --- Main characters: ---  --- Squall- A member of SeeD, he is a jerk to everybody. ---  --- Zell-A member of SeeD, he is a surfer dude and a dunce. ---  --- Quistis-A teacher and a member of SeeD, she seems to like Squall...for one reason or another... ---  --- Seifer- Squall's rival, he is even worse then Squall. ---  --- Rinoa- A member of 'The owls',Square soft ran out of ideas, she is just like Aeris. ---  --- Selphie- A member of SeeD, she is a weird character and I was sad to see her in Kingdom hearts. ---  --- Laguna- A Galbadian soldier. He is the best charecter in the game. ---  --- Irvine-A member of SeeD, he is a lady's man and is recycled later in Final Fantasy IX as a better charecter known as Zidane. ---  --- This game is the second worst Final Fantasy game ever made. The story is great, but playing it is so bad that its almost unbelivable. If Square soft remade this game for the PS2 or PSP, I would buy it, but only if they removed the draw system	neg

Just look at some of the virtues touted by the producers of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs: ---  --- --Great For Eating With Cheese  --- --Great For Fruit Salad And Also Makes A Great Snack For Kids  --- --"High in Vitamin A, C & Calcium"  ---  --- You can't help sitting back and staring in awe at California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs for it's utility and virtues.  On top of all that, they're SEEDLESS!!!!  Praised by greek philosophers for their healing powers, grapes are loved universally by both Democrats and Republicans...yes, a bipartisan fruit needed so badly in a time of partisan divisiveness, congressional sex scandals and unpopular wars.  Grapes bridge the divide between states, both red and blue.  No one can deny the power and tastiness of California Red Seedless Grapes, 1 lbs	pos

My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships.  This one is fully assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy.  The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate.  The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures.  My son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied for hours.  The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including the sails.  I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles.  I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects	pos

I first stumbled across this movie on cable in the late 80's. I loved it then and still do today. Great story, great casting, great acting & great period film making. Diane Lane is not to shabby either as a strippin' diva with a taste for the fast life. Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this "Gem Club" of a movie. I sincerely hope we'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on DVD. Heck, I'd love to have a DVD with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it's not. I can always dream though..	pos
I have not used this product for very long, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase another brand besides Adobe who seem to dominate in this softward category, but I have, so far, been plaesantly surprised with the performance & features.

I just wasted $16.35 on this piece of junk.  It arrived quickly, and became unusable even faster. ---  --- For those of you used to disposable screen covers, there is only one in this package!

If you are going to get a manual pump, get this one. I got a Medela from the hospital and it was SOOO slow and killed my hand, but this one is way better. It takes 5-10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the Medela, and it doesn't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals, and because you use it for less time total. I have never used an electric pump so I can't compare it to one of those, but as far as manuals go this one is AWESOME	pos

The best thing about this book is its table of contents. In second place is the preface. And then it's all downhill. If you want to buy a list of topics in electronic communications, with brief summaries that explain absolutely nothing whatsover in any great (or even little) detail, and you really have no other use for your hard earned $100.00+ dollars, then please go ahead and buy this book. ---  --- If however, you value your cash, and would rather buy a book that rather than insulting your intelligence, at least attempts in good faith to teach you something, then please, don't fall for the marketing ploy of the title "RF Microelectronics". Because there's very little "RF" and even less "Microelctronics" in this text. Here's a taste of the marketing ploy from the very first line of the preface: ---  --- "The annual worldwide sales of cellular phones has exceeded $2.5B." ---  --- Do I see dollar signs in your eyes? I thought so. Don't fall for the trap. If you want to learn a thing or two about RF electronics theory as well as detailed explanations of what the job of each individual component (like a capacitor here or a resistor there) in a communication circuit is, then buy: ---  --- Modern Electronic Communication (9th Edition) by Gary M. Miller. ---  --- The Miller book's 9th edition is coming out soon. Even with 992 pages of text, it costs only $60.00. ---  --- I believe Razavi's book should never have been published because frankly, it's not a book at all. Why it's still in print (though stuck at first edition for nearly 10 years), is completely beyond any sane person's comprehension	neg

I am finding this book quite helpful to getting to know myself better and to have greater control over my emotional responses, or mood. The authors guide you through several approaches of specific steps you should take to get to know some of your core beliefs, which they say may be causing depression. You are free to choose the approach that works best for you, but you do need to try them all to see what works. It is quite time consuming. One of the approaches requires you to record your activities and asses your mood every hour. The instructions are clear and concice and examples provided are helpful, however it does take a true commitment. I suppose it may be fair to say that true change most often does take real work	pos

I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business.  I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me. ---  --- I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - "Simple Start".  I received it just fine and it installed perfectly. ---  --- However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files.  As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing. ---  --- So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80.  QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels.  The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time.	pos
This model has all the features of the Elite 9500 (2 brush heads, 2 cleaning modes, programmable quadpacer, and a guage to indicate about how much charge is remaining in the battery), but it's $12 cheaper from Amazon! ---  --- All the "programmable quadpacer" feature amounts to is the ability to leave it on for an extra (i.e., a fifth) 30-second interval, or the ability to turn the timer off so that it's just on/off.  I regard most of the features as functional ornamentation ("bells and whistles"), but the Elite 9800 also happens to be a dependable, super-lightweight model that will run a good three weeks on a charge with only one person using it.  I went on a three-week trip and didn't bother to pack my charger, and it had charge to spare when I got back.  NOTE: I always allow the NiCd battery run all the way down (to exhaustion) before charging it, and that enhances both the charge and battery life.  (NiCd's only have so many charge cycles.) ---  --- If this is your first electric, you might like the way it comes out of the box programmed to gradually ramp-up the power over the first fourteen brushings. ---  --- What's the difference between the 9800 and the 9500?  The models appear identical.  The only difference I found is that one comes in a box that says 9800, the other says 9500.  :-)  	pos

We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit?

I am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie. It is merely a monument to Hollywood's stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale. In Dumas's book the Count learns that he cannot play God--dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good--because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life. He abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful God. ---  --- Hollywood gives us instead: Triumphant Revenge.	neg
If you like fantasy and are not acquainted with the works of Andre Norton, then this is an excellent starting point.  Believable, heroic characters and a well thought-out "Witch World" combine to make for an enjoyable read.  Simon Tregarth is transported through a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other things not people.  A struggle goes on between good and evil, and it's not clear who is winning.  (But, we know who wins in the end - "good", of course.)  The style of writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one strength that characterizes her writings.  That, and the fascinating settings, imaginative perils faced, and strong likable characters make this a "must read".  This is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story.  It does not suffer from the typical overinflated, overwordy, overcomplicated, and overcharacterized (and lifeless) features of the usual fantasy megathon offered today	pos
The Edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge, is easy to install, as well as use. I would love to have given it 5 stars (it deserves them), but one thing that does not work correctly, and really bugs me is the calories expended. It couldn't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way. The first day that I installed it, I took it for a quick 1 mile test ride. IT indicated that in that mile I burned 100+ calories. Wish it were true, but it is not. Unfortunetly the next day I was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride, but crashed as I started out and have not riden since (3 days). I wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further. After 2 hours it read 0 were burned. I just took it for a car ride of 7 miles. In those 7 miles DRIVEN IN A CAR, it indicates I burned nearly 600 calories, again I wish, but no way. ---  --- Other than that flaw, whioh I hope they fix with a software update, I highly recommend this product, it all other ways it is great	pos

Although everything is shown in silhouette, there is plenty of color and action and my kids (boy and girl; now 3 and 5) have always like it.  There are herds of elephants, steaming machines, flowers, critters and more.   ---  --- As the first spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment of critters and things that one can find I won't say more. ---  --- But in regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they didn't like them.   But I think they miss the point.  The book is about *shapes* and how much you *can* identify without the `advantage' of a detailed picture.  And looking at the silhouette and identifying the item/creature is part and parcel of the mental exercise, just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story.  If you used pictures you'd hardly learn anything about `shapes' would you. ---  --- No, the use of shadows is just right for exercising young minds.  For reaching for that Aristotelian abstract (LOL) of what is `skunk'.   And it is amazing how even the littlest of people can tell a skunk from a cat even with Seuss' odd artwork. ---  --- Five Stars.  19 pages of fun for boys and girls.  This sturdy boardbook is a good read-aloud that stretches the imagination	pos
The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths. ---  ---  Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL	neg
I purchase this on Amazon for $499 no tax & free shipping. You can not match this quality at this price. The HD with HDMI cable using Comcast digital box is outstanding. The sound is also better with the HDMI vs componet cables. The jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode.

I bought this toy for my four year old for Christmas thinking it would be the perfect toy for her since she loves Care Bears and she loves the game hide and seek. This toy was a big disappointment! She was so excited when she opened the package but when we tried to play with it, she got frustrated and lost intrest very quickly. The Care Bear "finder" does not give good clues to where the Care Bear is hiding and makes it very confusing for a child. It was saying "come find me" even when she was within a couple feet of it and she had to be right on top of it before it would tell her that she's "getting warmer." It doesn't let the child know that they are getting close to it until they can see it. My daughter gave up on it quickly because she would be wandering the house aimlessly without any clue as to it's where abouts. I do not recommend this toy to any one. I would have given it no stars, but she does like the bear itself. Do yourself a favor...buy a care bear (much cheaper), hide it somewhere, and you can truthfully tell your child when they are "getting warmer!	neg
Besides Baldur's Gate II, Icewide Dale is the second most fun CRPG game out there.  More action than role playing, which is fine with me. ---  --- This is a single-player multi-character game, and you get to create the entire party of 6 adventures.  The plot is fairly weak, but the action is plentiful and I love the fact that you get to develop 6 different characters.  If you have to get just one of the Icewind Dale games, get Icewind Dale II.  The character generation and development is much better (not to mention the gameplay and graphics)	pos

AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song. ---  --- AFI is looking to appeal to the mainstream. There's nothing wrong with that, if you keep your old sound, which this band has failed to do. This, my friends, is AFI's worst album, if not hte worst album of 2006. ---  --- Check out the older AFI stuff. "Sing The Sorrow" is okay, but if you want truley good music, you have to go back into their ninties albums	neg
These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene.

I am particular about paper cutters/ trimmers. I have used many over the years. This is like the traditional guillotine cutter but with a laser light to guide you as to where you should be cutting the paper or photo. This gives a very clean cut. No burred edges, no paper getting caught, straight line exactly where you want it. I do not recommend the small personal paper cutters with fixed blades that push/pull. I also don't recommend rotary blade cutters. Both of these type of cutters get blunt quickly and are quite frustrating. They are also difficult to line up exactly where you want to cut. They purport to cut through a few layers of paper, but this is simply not the case. I find it difficult even using one page in these cutters. After not very much use - such as one or two batches of whole page photos, they quickly give you burred edges and the blades need replacing often. They tell you the grips are large and easy to use, which is definitely not the case. I find the grip of this particular trimmer to be much more comfortable and user-friendly. I also really love the laser guidance. I highly recommend this product to any person that uses it for home office or personal use.	pos

When I got a new computer at the end of 2001, the 2002 edition was installed on my computer by Gateway. Although I never used Streets and Trips (and barely used Encarta), I used Word and Picture It! quite heavily. ---  --- Well, my hard drive died a few weeks ago, and I had to get a new computer. I bought Microsoft Works Suite 2006 to go with it.  ---  --- I was a bit apprehensive because Picture It! was replaced with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 Editor. It took me a while to get fluent in Picture It!, and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting. (I write mostly for the web, and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles--as well as for eBooks.) ---  --- I haven't done any extensive work with it yet, but it appears easy to use IF you have experience with Picture It! If you've never used any image program before, it may be a bit confusing. (I feel that Picture It! was more self-explanatory.) ---  --- However, for all that the Works Suite gives you, I feel it's a good buy. Word 2002 has advantages over the older version (for example, you can easily insert images), and Encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework (or curious adults wanting to learn more about something). ---  --- Updating Encarta is easy as clicking a mouse: just open up the program and click "Update Encarta". New articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer.  ---  --- Although I *still* don't use Streets and Trips (I go to MapQuest reflexively), I still think this is a great Suite for a great price	pos

I am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try.  I have a six-year old Hitachi DVD player, and I lost the remote.  I couldn't play anything without it, because the buttons on the player don't allow me to select any tracks.  The instructions on this remote are incredibly easy.  It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default.  When I had to locate a code for my DVD player, I got worried-- none of the 3 Hitachi DVD codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process.  But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip's library till one works.  It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.  I think I'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms	pos
I love Dancehall Queen!  I lost my first copy (VHS) so I replaced it with a new copy in DVD.

I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.

All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable	neg
It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named "ilegally" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac.  Run Mac owners... Ru	neg
This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.

I got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day, for several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the song list. he is able to use it independently, except for pushing the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in a very long time. well worth the money.	pos
I have used this book for more than 5 years and take it with me on every trip to Paris. If you can't get success from these recipes then you might consider some other past time than baking. Get used to baking with weights and this book is perfect. Something as simple as a Madeleinne is created perfectly in weight measures but just a shot in the dark when using volume measurments. This book is not exactly for beginner bakers but if you have some experience it is fantasti	pos
I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service. ---  --- The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer.  Also included is "PowerChute Personal Edition" software.  This software replaces the UPS option used under the "Power" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel.  PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs.  PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar.  It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference. ---  --- In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets.  Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the "surge only" outlet row. ---  --- When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load.  It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly .  The default method it uses is to place the PC into "hibernation mode", saving the desktop exactly "as is" for future start-up.  It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly. ---  --- If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased.  However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks.	pos
My only experience with this product was after I opened it, and started to play a DVD in my Xbox, when I tried to pause it, it didn't work, and it had brand new batteries. I found (after much frustration) that if I smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes. I took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit, but it was sold out so I just got my money back. You can buy a DVD player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	neg

Fly Through Spanish is some of the best software for the Fly pen available.  You can write a word in English and hear the Spanish translation, or write a Spanish word and hear the English translation.  The translator will also spell out translations for you (my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly, especially if you're trying to write them down).  The cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn Spanish words.  Fly Through Spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play.  I was very impressed with the verb charts.  They actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs.  Fly Through Spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing Spanish words.  Please keep in mind that this software will not teach you Spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self-study program. ---  --- I hope that Leapfrog releases more languages, especially French	pos

My husband and I adore this monitor.  It picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great.  We occasionally get some interference, but all I have to do is move the monitor and it goes away.  The interference never occurs on the unit in my baby's room, just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up.  I love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house.  I plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long!  You can defintely trust this monitor	pos
I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on.

When my son was born in May I tried the Dr Brown's bottles based on a co-worker's recommendation, and I am so glad I did!  My kids are all primarily breastfed, but for times when I need a bottle, Dr. Brown's are now the only ones I will use. My son is almost 4 months old now, and has had very little gas, and has never had any problems with colic! I wish I had had these bottles when my other children were babies. ---  --- As for those whining about the extra parts to clean.. Puh-leeze! I hand-wash all my baby's bottles anyway, but did you know these bottles also include an extra thin bottle brush to clean the straws with?? Dr. Brown's makes it as easy on the parents as possible, but who doesn't take the extra time to make sure their baby has the best? With the little brush to use on the straw and vents, it really takes no time at all, so stop the nonsense. Anyone who is even halfway considering trying these bottles really should pick up ONE at least, but I know you will go out and get more if you do	pos

I just received this game yesterday and I've already put a few hours worth of time into it.  You can't help but notice the Rockstar trademark graphics and intro.  Although the controls and character movements I think have improved over the  San Andreas controls and movement.   ---  --- I found it challenging to balance the time in this game.  The clock moves pretty fast, and you have to run around finding challenges as well as watching the clock to make sure you aren't truant from class or trespassing at night when you're supposed to be in bed!  You also have to really watch out for the Prefects, which by the way, is the same term used in Harry Potter.  Maybe it's a British thing?   ---  --- I have to disagree with the one reviewer saying that Jimmy is not a Bully.  He isn't like the other bullies, but he does have to win the respect of others (GTA style) by protecting and beating up the Bullies.  So basically Jimmy bullies the bullies.   ---  --- Breaking into lockers, running errands for the underpriveleged, flirting with girls, getting good grades in class, riding around on a skateboard, and one of my favorites is Dodgeball in Gym Class!  And these are all things I've come across in the first few hours of play!  What's next?   ---  --- Get this game!  It's a vast array of ecleptic gaming skills and entertainment styles, you won't regret it!  ---  --- And if you are also looking for a completely original game, graphics like I've never seen before I noticed alot of Bully buyers get Okami, which I did also, and that is like no other game graphics-wise.  VERY artistic for those who's girlfriends get tired of watching you play the same ol.  It is pleasing to the eye.  Very artistic and original.  	pos
I bought this band in two strengths. It is advertised as "99.998% free of soluble proteins and latex allergens" and powder free and it is neither. I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only .02 % latex. ---  --- Customer service was helpful when I called.	neg
I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:   ---  --- 1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.   ---  --- 2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music. ---  --- 3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this "feature". ---  --- It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires. ---  --- BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it. --- 	pos

I'm on page 110 of this book. The book has 220 pages. I'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person I am angry with. I bought this book because I have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. But, it is having the opposite affect. I feel I was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). Part 1 tells us what a "grievance" is. It tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. The thing is  I ALREADY KNOW what a grievance is! I KNOW I'm angry at someone, and I know it's not healthy, I know to forgive would help me.... I didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. All that reading did was make me dwell and think MORE about the problem AND increased my anger because of the book itself. When I reached "Part 2", entitles "Forgiveness" I thought FINALLY.... but all Part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. There are some great reviews of this book here at Amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. But so far I can't agree with any of the positive comments. I have a great degree of respect for Stanford University, I went to high school across the street from Stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. Is it fair of me to write a review of a book I have not finished? No... but I'm afraid to continue reading it. I'm already angry and to buy a book that I thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, I don't feel is not all that fair either......	neg
This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.

On any list of pure English-language business reportage, BARRON'S would figure in the top ten. This newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication. ---  --- Though 'fluff' is not a word commonly associated with the Wall Street Journal, think of BARRON'S as 'WSJ without the fluff'.  That's how focused it is. ---  --- Electronic availability of business numbers has pushed BARRON'S off the 'must read' list, though it has its guild of old faithful readers who consider nothing else its equal.

I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review.  I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer.  After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side.  What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings?  I will return the unit. ---  --- Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious	neg

The pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell -- what are these "packaging engineers" thinking? It took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it, and then I took the scissors to it, and the hard packaging almost broke them! ---  --- But I was thrilled.  A handsome object, thought I, and I loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open.  So much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband.  I yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed.  But, alas, it would not follow instructions as they were written.  "Press and hold the Set button.  Hour display blinking."  (Could they not have said, "The hour display will blink"?  I pressed.  "Press Memory button to adjust the hour."  I did.  The Memory button never did a thing.  So I asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either.  We both tried several combinations of maneuvers, but nothing worked.  To this moment, the hour display is blinking, blinking, blinking. ---  --- I'd like to get my money back, but ya know what?  J & R Music & Computer World in NY demand such a rigamarole to send it back, including with all the original packaging (I threw the OP in the trash), that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions, which, of course, are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves.  Now I'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash, while I will make sure I never order from J&R again.    	neg

I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	neg

Immediately upon starting Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend," I was struck by parallels with Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo."  Both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice.  The Count deals with the darker theme of revenge.  Our Mutual Friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth. ---  --- The novel is lively throughout, as  Dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents.  The tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and antisemitism, to delicate romance, to witty visual humor.  The characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies. ---  --- Most impressive to me was the consistency of Dickens' plot.  Our Mutual Friend was written and published in installments, as was The Count of Monte Cristo.  But Dickens keeps his story on track throughout, never dropping a character, while Dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies	pos
Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl.

The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking. ---  --- I do have a couple of nits, though. My original DVD changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc I wanted. With this one, I have to press a Disc Skip button to cycle through all the discs until I reach the one I want. The front of the player does have direct access buttons, though. I wish I still had my old remote control as I'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality. ---  --- Second, the upscaling through HDMI produces a great image, but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. In fact, upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. It's also unfortunate that while connected through HDMI, progressive scan cannot be turned off. This shouldn't be an issue most of the time, but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. Progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote, but they cannot be turned off when connected through HDMI.  ---  --- One last thing about the HDMI connection. There can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using HDMI connections and digital TVs. This is not a problem with the player, but with the way HDMI is currently implemented. This player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. However, the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. Since I need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound, the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. And that's a shame. By the way, there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component, s-video, or composite outputs. ---  --- There's also a minor thing I've found about all my Sony DVD players that I haven't liked. They are unable to correctly display Time Remaining on certain discs, or more commonly on the special features (documentaries, etc.) on certain discs. I also have a cheapo Philips player which has no problems displaying Time Remaining on those things (even on the menu). It's an improvement I'd really like to see implemented on future players. ---  --- Now, despite the complaints I've listed above, don't get me wrong. This is still an excellent player and I really love it. I happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. It really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances, and I feel it's the best DVD player I've ever owned. It's just not quite perfect. In all likelihood, it's also the last DVD player I'll ever own as I'll probably be buying a BluRay or other HD player in a couple of years when that format war is over. But this is a great player to hold me over until then	pos
I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems).

I have this program on a 30-day demo.  It might be OK if I didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable. ---  --- I tried to run the system virus scan, as recommended, but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it couldn't seem to get past.  I skipped the file, but then it quickly got stuck again.  The "time remaining" said it would take 4 days to complete, so I cancelled that scan. ---  --- It has a learning mode that initally blocks EVERYTHING.  Apparently, this program has no brain.  For example, I have the Live Search Toolbar installed in Outlook.  It had to ask me if it was OK to run that dll file.  In fact, each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run. ---  --- Don't even get me started on the Quickbooks and Internet Explorer problems.  Which is what it wouldn't let those programs do, even after they had been run and I repeated clicked "allow" over and over. ---  --- Twice today it got so slow running IE that it finally crashed the computer so bad that  I had to do a hard re-boot.  If you have it checking ports on your computer, almost nothing would run or download on IE. ---  --- So, I'm going to demo a few more, but it's probably back to Windows Live OneCare, which I had the past year.  It just doesn't seem to do much (no long list of features), but it also doesn't jam everthing else up	neg
"You get what you pay for" ---  --- Most of the time that cliche is true, but there are products out there that break this rule.  The Philips DVP642 is one of them, a great quality, versatile product selling at a bargain price.  This is not. ---  --- I was hoping the same of this product from all the "glowing" reviews on here.  However, this quality of this monopod is very disappointing.  First of all, you have to ask yourself, why do you need a monopod over a tripod?  For myself and most, it's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses.    However, telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task.  This monopod doesn't even come close. ---  --- Here are it's bad points: ---  --- -The aluminum construction is very cheap quality.  The leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them.  It feels like thin, cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time. ---  --- -The head is very cheap and not solid.  No matter how tight I tightened the head, my camera would slope down.  The workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point, you think that you're going to break the PLASTIC tightening screw if you tighten it too much.  I think we've all experienced that in the past. ---  --- -The leg locks are not tight.  When you push down on the monopod, the leg segments slide back into themselves. ---  --- In the end, it was a risk I took hoping that I could get a high-quality product for a cheap price.  Sometimes, you can get away with that.  Walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30.  In this case, I should've bought a REAL monopod.  Oh well, I wasted $16 that I could've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod	neg
    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones. ---  ---     The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing. ---  ---    I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together.  ---  ---    Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed.

It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement. 	pos
Sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process. This case is very slim, compact, well made, and has a very luxurious feel to it. It completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the Sony camera it is designed to hold	pos
I agree with other reviewers that the graphics and vocals are good, but I find the gameplay itself less than stellar. For starters, I've always been irritated with games that don't let you save your status whenever you want. Sometimes I just want to get in a quick dose of gameplay, but that's not possible with these games that require you to play through an entire section before being allowed to save.  That contributes to the repetitive, tedious nature of some sections. If you get stuck getting through a certain bit of the game, you're doomed to replay much of what led up to it over and over again. ---  --- I realize that tricky camera angles are some of the challenges that are supposed to exist in this game. More than in the earlier versions, however, I have trouble getting myself lined up for whatever task. Another tedious element. ---  --- I found this game to be more a test of my endurance and patience than actual fun	neg
These strawberries are great.  They are great on cereal.  The price is fantastic.  My kids had some freeze dried berries at a "space center" but they were much more expensive.  These are a steal.  I am so happy to know where to get great freeze dried berries at a great price. 	pos
I saw this bread in my local health food store, and it looked so good I decided to try it.  I must say it taste just as good as it looks. This is by far the besting tasting cracker I've ever tasted.   ---  --- Made completely from certified organic ingrediants, this product is an excellent choice for the health conscious. And the price here at Amazon is a great buy in comparison to any local retailer. ---  --- I'm looking forward to this replacing the breads I usually use	pos

If you're the type of person that doesn't spend HOURS on the phone, and want a good basic phone, this phone is for you. I bought this phone in the UK at the Carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks, and it works great. I would say that the only gripe about this phone in the US is the price, I wouldn't pay over 40 bucks for it. It's a nice BASIC phone. The screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones.	pos
I have found another product that I want to recommend. It's called Alert and is sold by consultants like Avon, but you can also go the Starlight website and order it. It's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters, and as a bonus I don't feel hungry when I'm using it. They also have a product specifically for weight loss. I have tried that as well. I did feel a bit jittery at first... but it settled after a week or so of taking it. I would recommend it also. I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs. I did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss, but I credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings. --- I'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control and it's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now use it. I've used this for years and have not had any problems.	neg
I've owned and discarded numerous chargers.  This one is great - the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use.  It looks pretty fragile, but so far it's held up to pretty heavy use.  Many of the other chargers I've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection - no such problems with this one	pos
If a book makes me look forward to mid-life - I am all over it! This book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find!  Here, Harvard researcher and bestselling author, Joan Borysenko, takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I find myself constantly at odds with the "beauty" images that the media gives us.  I mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society?   ---  --- Perhaps it's escapism - I tell myself (in effort to sleep at night).  Yet, after reading Borsyenko's, book I'm reminded that, yes, it's good to follow intellectual pursuits. And, yes, there's differences between women and men.  According to Borysenko, women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society, family, and how to make a difference in the world.  Men tend to define themselves by their work.  Most telling!  Anyhow, I won't give away the store here - but in my opinion, if you are of the female persuasion, you will not want to miss this read.  	pos
This game is in such a sorry state that I don't even know where to begin. ---  --- First of all, this is not at all what I expected and what I wanted. Sid is known for very complex simulations and I preordered this game only because I saw his name as the game designer. Alas, the game is the most dumbed down train simulation I had ever seen. Looks like Sid jumped in the "easy, fast and easy" bandwagon. ---  --- Second, the game is, at best, barely out of beta - a little more useful and less destructive than, say, a computer virus. I experience frequent crashes and the AI often builds ridiculous tracks. ---  --- Finally, be aware that the game has one of the worst copy protection systems I had ever seen, which interferes with other applications. For instance, the game won't launch while I run Skype. ---  --- Selling a game in such an unfinished state shows lack of ethics and disrespect for the customer. Shame on you, Firaxis and Sid Meier.	neg

I must write quickly, for soon, soon, the Milk will awake within me again.  And it will know, but you will have been warned.  The Milk will punish me, but it knows it must have a host, so I will survive - tormented and trapped within myself, but I will continue to exist, though I live in nightmare now. ---  --- Beware!  Beware the Milk!  For the Milk lives.  I too was once tempted by the smooth, sweet creaminess of Tuscan Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 Fl Oz.  I too read the odes written to its greatness, not knowing that the Milk was forcing it's hosts to speak of the goodness of the Milk that the Milk might spread, that it might acquire new hosts in which to live, and to spread, to spread, to spread. ---  --- Beware the sweet seduction of the Milk!  Ah - the bittersweet memories of that first gallon.  How smooth, how creamy, how exhilarating, uplifting, fulfilling and enlightening!  How free it made me feel!  But then came that terrible moment when in my home town supermarket, I reached for a gallon of store brand milk, and felt the pain.  Oh, the pain the Milk can give!  Equal in intensity to the first joy that the Milk can give, but pain!  Terrible pain!  Words alone cannot describe it! ---  --- And now, I live in fear of the Milk, a Slave to the joy and the pain it can give.  Oh, the shame I feel that I must come to the Milk like a supplicant, begging for the pleasure it can give.  And the cowardice that I feel, knowing that I cannot face the pain it can inflict. ---  --- Beware!  Do not let this be your fate! ---  --- And now, I must go... the Milk stirs inside me, and it will be angry.  But perhaps, perhaps, it is not too late for you...	neg

Be forewarned those who may be driving in the desert at night on some dark, deserted piece of highway. Stop for hitchhikers at your own risk. Also avoid the urge of trying to be too helpful to fellow motorist stranded along the way. Remember things are not always what they appear to be. ---   --- This was quite a well-constructed, coherent storyline from beginning to end. You are never left in the dark with this plot. Everything is explained at the appropriate time, the history of this particular vampire sect, how they happened to show up in Midwest America, how the vampire virius works in the body, its telepathic properties and what must be done to cure yourself from the curse of "The Forsaken." All this infomation was nicely worked into the script in such a way as not to bog down the viewer with too much substance, hence detracting from what the average movie fan is looking for, gore and violence. ---  --- A brief comment for any young girls who may get struck watching this with a boyfriend. While you may not enjoy the horror elements in the movie you might enjoy the male members of the cast which includes; Brendan Fehr (Roswell), Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek, Final Destination) and Johnathon Schaech (That Thing You Do) as the head vampire. ---  --- Brendan Fehr was terrific as the young, wise beyond his years vampire hunter roaming the highways and byways in search of the vampire that infected him with the virius. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nick (Brendan Fehr) and Sean (Kerr Smith) stop at a roadside diner for a bite to eat. A two-way conversation quickly turns into a monologue when Nick begins to compare the aspirations and hopes of his generation with those of the last. It's not only hilarious, but absolutely true. Without giving away too much of the ending, I'll just say a perfect opening was provided for a sequel. While I'm not generally a fan of sequels, I would've liked to see Brendan Fehr reprise his role of vampire hunter at least one more time. ---  --- Simply the most enjoyable vampire film since "The Lost Boys."	pos

The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him.  It's the only scene that made me laugh. ---  --- The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie. ---  --- The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch.  His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch.  The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad.  She doesn't love him.  She doesn't need him at all.  She's done with him. ---  --- The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb.  That doesn't happen.  If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you.  Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny. ---  --- The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids.  The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done.  Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on.  Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day. ---  --- To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying.  The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on.  But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something.  It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family	neg
I just bought this on CD as it was on sale through the CD club.  I have the original vinyl, but hadn't listened to it in years.   ---  --- This is one of the best works of music ever conceived, written and performed.  It is absolutely timeless and each song impresses you more than the last.  Put this one on repeat and let it play three or four times. It just keeps getting better. ---  --- Stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best.  Don't forget how great music was in the 70's.  This work is one of the major reasons for the resurgence of 70's music today by artists that weren't even born then.  You can see quite clearly the artists that followed Stevie.  Most recently Alicia Keys who would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration	pos
I have NEVER smelled any cologne as good as this. Unforgivable is absolutely wonderful! I saw diddy on several talk shows promoting this fragrance and thought here we go... another famous person in the perfume industry - not gonna be any good. So I go shopping the other day and see a tester bottle. I had to try it. sprayed it on the little piece of paper and immediately asked the sales clerk to give me the biggest bottle they had. It is amazing. My boyfriend comes home from work, I present him with the cologne and he wasn't thrilled (not into colognes and such), but promises to try it anyway. He didn't hate it!!! And that's about as thrilled as he gets about anything, so I knew then it was a good thing. I just can't quit smelling him, his clothes, his car - everything smells Unforgivable! We went out with some friends for dinner and drinks and both of my girlfriends pulled me aside to ask what cologne he was wearing - they wanted to buy it for their guys too! Now I can't wait for the women's fragrance to come out... SeanJean DEFINITELY has a winner here	pos

First off i just want to say that i've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline. ---  --- I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games	neg
I use this 1GB card in my Sony Playstation Portable, and it is awesome!  The tranfer rate using the USB 2.0 cable to the PSP is very good, and I love having all that storage space for movies, music, and images.  I got the Ultra II because I had read that Sandisk outperformed Sony in speed tests, and I have to agree.  The tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32MB Sony card that came with the PSP.  For an extra $5-$10 I got the Ultra II that has a warranty and better performance.  I think it is well worth it	pos
The Wolf Man Legacy set a no brainer.Like all the classic Universal Legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone. Jack Pierce's Make up and Wolfman Creation are still the best!

This book is poorly written and even more poorly edited. The back cover states ... "every subject is given background and basic exercises to allow beginners to figure it out." It is a great statement, but it is unfortunately not true. ---  --- Page 6: "So what formats can a script be saved as? There are three main kinds of script files: regular compiled script, which is the native AppleScript file format, and scripts saved as plain text or as applications. On top of that, OS X added a new option for saving compiled scripts and script applications called "bundle." Bundles are folders that appear and behave as files. You can read about them in Chapter 23." - I guess bundle is not a "main" format? Why is there a distinction between main formats and, for lack of a better term, minor formats? I have no idea.  ---  --- Page 35: "Every class has a super class." --- Page 40: "We saw that objects belong to classes, and classes may have subclasses and super classes." - Which sentence is correct? ---  --- Page 43: "When you work with an application that doesn't support the whose clause, you have to settle for slower, clumsier repeat loops." - Repeat loops are not explained earlier in the book. There is no reference on this page to the repeat loops that are explained extensively in Chapter 11, pages 321-343. ---  --- I wanted to like this book, but I do not. I look forward to a revised first edition or new second edition of this book, because it does have potential to be great. However the next edition needs more polished writing and meticulous editing	neg

This movie will grow on you if you like the sweet romantic comedy.    ---  --- The cast is great.  Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) the Garage Mechanic falls in love at first sight of Catherine(Meg Ryan) when she appears at his Gas Station with a failing car with her  pretentious fiance James Mooreland (Stephen Fry).  Ed decides to go ask her out and appears at her home and knocks on the door.  The door opens and there is Albert Einstein(Walter Matthau) "You're Albert Einstien!"  "Zank you" and thus begins the plot to break up the engagment and bring Ed and Catherine together. ---  --- The subcharacters are great!  Especially Einstein's pals played by Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks, and Joseph Maher.   "Three of the greatest minds and together they can't change a light bulb." ---  --- All in all a great warm funny film!   Matthau again has to mentioned as his performance was brilliant.   He should have been nominated IMHO.   You can't go wrong with this one	pos

Grew up on this group. Love them then and love them now. Own the "Best of" Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album shares the message of all times. "Together We Stand" opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy Riley, and Aaron Hall.  I like the flavor the cameos add to this album. If you're into mid-tempo music this is the album to purchase	pos
My 9 month old loves this toy.  Before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls, he would roll it on the floor and    crawl after it. It keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it. Also, there are no loose parts or pieces to lose, which I appreciate.  Great toy	pos
Let me start by saying I think the regular Guru energy drink is the best on the market. I only wish I could say the same about GURU Lite. There is nothing positive about this drink. It is awful! I was very excited about trying the Lite version but after my first can the rest went straight into the garbage. You might as well take a Ginseng or Ginkgo Biloba capsule open it and pour it straight into your mouth. If you are big fan of the regular Guru stay with it and don't waste your money on their Lite version.	neg

This is the worst software I bought.  ---  --- First,it cost $100 and McAfee did not honor the $55 rebate because I sent the rebate form a little late. They had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form. Isn't that kind of trick?  ---  --- Second and most important, it slowed down everything, not a bit but by dozens of seconds  or even more than 1 minute.  ---  --- Third,the speed is not only the problem, its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines can't get online and can't connect to the network. I have 3 PCs and 1 laptop. Only two machine can get connected. It also conflicts with Belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years. How the hell McAfee did not know that adaptor? ---  --- Fourth, there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself. Given it has so much problem it's very frustrating to configure it. Sometimes the security center is downloading forever. Who the hell knows what it is doing. Sucks.  ---  --- I had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much. I changed back to Internet Security Suite which is much better than this. Don't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk.  --- 	neg
I bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends. I have had if for more than one year, and it has performed above expectations under all conditions. The 1 minute video feature is great, and was an unexpected bonus (since I didn't know about it when I bought it off Amazon).  ---  --- The camera works great with iPhoto and MacOS X. I bought a 512 MB card for it and so far it has been great. Both my father and my father in law have the previous Powershot S400 and they have had no problems with it. I figure at some point I'll have to change the battery, because Lithium-Ions lose 20% capacity per year, but so far it has worked flawlessly.	pos
Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period. ---  --- Before investing in this software, though, check carefully the specifications of your PC.  The faster the processor and the more RAM you have, the better the results.  The software will run on the minimum specification identified, but it may not run fast enough to satisfy the needs of some us. ---  --- This software is useful in many circumstances.  Many of us can speak faster than we can type and many of us compose as we type.  The software can be used with a range of eMail clients as well as in word processing and other software.   ---  --- You can, as it claims, obtain reasonable voice recognition results with a few minutes of set up and training.  But for optimal use, and the best return on investment, consider using the voice command capabilities to drive other software.  This takes more effort initially but can deliver significant benefits. ---  --- I'll be buying a new PC before I look at upgrading this software. ---  --- Highly recommended. ---  --- Jennifer Cameron-Smit	pos
I only wish I had read the previous review before I bought this item.  I too was trying to convert my Hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my Sony MiniDV handycam.  I bought this way-too-expensive cable, mostly because it was the only option available.  It seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card, considering the technology involved in those devices. ---  --- But my real problem is with the failure of Sony to reveal that the S-video connection is useless for input.  This information is nowhere on the package, nor is it on their website.  There IS a notice saying "please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase".  You can't read that warning when buying online, and if buying at a store, there's no way to know what's compatible because they don't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package. I guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website, then come back to the store and buy it, instead of just buying it and seeing if it works. ---  --- There is a section of the Handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one, however they fail to mention that the SONY cable won't work, despite the premium price they charge.  If the problem is that they couldn't make it work with both a composite and S-video cable, then they should have just made it work for S-video, since a composite cable comes with the camera. ---  --- Shame on you, Sony, for adding a little aggravation to my day, and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard.  It's enough to make me want to buy a Canon camcorder (I buy Canon digital cameras precisely because I don't want to submit to proprietary Sony standards like MemoryStick). ---  --- Rant over.	neg
At first, I thought the only reason why I wanted this CD was because Idina Menzel was on it.

I emphasize strategy. What you will not find are fancy graphics, studio sound, arcade action, cheats, or a killer strategy that will win every time. This game is wonderfully balanced with 17 nations (another in the works), 1100 units, 400 spells, 400 magic sites, 250 magic items, and much more. But the neat thing is that they give you what you need to play in YOUR style. Berserker, defensive, researcher, swarmer, sneak, diplomatic, whatever. Instead of feeling like you are learning the strategies that the developer had in mind for you to learn, you can actually develop your OWN tactics and surprises. There are people who have played it over a year and still come up with new things to try. (and yes, its one of those games which will ACTUALLY survive on your machine for a year	pos

As an author I find Oprah's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month.  "Divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act.  Everyone deserves intimacy-emotional and physical.  If a gay or bisexual man loves his wife, her happiness will be more important to him than his own.  Setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be, is the ultimate expression of love." Dennis J. Schleicher --- 	pos

Horrible. The gears ingage before the tape is even loaded. You have to force the tape into the moving gears and hold down the tape door as it does not latch to stay closed on it's own.

I first tried this when my Mum bought a bottle during her holiday in November. The weather was cold, wet & dark at home. When I sprayed some on my wrists I wasn't impressed. ---  --- Come June & sunny, hot & bright days, I found myself trying `Just Me' in the shops & buying a bottle (which I'm quickly making my way through). ---  --- Lighter & easier to wear then `Paris Hilton', I'm using it all the time. Scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp & tangy. It contrasts nicely with the floral notes, so neither individual note overpowers me. ---  --- Overall `Just Me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work, shopping or lunch. --- For evening and autumn/winter look elsewhere.	pos
I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail. ---  --- I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory. ---  --- I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord. ---  --- When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted. ---  --- I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.   ---  --- Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords	neg
After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song "My Only" from the "Good as it gets"  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song	neg
AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound. ---  ---  If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"  ---  ---  At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process. ---  ---  Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane	neg
The fastest way to KNOW your plastic baby wares are CLEAN!  I love these bags.  Note, I use two bags simultaneously in the microwave to knock out my cleaning faster, since there are limits to how many items you can put in each bag without warping. ---  --- You do need to get any smudgy or residue like material off the plastic item BEFORE steaming it for best results. ---  --- Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this product, it has been a lifesaver to me	pos

With the all star lineup this movie had, I would've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the Gov. of Lousiana. This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable. Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it	neg
Seriously: the sound is the worst I have encountered on any DVD release, a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on, it all adds up to my conclusion that the DVD version is transfered from a very, very bad analog copy. On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases.....	neg
It's Christmas Day, and believe me, the only thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of dissatisfaction I've had with the Thomas battery powered engines.  These trains derail constantly.  I think it is because all four wheels have power, and the front wheels have too much traction, so they are able to climb out of the grooves.  Took me all night to set up a really cool track, and they derail every 40 seconds or so.  Read: 3 year old yelling at train.  Thank goodness I also bought a Brio battery powered engine as well (the Polar Express one).  It works much better.  It has not derailed once all morning.  It also is better in the following ways: 1) It shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power, 2) it can go into freewheel mode when you want to use it without power, 3) it goes in reverse, 4) it makes train sounds, 5) the coupling to other cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and more likely to maintain the magnetic connection, 6) it comes with batteries installed.  If "Santa Claus" had not disposed of all the packaging last night, I would return all the battery operated Thomas Trains and go with Brio ones.  Note: there is a good thomas battery powered car which is the jet engine.  This jet engine has the swivel, and seems not to derail, maybe because it pushes the other cars in front of it	neg

I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business.  I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE.  It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was, it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected. After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people, nobody could help.  While it connected, it did work very well, it just did stay up.  Too Bad	neg

After seeing some of the other Amazon reviews of this movie, and the fact that Jason Swartzman was in it (after having seen him for the first time in "Rushmore" - a wonderful film), I had to purchase a copy of this DVD for myself to view.  It's got a wonderful cast of fine actors, but I found this movie really dumb.  One critic on the DVD box claimed this was "Laugh Out Loud Funny."  Really?  What movie was he watching?  I strained a chuckle here and there, but that was about it for me.  The Lily Tomlin & Dustin Hoffman characters were particularly annoying as was the script.  I know this was supposed to be a satiristic movie, but I didn't find much to snicker about. 	neg
Forget using this in a shed as the light is hardly bright enough to see your hand in front of your face.   ---  --- It doesn't hold a charge for longer than a few hours (the unit I received stayed on for about one hour and the box stated three hours).  This information was no where to be found on the website. ---  --- I purchased this item to use in my chicken coop and had anticipated that I would be able to leave it turned on at all times.  My plan was that it would recharge during the day and stay illuminated during the night.  Not possible with this unit as it can't charge the battery at all if it's left turned on.  In addition the unit I received had been previously used and returned by someone else (obvious from the packaging that it had been used before)... so I'm not the only one who thought this was worthless. ---  --- Save your money and try a different product	neg

I went to Ritz Camera today and took a good look at the TZ3. I'll tell you, its pretty nice. The build quality is really  good, as a previous person mentioned. The body is metal. The dials and buttons click with precision, and have a nice resistance. It has a nice weight to it. ---  --- I took some nice shots in the store. I must have clicked off 100 pics. I'm impressed with it. If you want something relatively small, powerful and tough, this camera is for you. The 10x zoom is great, but on such  a small camera it is difficult to hold it steady enough(at least for me) to use the zoom too much.  ---  --- I love the build quality and style, so I may be biased. It's a nice piece of equipment. I cannot speak to the photo quality only having seen pics on the camera's LCD	pos
I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait.	pos

Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate & complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over & over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT! --- 	pos
This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.  I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover.  They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people.  The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.  I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	pos
I've been using this for the last 3 months and I'm a very satisfied customer. I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors. I'm Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown   hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic. It's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me I've never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers. I'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming	pos

I love this stuff!! Five months ago I was diagnosed with having AK's (Actinic Keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). My dermatologist recommended I use Skinceuticals CE Ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (DNA mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the AK's. My skin has never been healthier!! The lesions (which were scaly, itchy, and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. My pores are smaller and I have a healthy glow. The CE Ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection.  --- HIGHLY recommended for those with AK's, uneven skin tone, large pores, or blemished or dull skin.  --- LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!	pos

Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like Lady Sovereign. She is not only lyrically impressive, but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving, which is basically what she sets out to do. I dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK, but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now. And i will patiently await for S.O.V. debut US album. ---  --- Favorite Track, though all of it is really good, will have to be "The Battle" feature other grime scene artists like Shystie, Zuz Rock, and Frost P spitting the wildest (barely understandable lol) rhymes ive heard. No men and women have battled against each other like this, especially for the listening public. ---  --- How ever, no one should compare SOV to anyone (Missy or M.I.A.) All emcees, particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such. SOV has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date. It's refreashing to see a new spin on HipHop.	pos
I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues.

It was not only a good, but also a great book because, it teaches life lessons, and it's sad in many ways, at the same time beautiful. This book teaches you that life is there, you have time. It also teaches not to judge `a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins'. And to not let sad things effect you, and so much more! I love this book so much. ---  If you're fifth grade or older, no matter what it will touch your heart. I would suggest it any day. It will be a page-turner from beginning to end. You'll never put it down. So pick it up and start reading it! ---        	pos
I am the owner of a kamado, purchased in August of 2000 when the company wan located in Sacramento, CA. After owning the unit for less than two years, I started to develop cracks in the interior of the kamado. the company would not replace or honor the life time warranty on the unit. Since that time the tiles have come loose in sheets and I have a defective unit that is unsightly and not what I purchased with the supposed lifetime warranty. All calls and emails to the company would not resolve the defects in materials and workmanship. The company's answer is to glue the tiles back on the unit. This is not acceptable for a unit of this cost. Check and see if you unit is made from ceramic materials or from Portland cement as in the case of mine. unless kamado has changed their manufacturing process in Ensenada, Mexico the units are made of Portland cement. This material will not last and carries no lifetime warranty. I am sorry to give them one star, they don't have a negative star number. check out this company with San Diego BBB and Sacramento BBB and read before you buy. There are various website that deal with the --- fraud of the kamado group. Their website does not allow any truthful posts. The truthful posts are removed almost immediately. --- As they say on eBay, BUYER BEWARE, FRAUD, AND NOT WHAT THEY REPRESENT. --- There are true ceramic cookers out there for sale, that are truly ceramic and not ceramic coated tiles in grout. --- Good Luc	neg
I bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at Circuit City out of dire necessity. I have never liked Monster Cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. Thanks to Circuit City's return policies, I was able to return this junk and get my money back. Caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the Monster Cable insanity	neg

 ---  Glamorous, mysterious, seductive all describe Armani Code, a captivating orange blossom based scent from Giorgio Armani Fragrance. ---  ---  As one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem.  Tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top.  Adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by  lace embroidery on the glass. ---  ---  The scent  is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest.  With orange blossom at its heart Armani Code is enhanced by Sambac jasmine, Madagascan vanilla and honey.  The man in my life called it "delicious," and I do, too.  It's now high on my list of favorite fragrances. ---   ---          - Gail Cook	pos
I love this bag! I purchased the pink/chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is. I am in my early 20's and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time, is very stylish.

This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.

Sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise.  They're not over-sweet nor over-hot, and they've got a lot of flavor and texture.  Over all I'd say they're among the best snacks you can buy, not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves.  However the price is pretty high for the amount you get.  Even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack, it's a little high.  However, for the occasional treat, it's well worth the price.  It's just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies	pos
At least as far as the magazine itself is concerned, but Cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage, email, and a ton of other things.

Honestly, I don't know how much more they can improve Adobe Acrobat.  It is an excellent product, and a god-send for electronic file management. ---  --- I upgraded from version 6.0.  The only problem I had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow. ---  --- This new version seems much brisker.  It loads quickly, and files seem to "print" to it much more quickly than version 6.0.  I do not utilize the "one-button" feature it provides in MS Office and other programs.  I try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible, because my previous experiences showed that they really, really bog each other down, no matter how much their makers claim they won't. ---  --- I don't come close to using all the features of Acrobat, but for my needs, it far surpasses anything else I've tried (or researched). ---  --- If you're having problems with version 6.0, or have an older version that you just want upgraded, I strongly recommend this.

What could have been a hilarious, informative account of breaking outlandish old-fashioned laws and getting (or not getting) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young British guys (I think the author is around 23) wryly making fun of America's perceived backwardness. Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking??? I'm still wondering why they included their 2-page tour of Hearst Castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log (cool, Hearst had Greco-Roman statues in his poolroom). ---  --- They don't get arrested and they don't really accomplish anything.

With the death of her infirmed husband, May, an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible, dead from the neck down, and unwelcome in the pseudo- sophisticated yuppie homes of her son, Bobby and his shallow wife, Helen, and Paula, a self- absorbed, clinging, and minimally talented daughter. The central family is anything but warm, supportive, and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband. The Mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies, the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else. ---  --- As May comes to realize the world is still important to her, the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter's boyfriend, a carpenter and rough sort. May embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with Darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first, but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him. ---  --- This is the kind of role Hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them, but they would never appear because of the frank and overt sexuality, unglamorous wardrobe, little makeup, and social commentary on the vapidness of the society most film industry women are involved. The performance by the lead actress, Anne Reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face-lift, hair extensions, and liposuction. She bares more than her soul for the screen. ---  --- Daniel Craig is the enabling handyman, Derrek who beds both mother and daughter. He turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow's situation, but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen-house. His aimless character's inability to say no to the ex-wife, boring girlfriend, and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence. While good with his hands at building a conservatory, he is unable to construct meaning in his life. ---  --- One of the best films from Britain in years, it is simply adult in its storyline. The Mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for American audiences to tolerate having no car chase, no bling, no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by TV starlets and buff studmuffins. The Mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook, send to the retirement home, and get out of the way. May doesn't know what to do as she is made alive by Darren, isn't willing to go to the old folks home, and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age	pos
I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat.  He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months.  He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy	neg
Sorry, ya just can't replace Michael Hutchence. This is a great overview of all of their greatest hits.  I am not a huge fan of greatest hits CDs b/c people tend to buy them and, therefore, miss all of the excellent songs that weren't released as singles.  All INXS CDs are worth buying separately. But, if you must.....this will work	pos
Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm not a biblical expert and really don't care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible. I would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally. ---  --- The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play. ---  --- There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary "spice" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story). ---  --- I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad. ---  --- To the movie's credit, the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn't work.	neg

This book is a place to start at best.  The main part of Middle Eastern cook that I find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices. This book calls for dried spices at times.  The dishes don't produce the food that I remember eating growing up with my family. The book is not a total loss, however.  The spinach pies are acceptable.  There are many other books out there that I would recommend first	neg

When it works it does extend the range. However, every time you turn off a wirelessly connected PC and turn it on again, the PC is not assigned an IP number. Unplug this extender, and the PC is assigned an IP number by the router without any problem. A brief power blackout will cut IP numbers to your wirelessly-connected PCs. I purchased this particular D-link range extender because I wanted to ensure that it works well with my DI-624 router. I wasted my money buying this device. It's useless, and it's too light to even serve as a door stop..	neg
I have purchased the card for my 3 years old Toshiba laptop, which has a wireless card (b) so I thought it is time to go faster. I have connected to various access points with it,but for the first  week I could not get it to connect to internet, so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all. After installing the latest driver i connected to internet, however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop's card it is very very slow.Plus, it did not see some of the networks, which i could see with my laptop's card. The Tech. guys have been very kind , but their advice did not help. --- I am very disappointed.	neg
This series is exactly what the English love about mystery and crime.  It's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like "The Shield".  That being said, this series is well done and does capture you over time.  Rather than individual crime stories, this series contains only one crime investigation.  If you like drama and cop stories, this is a good one	pos
I can't find on this website the exact tub I bought for my daughter, but this tub looks most like it.  I tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub, but that didn't work at all.  The small inflatable tub is definately the way to go.  My daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all.  It is a pain to blow the tub up, but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook, so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall.  My daughter is nearly 1 year old now, and has been using this tub for about 5 months.  There is still plenty of room for her to grow and I think she'll be using this tub for awhile.  I feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub	pos
I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose.

If you think you are buying the old Met-RX bars by the same flavors, you are in for a very very bad surprise. The old bars had better taste and a almost cake-like consistency. These were so sticky that I could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one.  Also, I couldn't get past the taste. Even the color is different.  ---  --- I never finished the bar and I used to eat one a day (years ago). I gave the entire box away for free. ---  --- I will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe.	neg
I've been a big fan of Ener-G Foods alternative food products. Ever since I discovered that I was Wheat and Gluten allergic, these have been my only substitutes for breads.

These are so good that I don't even miss regular  Wheat breads and cookies	pos

Looked at them all and then bought this software... it can do a lot of things so, yes, it might take a bit to learn and get fast with.  ---  --- There is a reason it has been voted best for several years now.

Why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker.  I can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book. ---  --- The wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous.

I've owned this cd, but didn't keep it for very long because it's too poppy and slick for my tastes. I guess when about 1981 came around Billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70's style, and on this offering, he kind of wanted a 50's or 60's kind of sound. This stuff is just to slick for this hombre. He never made a solid album, after the release of GLASS HOUSES, in about 1980. This is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about, but if you've got some integrity, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one, and buy anything he recorded in the 70's	neg

Not to be disrespectful but are you people for real? I can't believe this book is getting 4 and 5 stars. There was nothing good about this book. A bunch of people in the book did not even matter, Bill Kendall's wife, the new anchor man Pete whatever his last name was, the boss Yelena, Eliza's boyfriend, the priest, even the soon-to-be-president and his wife, I mean what's the point in even mentioning them? They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much. Really disappointing. As I said I don't mean to be disrespectful, but to give this book 5stars, you must have read either bedtime stories all your life, or not have read anything.  --- DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY that's all i have to say. sorr	neg
I ordered two of the items above in error.  I did not think the first order was submitted properly so therefore a second one was ordered and came from Antonline.  I have been trying since Dec. 19 to return the wide angle lens and adapter to them.  I am 71 years old and not computer savvy.  I just wish I could get return labels and my account credited.  They are still in the original packing as received and never been opened.  Thank you for being interested. I was informed by them that my time had expired.  I do not believe this to be true, or does your opening web page not apply to them.	neg
When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced	neg
I bought this DVD because I really adore the Strokes.  Good music, good people, good style...not so good documentary.  Whoever made this video should not make anymore at all!

No sound from any of the strokes & no interviews with them...I can go on.  I mean c'mon...a documentary of the Strokes should at least have the Strokes in it, right	neg

   When you look at the cover, you think it's about a fantastic trip into a Black Hole, and what they find inside, but it isn't. It's about a Nemo wannabe wanting to enter the Black Hole. I especially did not like the ending. Overall I would rate it: ---  --- Story-3 Stars --- Actors-4 Stars --- Music-4 Stars --- Ending-0 Stars --- Overall- 2 Stars ---  ---  I am not insulting Disney, I think it came out just how "they" wanted it to. And, as with most Disney movies, the only PG part is violence. I liked the actors and the Robots, but other than that, it is a waste of money	neg
I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like "Painful." But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia	neg
I was skeptical about buying this at first, but after seeing it in Allure, and reading the various reviews on amazon, I decided to try it. --- I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised; it does what it says. It won't work on cyctic acne or if the pimple has already come to a head. It does work on pimples that are just beginning.. those hard, tender knots deep under your skin you just know are going to be huge in a day or two. I've used it on two pimples that were red bumps, and both were mostly gone within 24 hours. Completely gone in less than 3 days. Usually it would have taken 7-10 days for them to go away, and it would have been UGLY	pos
During the 1960's, when my sister subscribed to AHMM, the stories mirrored the fantastic television show; the stories were primarily mysterious, creepy, and unique, with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great.  Now, the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain, uninteresting "detective" stories.  I subscribed up until about the early 1980's, but stopped because of the same old boring "cops and robbers" material.  I tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop, but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that AHMM hadn't changed. Subscribe only if you are a fan of pure "police" fiction	neg
   I am so pleased with this purchase!! Under normal circumstances if I spend anything over $1.00 I get caught in a spiral of buyers regret. This is a feeling that I have grown accustomed to. When I received the 800,000 through the mail I shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images I could play with. I was astonished!       ---    Then, I realized something.....or rather a lack of something. I felt no remorse for buying this! I finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages, labels, calendars, scrapbooks, and everything else I wanted to do. 	pos
I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel	neg

This thing just doesn't work, don't bother.  It won't stay upright no matter what you do, so there's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  The most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason.	neg
If you like movies as I do, this DVD set should satisfy any film fanatic with over 21 (that's right) extra features--clearly a prototype of what we film fans want in our DVD sets.  ---  --- To see producer Irwin Allen in his Rolls Royce and a pink polyester leisure suit (complete with white shoes) discussing the finer points of 'The Poseidon Adventure" and "Towering Inferno" as he takes us on a tour through 20th Century Fox is as informative as it is funny.  ---  --- Commentaries by film historian F.X. Feeney and SFX director, Mike Vezina, add another dimension to understanding this interesting film.   ---  --- Much has already been written about this film itself by the other Amazon critics here, suffice to say the acting in this motion picture (save for the two little brats in Jennifer Jones' charge) is quite good with Newman as the architect and and McQueen as the fire captain, both excellently cast.  Then again, when have these actors ever disappointed audiences in their respective roles?  ---  --- Veterans Faye Dunaway and Bill Holden rarely disappoint, Richard Chamberlain is downright creepy, and even Fred Astaire (at 80 years of age when this was made) manages to inject some needed satire here and there as he tries to woo Jennifer Jones. For those from the SF Bay Area, the setting for this movie was San Francisco and the distinctive lobby of the Hyatt Regency at Embarcadero was used for many of the scenes in the first half of the movie.  ---  --- Ok, this is not going to be a long review, and the film does not really impart any substantial revelations about life and death. I could get very deep and argue that the film is a metaphor to man's vanity and ego dedicated to the capitalistic excesses of power, wealth and greed, but let's get real--it's just one damn exciting movie with excellent special effects (Academy Awards for Cinematography and Editing), reasonably good acting all around, and edge-of-your-seat entertainment.    ---  --- I just hope they don't make another remake a la "The Poseidon Adventure" for this film--Irwin Allen's rendition will do just fine. 	pos
I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  --- French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying. ---  --- Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more.	neg
This headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work.

These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites	pos
This is a film like none other you have ever seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it. ---  --- From the "reviews" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who don't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it. ---  --- This film is not literal.  Learn to *think* about what you are watching.  To interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor. ---  --- A clue: the Lady character is named STORY.  Now why might that be? ---  --- And why would she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world? ---  --- And what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent? ---  --- And why are there THREE of those monkeys? ---  --- This film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world.  If you aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this.   ---  --- But that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says, and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it. ---  --- Magical.	pos
I read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit.

This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk.  ---  --- The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device. ---  --- This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared	neg

I have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall.  It used to be a disaster and I was introduced and used Tend Skin for the past two or three years now.  I got a sample of Solution 2 out in the Hamptons last weekend and I could not possibly be happier.  It is a significant improvement over Tend Skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and I have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag.  It does not sting nearly as much as Tend Skin.  It smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too.  I used to get very dry patches on my neck from using Tend Skin but I have had no dryness issues with Solution 2.  I used to have a strict regimen using Tend Skin in order to get through my shaving procedure.  Now, I roll on the Solution 2 and it's all good:) 	neg

Okay, first of all, this game is a VERY violent game, and i would NOT recommend parents to buy it for children under 13. You must also make sure that they know the violence and crime is FAKE. There will be serious consequences for doing these things in real life, and they know not to do what they do in this game. Back to the game, this is simply, hands down, the best game ever created. It is an innovation within an innovaton. The storyline is excellent, as you get betrayed and shot by your friend during a bank robbery. Later, you must work your way through the dark streets of Liberty City, working your way toward the ones who betrayed you. The missions never repeat themselves, and they are always fun and challenging. BUT, you WILL NOT be able to beat this game without codes, and i do not know anyone who did. So i strongly advise you get the codes before playing. Other than that, the sense of freedom this game gives you in between and after all of the missions is astounding. You can go almost anywhere, and do almost anything, something never before acheived in a video game.  ---  --- Gameplay- 5+- Extremely fun and addictive, especially when you have a group of your friends around you to see your crazy runs from the law and laugh as you drive your car off a cliff into the ocean (nothing beats the feeling when you watch your friend do the same thing). ---  --- Sound- 5- The radio stations are great, especially game fm. The commercials are extremely hilarious, and you can even make your own custom radio station with your own tunes. ---  --- Graphics- 4- Allright, but could be better. ---  --- Storyline- 5- Great story, very fun missions. ---  --- I really have to congratulate rockstar with their acheivment in the video game industry. Great job guys. As for the people reading this, if this game is on its way to your house right now, click the buy button above. Bottom line- WOW	pos
This will be the third time I have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art, experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music.	neg

This talented woman can sing anything. I really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work. Renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose. Hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business - Cassandra Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Regina Belle, Sarah Vaughan, etc. This cd of different musical styles reminds me of Nina Simone and Cassandra Wilson, two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special. I loved all the songs and the standouts here are "Haunted Heart", "River", "My One and Only Love", "My Cherie Amour", "Cancao do Amor", and Beatles "In My Life", and "Hard Times Come Again No More".  --- I hope Renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because I'll certainly always listen	pos

I bought my K10D in Dec 06 after owning a number of Pentax cameras over the years and being very pleased with the engineering. The combination of features, if executed properly, make this camera the best buy in 10MP DSLRs right now.  I postponed my review because I wanted to get some real field experience.  I just went to Mexico, and panicked because I left the camera instruction manual behind.  I can now report on that trip. I did a little fumbling at first, mainly because I didn't have the manual, but I was soon able to find the combinations I wanted, and the camera performed both flexibly and intuitively.  The AF button and the exposure compensation button are very well placed.  I found myself in difficult lighting situations often, and both AF and exposure metering worked quite well.  I also took some hand-held shots that I normally would use a tripod with (such as at 450mm), and very few came out fuzzy because of camera movement.  In a few cases, I used bracketing, and was easily able to obtain a good balance of details in one or more of the bracketed shots.  Exposure metering worked so well that I stopped bracketing.  I particularly liked the display modes: I could boost the brightness to see the display even in bright daylight, and deep zooming gave me a good check of whether a shot was "soft" or not right at the scene.  The rechargeable Li Ion batteries, although not readily available in stores, seem to last forever (even using power zoom, and full-bright display, and some fill flash).  I believe that I could have shot all week (700 shots in RAW (DNG) + JPEG) with the battery grip attached. In summary, this camera was a pleasure to hold, very easy to use and manipulate, and resulted in a high percentage of crisp photos (even if the percentage of well-composed shots was lower because of the photographer).  I bought it because of its compatibility with Pentax lenses, 10MP sensor, shake-reduction technology, larger display, and especially the dust and water seals.  But what makes me quite happy about it is its overall ease of use and good results.  I am still discovering its features, but I already know that this camera frees me to be creative in ways that other cameras have not in the past.  Some of the features on this camera are unique (new program lines) and some are available only on cameras costing several hundred dollars more, making the K10D a good choice and a best buy.  Once again for Pentax, the engineering is supurb.  	pos

My fiance (now wife) and I have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.  Her pubic region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold Bond (not together and not in any particular order).  We also tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in the more intimate of areas.  At this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$ and commit to an irrevocable decision.  Although, based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style. ---  --- The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.   ---  --- Just take it easy around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation. ---  --- I suppose, although we have no interest in it, that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into shapes and designs.  Hey what ever works for you and/or you an your partner	pos
I had purchased a Levenger palm pilot and writing pad case, which came with loops for a pen and pencil, but did not come with any appropriately sized for the compact case.

These work great initially...I bought six of them. Of the six, four broke. One stopped altogether, one stopped oscillating, and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed. I bought them in May and they broke after 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. They are expensive fans, and I was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability. They were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all.  I have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch. These are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty (this is 1 year)and higher quality components.	neg
I love these type of memoirs. A person who is not boasting about their skill or having an attitude. Simply shares the love of his work and love of his county.

I bought this for our camping trip to the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.  The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you're securing the screw-on valve.  Unfortunatly, the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly. ---  --- What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm, but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover. So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have.   ---  --- I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight, and the pump was robust and quick. However, the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product	neg
I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD.  ---  --- Was also disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own.  ---  --- This album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.	neg

I discovered them in Europe years ago and was very happy to find them here.  I use almost all their notebooks, specially, the small pocket type with squared paper.  They are practical and elegant. I carry them with me everywhere for taking notes, drawing and designing.  The planners are my favorite agendas.  Since I prefer the weekly planner because it is compact, the integration of a single ruled notebook page between pages in the 2007 model, that actually permits you to expand your annotations when necessary, is a great bonus.

Maybe the S120 will work for you, but it was nothing but trouble for me.  I bought it because of the great features and price, but returned it because of all the problems: 1) The manual is anything but friendly, e.g. after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there's a short cut.  Thanks.  2) After spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in, I'm off to exercise.  Great start, the reading is my usual pulse around 55, then it drops out to 0.  Ok, maybe the contacts are too dry, so I wet them.  Off I go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0.  Ok, maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly.  Different position, same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map.  I decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise.  Final result -- I got periods of reasonable heart rates, but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190.  The next day I try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings.  It went back later that day	neg

My 7 yr. old son is allergic to mosquito bites, plus I'm concerned about West Nile virus.  Unfortunately, mosquitoes love him, and he always get some really nasty bites when he is sleeping.  I bought this little unit, and now have peace of mind!  I turn this on in his room for about half an hour at bedtime, leaving his door open, then turn it off and close his door.  Any mosquitoes lurking in his room have been driven out by the geranium scent.  I do the same in my own bedroom, and I am very pleased with the results. ---  --- The geranium scent is rather strong, but not unpleasant.  I don't find it necessary to leave this on all night, so it's not a problem.  I also like that you can clip this on your belt and turn it on for when you are outside.  It's just a tiny little fan blowing through the geranium scented cartridge, so it is small and light-weight	pos

The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design.  It does not go with the center design.  I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look.  Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either. 	neg

Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude. ---  --- On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth. ---  --- I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?  ---  --- 90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.  ---  --- Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats. ---  --- At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: --- "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK. ---  --- "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer) ---  --- Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion. ---  --- Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: --- "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra. ---  --- Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep."

Since most of the complaints are from recent switchers I went ahead and bought this because most of their problems don't apply to me (running on PowerPC, no old data to transfer), and because intuit offers a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee.  Oh, and i downloaded it from their site, saving like 5 bucks. ---  --- Here's the thing.  The QFX file that quicken uses to get data from financial institutions is restricted.  My bank offers the download, so i can get the file just fine.  However, part of quicken's import process is an internet check with the bank to see if they "support" mac users.  By support, all that really means is the bank pays quicken to allow mac users to import their QFX files.  If not, you get an error message saying to try the import again later.  There is a hack floating around the 'net that invloves changing some of the text in the QFX file, and it works.  BUT there are cheaper alternatives out there that support the format (moneydance is one) with no fuss. ---  --- Aside from this issue, the interface is really bad. It looks like a check register.  If I wanted a glorified spreadsheet in the shape of my checkbook, i would have made one.  The program is not even close to intuitive, which means if you dislike/avoid tracking your finances like me this software will scare you away pretty effectively, making your purchase pointless. ---  --- Lastly, the customer support is really very bad.  You basically get canned responses that don't even really address the questions you ask, in semi-broken English. ---  --- I'm sure that someone with banks that have mac supported QFX, tons of patience, and is predisposed to dealing with accounting minutiae would find this program useful/powerful.  For me, all the advanced features in the world don't matter if i can't even use the most basic ones	neg

We afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre. Meanwhile, John Adams has impressed me with this disc.

I have been a Smart Money subscriber for over three years. I must say that each month I look forward to receiving the new issue. It needs to be said (to those who aren't aware) that this is a publication of the Wall Street Journal. There isn't as much market news but the writing is just as good. From undervalued stock picks, to mutual fund screening and research, finding cheap bottles of good wine, car ratings, retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years. I find the writing to be accurate and insightful. I would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $3 per issue. That's the true value I find in it. Hands down it's the best personal finance magazine around. Head and shoulders above Money & Kiplingers	pos
I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)   --- I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else.	pos

"The Talons of Weng Chiang" is a wonderfully creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood, atmosphere, and an unusual amount of violence for "Doctor Who"--almost as if departing producer Philip Hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out. But it's not all gloom and doom. This storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old "Doctor Who" humor at its funniest as well as thrilling "Doctor Who" adventure at its most gruesome. The dank and dour city streets and slums of late-19th century London make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation, madness, and serial murder (technologically refined cannibalism, really), and yet the Doctor's many clever quips and Leela's naively astute observations on "civilized" Victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout, and the main villain's second-hand man, Li-Hsen Chang, has some incredibly witty one-liners as well. ---  --- Li-Hsen Chang himself is a fascinating character, delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to "Weng-Chiang," a stranded, time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived Chang into believing he's a deity from the Taoist pantheon. Chang's paranormal powers, foremost of which is hypnotism, definitely evoke the late Victorian fascination with mesmerism (see the poster advertising his show) and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil Fu Manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction, and yet he's also a tragic figure in many ways--a healthy, innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man--uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his "god" and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process. In many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the Pygmalion-style educational program the Doctor's putting Leela through, to her annoyance. ---  --- If Li-Hsen Chang is an interesting and complex adversary though, the same can't really be said for his master, Weng-Chiang himself. He's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional villain, I'm afraid, complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and over-the-top acting. Perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect, but if so, they overdid it just a bit. At times too he's just more annoying than frightening--every time the ever loyal Li-Hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the Doctor, Weng-Chiang throws a fit, savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum. On this score, Weng-Chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one's workplace. It doesn't help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he's presumably impersonating, so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing. ---  --- All in all, though, this is an enjoyable adventure. The Doctor is at his sleuthing best, Leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior, and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion, all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting. And anyway, Li-Hsen more than makes up for Weng-Chiang's deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show, while the cyborg assassin Mr. Sin is genuinely creepy (especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls). So this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt--or a dash of soy sauce, rather	pos
I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better! --- So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album "Feels Like Home" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. --- She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat. --- But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better	neg
Like the reviewer below, my dryer also stopped working within a short period. It was never dropped or misused -- after about a month, it simply refused to turn on when plugged in. --- Now, there is a decent warranty for the product.

This pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it -- pour out all the water -- the filter comes crashing out! It's top-heavy. I much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge. It may be clumsy to refill -- which is why I thought I'd try a pitcher -- but it's extremely easy to use	neg
After finishing both "Half Life Episode I" and "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay" over a few days, I was looking for another fun first person shooter game that would let me pass away an hour or so a day, and allow me to unwind by slaughtering a constant flow of enemies with high powered weapons without resulting in the actual murder of innocent people. I'd heard that "Far Cry" was pretty good, so I bought it, installed it and got ready to blast. ---  --- The first thing I noticed is the astonishing graphics engine. It's without a doubt the most beautiful environment ever created for an FPS. My jaw was on the floor for the first few hours, checking out the ridiculously high detailed environment. The outdoor scenery looks like a paradise holiday destination with crystal clear blue water and lush green jungle. There is birdlife, fish and a general feeling that you're running around a living, breathing world. ---  --- One thing was very different right from the start and would play a major role in later missions. There is no save game option! There are checkpoints littered around the levels, but it can occasionally be around 10 to 20 minutes of solid game-play between them. At first this just annoyed me since I found myself reloading over and over on some of the harder missions. I couldn't just run into the fray, firing my weapon left, right and centre at anything that moves because one headshot would send me back a heck of a long way in some instances. I was forced to change my style of play from all out assault, to a stealthy, crawling, breath-holding, sweating, nerve wracking approach. I rediscovered the part of myself that loved "Thief: The Dark Project" so very much all those years ago. Yet I still got to combine that approach with levels of general carnage when it was simply unavoidable. I am now a firm believer that the save game option should be removed from many other (not all) first person games out there as it raises the intensity level dramatically. ---  --- The story itself is fairly average and the dialogue even more so, which is really what places "Far Cry" below the likes of "Half Life". You are basically just following instructions the entire game, used as a violent killing machine with no real choices. But for some reason, I just didn't care as I was so absorbed by the surroundings and simply surviving that it didn't lower my enjoyment. The enemies have very good AI, flanking me whenever possible and generally actually trying to avoid being shot rather than running straight at me. There are plenty of occasions though where an enemy will just stand there in the distance while you shoot them from plain sight, but generally all is good. The weapons are fantastic being both highly effective and satisfying to use. The sniper rifle as always is a personal favourite and this game makes awesome use of it, with massive maps of open ground. ---  --- While initially I was prepared for a standard "Serious Sam" type of game, "Far Cry" turned out to be so much more. Some fantastic graphics, inspired level design, forced variations of play and some fiercely intense gunfights make this game an absolute winner. You can add value for money as well since there are 20 long missions to get through. With no save option, those 20 will take you a long time to complete. But you will love it! I sure did	pos
I purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers. We are all on our feet all day long. After one other coworker told us about the one he had, we all had to have one to help our tired feet. Everyone of us is very happy with this product. It is a great value for the price. There are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We did have a problem with one, but Amazon quickly exchanged it for us. I think it was defective from the factory. Great product and even better service from Amazon	pos

In my opinion, Sony's strength lies in its TVs.  This line of LCD sets are expensive, but you'll definitely get what you pay for.  The picture quality is incredible!  The beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art.  While the internal speakers are decent, I would have been just as happy not to have them.  But thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel, you don't even know the speakers are there. ---  --- Some reviewers have mentioned "LCD clouding", and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate Google search.  But Sony stands by its products, and if you receive a set that is not up to standards, they will rectify the situation.  Also, many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture.  It is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the TV, and what signal will give you the optimal image.  Not all HD signals are the same, and will provide you with varying degrees of quality.  Be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device.  But, I have yet to see a signal that wasn't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous Panasonic tube set. ---  --- The interchangable bezels is a nice idea, but only for those with deep(er) pockets.  The silver set alone is beautiful, and if I had only one complaint, it would be that it's harder to get matching Sony peripherals in silver than you might think.  All in all, it's the best LCD you can buy	pos
I really enjoyed this game.  Yes, it is not perfect, but it is definitely worth the price of the game.  If you're looking for escape back to the old West, then this is your game.  As many of the reviewers have mentioned, there are some flaws in the game - if you can get past them, then I am positive you will enjoy the game.   ---  --- The horse riding is fun, but I also found myself enjoying the plot - it plays like a movie.  The cut scenes are great fun to watch and are well (voice) acted.  The graphics are detailed as well.  I found that the artists took their time in modeling the weaponry of the era and it likely very historically accurate (a big plus). ---  --- If you have ever wanted to be the "star" of a Western, this is your chance.  If you like TV shows and movies such as Gunsmoke, Deadwood, and Once Upon a Time in the West you'll probably wonder where this game has been...I did.	pos
After doing extensive research on the web, I purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor. While the Easy Fit cuff was easy to place, the B/P readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous B/P cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor's office.  Since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings, I returned the B/P cuff to Amazon for a refund. 	neg
I just used this program to make wills and healthcare directives for my wife and me. I have the book-CD version. I recommend it over just the CD, because it is a better financial deal, and you do not have to read a PDF online or print it out. --- Here are some of the features that I thought were worth noting: --- * The program divides a document into sections and shows you a list of those sections, indicating which sections you have done. You can resume the interview at the beginning of any section and make changes from that point on. --- * After doing one will, you can go to the File menu and Save for Spouse. This creates a copy of the will with the spouses names interchanged. Then you can go through the interview and make any needed changes. --- * In the process of answering the questions, the program accumulates the names of people you mention into an editable contact list. After you mention someone once, the next time you need them you can simply select them from a list. This is handy when doing the healthcare directive, which needs to show contact information, if you have already entered that information when doing the will. It is also handy if you decide to redo portions of either document. When working on one family member's document, you can import contacts from another's document. --- * The program does not appear to provide the option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The only way to list two or more alternate executors is to have two or more of them serve together. This is ironic, since the program recommends having only one executor at a time. Although I wanted to name my wife, children, and then siblings as alternate executors, I decided to accept just having my wife and son as executor and alternate. If all of us die in an auto accident while taking a trip together, then there is hopefully time for the probate court to name an executor. It would just be more expedient to have one already named. --- * I contacted customer support asking them to enhance the program to add an option to list of two or more alternate executors to serve one at a time in the order named. The response stated why they chose to omit that option ("The editors choose to limit the number of fields for Beneficiaries and Executors to prevent the program from becoming to unwieldy") and some options (export the document and add the language or return the program). I was disappointed that they did not embrace my suggestion (I disagreed that it would make the program too unwieldy, since they already allow you to list multiple Beneficiaries and Executors that serve together at the same time), but I liked that I received a prompt response that indicated they had read my note and knew what I was talking about, and that they gave an honest, direct answer. --- * At the end of the interview you can review the document as it will print. You can then print it directly to a printer, or export it as plain text or RTF. Exporting to RTF is handy if you need to change the document (they advise against changing it) or print it somewhere else. However, the RTF is not identical to printing directly. I noticed two differences. (1) Pagination can be different, and as explained by the program, getting the pagination right is important for legal reasons. (2) The footer is always different: the directly printed copy says how many total pages, whereas the RTF one does not. If you cannot print directly to a printer, I recommend printing to a PDF to maintain the pagination and other features. If you do not have a way to create a PDF, get a free PDF Writer (search on that term). When you print the document to PDF, print it as prepress so you embed the fonts.	pos

I must admit I had no idea what they were, but my daughter wanted them.  --- I was disappointed that all you do is basically rub the pins together to get another color. This color did not last long so you had to keep doing that little process to get the colors to blend.  My daughter who is 7 lost interest quickly.  She uses them like regular markers.  I could have paid 5 dollars for a new pack of markers. As for the material to use them on, she used them all in a couple of hours. 	neg

I have to say that I have been converted. For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type of razor, but now I find it's not the best shave. I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn't shave often. (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had. The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow. My fiancé has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different and when I told him, he went out and bought one too, he also loves it now. My fiancé said she would leave me if I stopped using the Panasonic, it's a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles. The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it, I have charged it twice but it really didn't need it as it said the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don't think it can get any better. This product does not include the cleaning base. I do recommend it as even if you don't use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying. But, if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor, this is it!	pos

Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years	pos

Most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product.  I think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly, this trimmer works.  Because of its design, best results are obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and the procedure repeated.  Second tip: rinse the rotating blade, switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc, after each use.  It works better when clean. ---  --- The main PLUS of this product is its size.  Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty.  But it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available	pos
There is no denying that Star Wars Battlefront is one of the best video game series that is currently available. The first game was really amazing, let us participate in some of the places seen in all six movies. But, even though the game was really fun, it felt like there was something still missing. The missing piece was put in and this is the result. This is not a disappoinment, but the best!  ---  --- Unlike the first game when the main story gameplay was just caputring bases and killing all of the enemy forces, here, there are actually missions to complete. From having to retrieve data-discs, to killing rebel leaders, this game is more indepth than it's predecessor. In game, there are still times when bases have to be captured, like in the first game, but you no longer have to kill all of the enemies. The coolest part of the game is that you get to ride in different ships and other things from the movies. Lots of fun!! ---  --- So, overall, this game really is an improvement over the first but some may prefer the first more. The reason being that the first game is basically kill everyone and take their bases, and that is less seen here with the focus is more on protecting things and stealing things.	pos

It has an inbound firewall to keep bad stuff out of your computer. If bad stuff gets through the firewall, it has antivirus to stop it from affecting your system and an outbound firewall to keep it from spreading. If that doesn't stop the bad stuff, it makes sure you have a backup of your data on a separate drive or on CDs. --- In the past, I haven't bought security products. There are plenty of free ones on the market that do a satisfactory job. However, ever since I tried OneCare as a beta tester, I fell in love with it. It is simple to use. --- Reduce your worries about being online down to OneCare and try it today. You can even install it on other computers to help keep friends and family protected	pos
I had high hopes for this series when I started watching it, though I guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover.  Shandala is truly a wonderful character, pure and good, and the characterization of her is very tender, so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting.  Oh, how wrong of me to think so, because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings, the message of "hope" the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the "truth" is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent, good woman is the only way to save the world!  Spare me.  And if you think that I am disgusted by this message, just imagine what the Muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the Koran and the Muslim character's final opinions.  Although the story is technically good, I'm only giving it one star for the message of despair.   	neg
Great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike. More of an end-of-the-night activity... unless you're just having a dessert party of course!

If you like the Beach Boys and appreciate the technical quality behind Telarc recordings, then this disc is a must have in your collection.

This is a very cheaply built product.  We had a hard time getting it to mist at all.

The Maestro, the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the Hulk, comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty Apocalypse.  Apocalypse being the kick butt 14" giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series. ---  --- Maestro Hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst.  His beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head.  He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you.  Overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey Hulk from the Galactus series.  Talk about alpha and omega	pos

The six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product.  I purchased this to use as an interface between a CD Walkman player and the AC power cord.  The heads have specific polarity; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly.  However, if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated, it's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time.  I found the product to work effectively.  The only negative I can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting, the AH3WH can be a bit of a plug hog.  However, other than that limitation, the product was reliable.  Recommended to save on those batteries which do add up	pos
This is definitely NOT one of my favorite books about stocks.  The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits. ---  --- Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year.  I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know.  ---  --- Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.   ---  --- Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  This is not something that I use or will use in my trading.  ---  --- Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter 	neg
Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.  ---  --- I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book! ---  --- 	neg

The problems I had with this gate: ---  --- 1. The instructions for using the template to install the hinges, for the fixed gate, was not easy to understand. I finally gave up and I improvised. Doing so, the installation went more smoothly. --- 2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break. --- 3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work. ---  --- Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it.

There's not much to say about the reputation of these movies.  There's also little to say about these DVDs, many of which are the high quality special edition collections. ---  --- Just do the math.  This is no brainer for people who don't own any of these DVDs.  Even if you only want 8 of them (less than half!), that's about $20.00 a movie (at Amazon's present sales price) and since many of these movies are special editions, that's still a steal! ---  --- This is a solid place to start your DVD collection.  Not everyone will enjoy all these movies (after all, they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals), but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings. ---  --- One note:  the version of Amadeus here is the reissue and the longer, director's cut of the movie that was not originally released.  Some (including myself) prefer the tighter original release (which can still be gotten at Amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie!)	pos
I love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it.  From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I've ever owned.  I've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise. 	neg
Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!? ---  --- Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false. ---  --- Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible. ---  --- But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself.	neg
I love Auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume "Pink Sugar"  to death but it is such an overpowering scent that I am often smelled before I am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate. ---  --- Aquolinas new perfume "Chocolovers" is similarly sweet, but much subtler. ---  --- If you love the sweet scent of Pink Sugar but don't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away, try Chocolovers	pos
This worked for only a couple days. Although the belt/pocket clip held my Treo securely, it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way. After a cople of days, the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time...after a couple more days it was useless. ---  --- Save your money on this one..	neg
I purchased this to put on the changing table.  I was looking for something that would fit on top of the table next to the changing mat and would hold diapers, wipes, lotions,etc.  I purchased and returned two other baskets for various reasons then I found this one.  It fits perfectly and holds the wipes container, several diapers, lotion, hair brush, etc.  I love that it has separate pockets to hold small items so that they dont fall over.  This allows everything to be within easy reach while changing the baby.  The price was also reasonable.  I was looking at buying one from Pottery Barn for twice the amount.  This basket is a great buy	pos
I've had a silicone case on my Treo 650 for a long time.  It was thin and the rubber was very grippy (great anti-slip)- once I left my Treo on top of my car (NOT recommended) and drove 10 miles, and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when I arrived!    After it finally broke I ordered this one to replace it.   The rubber on the Boxwave case is much thicker than my original case, so much so that it's difficult to use the 5-way navigator without it doing what I didn't want it to do.  The case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat, unlike the original.  Boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive- since this isn't, I probably won't bother. But in my opinion, there's better products out there	neg
This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid.  It's easy enough to install but hello!  What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together?  Not a thing!

Total and complete piece of junk!!	neg

Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference	neg
Having drooled over the Goodtimes dvd for years now, I did a flip and a half when I saw Universal was releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story. I refrained from doing two flips when I remembered it was Universal and then saw no mention of special features. What? Look at the potential for bonuses! There was an alternate ending, there were deleted scenes, how about a featurette?! Argh! I just wept and wept. And then months later the release date comes, I tear the dvd open and the movie starts automatically - I hit menu and get the nagging old "operation prohibited by disc" usually reserved for fast forwarding through those tired old FBI warnings. There's not even a menu! No scene selection. Geez. Do these corporate monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to have simple menus? I'd like to sit down and analyze the brilliance of Sarandon and Spader, note how Spader's hair changes near the end because of reshoots, but I'm just too raving mad at Universal right now. 	pos
After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106).  My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff.  I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well. ---  --- The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually.  If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money	neg
I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store.  I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions.  It outputs very bright light at full blast.  The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches. ---  --- The only three issues I have with this lantern are: --- 1. Sucks the propane.  I also have the coleman fuel lantern, and while it is not as bright, it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel.   --- 2. Loud.  This lantern is loud when burning.  The above mentioned lantern is much quieter. --- 3. Construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern. ---  --- I'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light, but if you are looking for value, go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern. 	pos

For the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  Problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading	neg
Two moderately decent-looking white people who apparently aren't very good at sex go at it in this movie. If that's your thing, why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it? At least then you won't have to listen to the cornball pseudo-artistic dialogue in this film. What a crock. They could at least have cast a fine young sista like Rosario Dawson or Gabrielle Union to make this movie moan and squeal! This movie makes sex seem boring	neg
Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal	neg
This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious???? ---  --- Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk. ---  --- I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being. ---  --- Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself. ---  --- Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy	neg
The video-editing component of this package, Video Wave, worked great for me for about a year, but it has recently turned into a NIGHTMARE!

When I tried this program out, I at first had some trouble running it. But Then I went to the website at: www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select EasySpeak Spanish. They give you a link for the version of Flash 8 you need to run. After this everything worked well. ---  --- While some may have been offended by bathing suits. Not me and not my kids. There is absolutly nothing obscene here folks.  ---  --- This program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly! And it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios. Very artistic and fun. You can go to the bank, the hospital, and several different places, learn a new set of words and situations. that you could really use in a foreign country. My hats off to the designers and creators of this program. Well done!! Bravo! Muy Bien. 	pos
I purchased this camera to use with my previous church's media ministry, based on my trial use of the VX2000.  That was three years ago.  This camera is STILL running as well as it did when I bought it. I use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and DVD production, plus, I get great digital audio recordings when I plug directly into my current church's sound system.  The ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible.  Now that I am creating a multimedia team for our church, I've convinced the church to buy one for themselves	pos
I am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru, but based on my experience with this product I am very satisfied.

If you have the money and will love to have a new Office Suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day, go for it	pos
These earrings are really pretty.  There are not real great variations in the color between each set (they are all pastel, after all!) but each has a beautiful sheen and color. ---  --- They are also set very firmly on the backs - I was worried that, for the price, they wouldn't hold up.  But they are very nicely made. ---  --- The packaging was okay, but not deluxe.  What I appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls, which I found informative. ---  --- All in all a good purchase and well worth the money	pos

For the $50 bucks you pay here, you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime.  That's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere, it would be $20 bucks, and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so.  Plus tax. So cost works about to be about the same.  Frankly, I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere.  ---  --- Regarding the sim card, I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion.  A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD -electro static discharge- just like computer RAM is.  ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed.  I'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows.  Before you handle the sim card, you should "ground" yourself by touching something metal.  Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD. ---  --- The phone itself is OK.  It's BASIC.  Emphasis on the basic.    I just transferred my mobile # from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139, about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display.  Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper.  IMO, Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model.  It was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c -also in the same price range- has such a port.   ---  --- Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time.  I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday (10/28/06) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone.  Also, it is an entirely new network.  In Southern California, the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular.   ---  --- Suffice it to say, I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly, however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number. And around and around it goes.  I anticipate nothing but problems with "technical support" when I contact them.  They are very polite as customer service reps, however they can barely speak or understand English.  I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever. Note to Tracfone:  Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT.   ---  --- Also, I wasn't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging.  The V120c is actually more intuitive. It's much easier to use.  But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the V120c, TracFone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message.  I'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone.  It should be one uniform deduction across the board.  Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon. ---  --- Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an *inexpensive* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display.  Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for $20 bucks.  But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper, and a little more flexibility, then get yourself a Nokia 2126. For the same money you spend here, the Nokia is a better phone.  It has a USB port, a speakerphone, plus other extras.  And you probably won't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either.	pos

If you are a small frame person or a short person these will work fine for you. The white is thin and you can see through it so i don't reccomend buying white on this brand. The t-shirts run very small. A size x-large fits both of us very big on most brands but this brand was so tight we could not even get it on so these run very small. They are also short. 29 inches is short for a man's t-shirt. If you are tall, i would not recommend this t-shirt.  ---  --- The t-shirt is soft, not scratchy and the style is nice. We only had problems with the sizing and of course the white being so thin that it is see through	neg

Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method.  Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language.  The disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety. ---  --- The Rosetta Stone lessons are quick, easy and fun to do, thus encouraging usage.  If you can afford it I would definitely recommend combining Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone.  Both are excellent products and far better than less expensive products commonly available.  But neither alone is sufficient for effective learning of a language. ---  --- Could Rosetta Stone be improved?  Certainly.  More diverse and better graphics would help.  The graphics they use are very good but occasionally a picture isn't quite clear as to meaning.  For example if you are supposed to select "a boy on a horse" you may not realize it is a boy on the horse. ---  --- If you are questioning if you should get Rosetta Stone or not, just get a free demo CD from their website and try it yourself.  As far as I can tell the full product is exactly the same as the demo but obviously you have access to more lessons	pos
I have had three of these Logitech Wireless controllers now.  They have all broken nearly seven months to the day I buy them.   ---  --- The problem is the same every time, the left analog stick breaks. ---  --- My girlfriend got me my first one in December 2004 (Christmas).  It lasted until about July 2005.  I exchanged it at the store, and the new one lasted until maybe February 2006.  I exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in September 2006.   ---  --- I am not really a heavy gamer.  I play Madden and NCAA 2007 sparingly.  I am very disappointed with this repeat problem.   ---  --- I also notice the "X" button sticking issue that others refer to here.  I tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick.  That seemed to work for a while.   ---  --- You really can't beat the convenience of wireless, and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability. 	pos

Pest Control is a light-hearted book which uses a fast pace and off-the-wall humor to make up for any depth problems. ---  --- Standard story. Upstart assassin bursts onto the scene, creating mayhem in the world of professional killers. Problem. Upstart assassin can't even fulfill a contract to rid a restaurant of roaches, let alone kill some of the most guarded men in the world. ---  --- The story of Bob Dillon's flirtation with contract killers is a page-turner. Not really out of suspense, because you can't imagine that Fitzhugh would subject his characters to anything other than a fairy-tale ending, but out of unabated curiosity. You want to know how in the heck Dillon and his cohorts will survive to breed another strain of hybrid bug-eating bugs. Of course Fitzhugh answers with simple and hilarious solutions which are, towards the end of the book, more and more absurd and predictable. ---  --- Overall, I'm slightly embarrassed that I like this book as much as do. Nonetheless, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy and humorous read	pos
This is an awesome EP Slayer owns all even when the production isn't that great. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs, Tom Araya's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and Dave Lombardo's drums are fast as well. This EP is Slayer at their prime and even if it's only four songs it's well worth the price. Below are my views on each song. ---  --- Chemical Warfare 100000000000001/10, Yes it is that awesome, this is a legendary Slayer song and a fan favorite. If you're gonna buy this for one song this is it, the lyrics are great and I love the riffs in this track. ---  --- Captor Of Sin 10/10, The opening of the song is great. The song is really good too. My second favorite on this EP as well. ---  --- Haunting the Chapel 7/10, I didn't really care for this song much, it's good but not mind blowing. ---  --- Aggressive Perfector 10/10, Slayer's first song ever, the opening sorta reminds me of Metallica's "Hit The Lights" but the song is very different though. A part of this song sonds like the guitars are making video game like noises. The vocals are also a little different from other releases but it's still awesome.  ---  --- Overall this EP was a great follow up to their debut. It also led to what the band would later become, thrash legends. A must have for fans and general metal fans alike. Highly reccomended	pos

The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed. ---  --- I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like. ---  --- However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether.  ---  --- The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two). ---  --- The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes.  ---  --- Live and learn, I guess.	neg
5 stars to the film itself! Here's a painful study of a woman's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate, uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of  industrial waste. The character study is not unlike claustrophobic  Polanski's Repulsion but dwells on Vitti's being consumed by her external  surroundings as opposed to Deneuve's intensive plunge to schizophrenia. The  pace and landscape is virtual Antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who  are not familiar with the director's works. One of his greatest works  (L'Avventura remains his best to me). The only problem is the DVD transfer.  I've seen the VHS and it has a consistent hue of orange. The DVD, although  sharper and clearer, fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds  and oranges in long shots. For a film that essentially deals with color (it  was Antonioni's first color feature), the transfer was rather clumsy and  careless. The sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Why didn't Criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film	pos
I purchased this toy for my 3yr old in December last year. He has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find ANY products (discs, carrying case etc) for the videonow. I have called the company several times. Everything is always unavailable and I do check on a regular basis. My son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it. It was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired. If you make a product make sure that there are enough discs. It is simply a waste of money and time. I cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week. I hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy	neg
I believe the heart shaped locket is a one-of-a-kind thing.  It is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large.  The silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures.  Due to the size of the locket, a dainty, smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket.  Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase.  The pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection. --- Good gift. --- Sincerely, --- The guy who usually blows it on the Valentine's Day gift.	pos

Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done. ---  --- John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad. ---  --- Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules	neg

Don't waste your time or money with this DVD.  The best part of the DVD is probably the Trailers and most of those are Garbage also.  My DVD came loose in the package and scratched, too bad it didn't do any damage to ruin the Movie.  I couldn't wait until the Movie was over, I would have stopped it earlier, but wanted to see if any damage was done.  You'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier.  The last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off.  Don't waste your money, spend it on the cheap $5-6 horror DVD's, because at least those can be somewhat entertaining	neg

I have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side.  The problem with most conditioners I've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it, they are very heavy and weigh my hair down.

This app is just horrendous. It is literally NOTHING more than a moving map; I'm serious. There are NO features at all. To make things worse, when zoomed out, the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you've never heard of, leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found. Also, at these zoom levels, most roads, streets and highways are not visible, making navigation impossible. This app does not even come close to qualifying as a GPS nav system. Even as a 'moving map' it's pretty well useless unless you're zoomed into about 300 yards. Even though this app was a freebie included with Trips and Streets 2005 (which is a VERY nice, capable app.), it's still maddening that Microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released. If it were possible to give this program negative stars AND charge Microsoft with a crime, I'd do it in a heartbeat	neg

It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer. It does its job pretty nicely. The dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world. A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight. The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage. It is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment	pos

This mobile is amazing. From the time she was 6 weeks old, my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music.

I knew a man who once wore this classic cologne, and always smelled so good.  I bought it for my hubby this Christmas and instantly remembered why I loved that smell so much.  It is a classic frangrance, not stinky or overpowering - but fresh.  There are other Vetiver cologne's out there, but they smell NOTHING like the Guerlain from France.

If you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet, this definitely is the product for you. Though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta, it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie, low-carb meal. Be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce, otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of Atkins, South Beach, etc.	pos

I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!	pos
Let me be honest here...I'm not a big fan of either Nicole Kidman or Tom Cruise.  However, this movie is wonderful.  Great story, great characters.  The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is the ending; I think it could have been better.  Great movie overall	pos

If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.	neg

I think it is a great movie. I bought it for my grandson he loved it	pos
god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.           	neg

An anti-Catholic newspaper in a Catholic town (this peculiar quality of the paper existed long before the priest-child sex abuse scandal in the area). Whether you are a Catholic or not the paper's anti-Catholic bias makes one wonder why it has such an ax to grind and wonder too if the paper does not hold other prejudices.  Its "factual reporting" often times  reads more like editorials. It has elitist pretensions without the quality to back them up. --- I live in the Boston area and am exasperated with the Globe.

I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.

I have used many, many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and Kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement. I am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades. Leaves my skin beautifully soft, super smooth and all without added perfume (who's going to smell your face?) and additives. I have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate, but I much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and doesn't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation. Isn't that the whole premise and purpose of Kinerase anyway? Great stuff	pos

I got this toy when my baby was 7 months old, and he's now 8 1/2 months old.  We've used it for lots of local driving and a roundtrip from Los Angeles to Phoenix (7+ hours each way).  It doesn't work miracles, but it does definitely help calm and distract my baby when he starts to fuss, about 70%-80% of the time.  And I think it's more effective now than it was when we first got it, maybe because the baby has started to look forward to it. It might help that I *only* use it when he starts to fuss.  ---  --- I haven't had any problems with the toy working, and the volume dial is a nice feature. It does have its shortcomings, though, like some of the other reviewers pointed out: It only stays on for about 15 minutes (presumably to save batteries) so pretty much every time I put the baby in his carseat, I push the button to turn it on, just in case we need it during the drive.  It sometimes moves out of place which can affect being able to see the baby in the mirror, but it still works to distract him.  It plays 5 or 6 songs in random order, but they are all extremely short, so it ends up being very repetitive.   ---  --- Overall, I think it's a useful tool for calming the baby during car trips, and when it doesn't work it's generally because my baby is so tired or hungry that I don't think anything would really help except getting him out of the car.  And even though the repetitive songs can get annoying, it's far better than hearing a baby screaming while everyone is trapped in the car together	pos
We haven't yet put the bed together so it might be great but I gave it 2 stars because it should arrive intact but it didn't!  This was a common complaint in reviews.

Children of the Corn II~ Terence Knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage. The special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst. The acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production. The gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to Holly Upstairs acting school to write such junk. And to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me.	neg

I work for an University and my contract was due 2 months ago.  I decided to get this phone because my PDA was already old and I needed something that would be efficient.  I got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and I just have good things to say about it.  First, it is not as heavy as the last model (650) and also looks really cool.  Second, the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out.  The phone is Microsoft OS based (I used a palm device before) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue.  The battery works really well and, in spite of other reviews, the life have been pretty great, even when compared with my last phone (a motorola). ---  --- In general, I thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when Cingular sells it for way more money than Amazon.  I'll definetively will buy from this website again	pos
I bought myself this book light after giving someone a $5 "robotic" book light from Walgreens. When she used hers it lit up the room.

I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.

Dare I need tell you how greatly this softcore, action thriller sucks?  Ok.  You might think there are two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and Hilariously bad acting.  Well, there is nudity, but not as much as you think.  If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc., but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene.  Her "acting" is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her TV show.  she at least doesn't seem stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no idea!  There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies.  The movie only still exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make "To the Limit" more than a free rental, if that. I should mention that this is a review for the R rated version.  I don't know if there is an unrated version, but it would have to be better than this.  For more nudity, bad acting, and a less coherent Anna, go rent "Skyscraper"	neg

For years I used Rat distortion boxes for guitar and for bass. Now I play bass a lot more in bands, and find the Rat sound to be weak and one dimensional. I sold off my rat and tried out a number of other distortion boxes at a local shop and settled on the Big Muff Pi. This thing is rich. The complexity of the distortion is incredible compared to what you get with most other pedals--must be the brilliant Russian engineering behind it. It has three knobs: Volume, Sustain, and Tone. The Volume is obvious, the sustain is really the distortion level. For the Bass, I run the sustain very low, and the volume higher and get a great mix of clean and distorted tone. Sometimes I run the sustain knob turned all the way off and this thing still drives the sound nicely. Too much distortion on the bass and you loose your ability to cut through the rest of the band in my opinion. The Tone knob adjusts the center frequency of the distortion. I run mine way over to the left and distort the low end around 200-400 kHz. You can crank it around and get anything from a low grumbly distortion tall the way to a really tinny irritating heavy metal sound. This thing is versatile, and no matter how you like your settings, the distortion it produces is rich in harmonic overtones, multi-dimensional, and unlike any other boxes I've tried. Highly recommended. --- My only complaint is that this box is designed to work only on battery power--no AC adapter at all. Fortunately now there's an adapter from One-Spot that can be connected to a battery lead and then to an AC adapter. Hopefully Amazon will start carrying that soon.	pos
I have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. Maybe so but, it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds! Those "in between stages" kids who want to have a small table of their own but, need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. My son (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table. It is very sturdy! The small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time. The surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures. The unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space. My son had outgrown 2 "child size" table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for "Kids" and it has been a big hit at our home. Guess who's getting the matching Lifestyle kitchen for Christmas	pos
Do not believe the manufactures claims that you don't need a jacket if you have this bunting. --- We had a 7am Enfant bunting for our daughter for her first winter and loved it.  It had a hood (that could be unzipped) and completely covered her up and kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing. Now she has outgrown it and I bought one of these as a replacement. --- There is no way by any stretch of anyones imagination that you can use this bunting without needing a coat and hat as well.  The zip only zips to about half way up the chest of my one year old.  Yes you could pull up the flap to cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there is no way to keep it up! --- It did keep her just about warm enough with a coat, hat and mittens at a temp of 35F, but I want something that you can use without a coat. ---  --- After much research I am returning this (after a single outing) and getting a Little Kazook instead (which zips all the way up and has a hood)	neg
I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock!

I bought this for my grand-daughter, and here is my daughter's reviews of how this product is working (or not)  "Hmmmmm.... she LOVES the music more than the potty itself.  We listen and dance to the "potty" song everyday- but there has been little progress with the actual potty.  I think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet.  Otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat.  I think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better. Or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet, so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks.  Thanks, anyway."   I don't find this very encouraging, so I wish I had purchased something else.	neg

My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the "philosophy" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places. ---  --- All in all, I found it pretty vapid, painfully slow, and incredibly frustrating, because there is a good movie in here SOMEWHERE, if only the script had gone to someone else to make. ---  --- On a side note, Toby Maguire shows up for a little while as a stoned out of his mind loser, which was a bit of a trip given where his career eventually went	neg

Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke.  Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place.  We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use.

I was very disappointed in the taste of this item.  Not at all what I expected from Splenda.  It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.

Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too	neg
Bought this to use with my Weber Smokey Mountain.  I almost bought a Sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier.  This rack is solid and built with Weber quality. ---  --- The one reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the Sunbeam rack has skewers for potatoes and I would really like to see that on this rack.   ---  --- If the ribs are too big, I just wrap them around the wrap quite easily	pos
I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in  nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed	neg
I always liked the way my hair looks after a swim in the ocean and drying in the sea breeze. Unfortunately I couldn't do that every day but now I can get the look with Fekkai's Wave Creating Spray. The underneath part of my hair has some natural curl and waves. I spray it on damp hair, scrunch and air dry and although it doesn't dry in a toussle of Renaisannce waves and perfect (bong!) ringlets, it really amps up the curls and waves and gives me that beachy look. There' not a crunch factor either although if you keep spraying it on dry brushed out hair the hair can tend to get dryed out. It does add spring and holds well. I don't know how it would work on very straight hair since the top part of my hair doesn't want to respond much. But it works nicely on enhancing what Mother Nature gave you.	pos
I'm writing this reveiw on the company, Discount Ramps, rather than the ramps themselves. They charged my credit card immediately upon ordering, then 6 weeks later when I inquired about where these ramps were, they told me the manufacturer hadn't received the metal to build them yet, and the build time is 4-6 weeks. Just be careful, people	neg
After 2 tries finally got it; my wife ordered it for me(to go w/matching hammock) and after a month Amazon had to credit her cc because UPS sent it back due to damage. I order it and get in 2 weeks.It's easy to assemble/disassemble. If you buy it go out and get 2"S" hooks mine were missing(seems other reviewers had same issue). I did call their 800# and was happily accomodated by the pleasant operator who apologized and is sending out the hooks. I still give it high ratings based on easy assemble. I can't wait for my hooks--going out to see if I can find some today so I can enjoy it w/our 16mth old son	pos
I have been using FrontPage 2003 and decided that Web Expression Web was the next stage in my website building hobby.  It was easy to install, and I can still use FrontPage 2003 on my existing websites. No need for FrontPage extensions which will be a plus on one of the server hosts I use.  Also bought "Using Microsoft Expression Web" by Jim Cheshire. An excellent book.  Still have much to learn, but looks like fun	pos
I bought the chair for my mother. She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it. She loved it. It looks very nice, the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be, which is a good thing. The only problem I have is that every time she uses it, one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose. She is very disappointed with that because she's afraid to use it now. I'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem, but it something that needs to be taken care of. Aside from that, It took a very long time for the item to come in and I'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it, and now she can't really even use it!	neg
This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging..	pos
Great product, the girls had a blast with it.  Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair.  Great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled!  Although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair.  Not all the time though.  Still a fabulous product.  Would highly recommend it.  My niece wishes it came with more gems	pos

Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter .	neg
This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else	pos
This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a "feminist wonderland," but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: "Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother." Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians.	neg

I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.	neg
My criteria for my new printer purchase was: --- 1. 11x17 --- 2. individual inks --- 3. reliable printer company --- 4. easy installation/good customer service --- 5. price (this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice) ---  --- So far for my needs this has been a great printer so far.  It does great quality prints for photos, school projects and more.  I wanted to have more versatility to make posters, labels, photos, etc...  My last HP wide format printer (1200c) lasted for over 5 years and I took it everywhere.  I have only had this for a few motnhs but it hasn't been a disappointment yet	pos
I'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years. I, for one, still get something out of  the writing.

...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas."Horror-and-brutality technology" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved	neg
Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter? ---  --- The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul." Well, not exactly. ---  --- For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us. ---  --- It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it. ---  --- Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M. Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter Brook version in 1963	neg
My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with.

This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story	neg
I gave one to my nephew for Christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and I now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband.  ---  --- The projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than I thought it would be.  ---  --- To be honest I have to mention the drawback - the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day.  --- Until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size CD/alarm clock, we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature. ---  --- Even with the drawback mentioned, we all love the clock. My nephew loves being able to see what time it is without putting on his glasses	pos
The best part about my ijoy 130 is the price I paid.  Day after Xmas Linens and Things had only the floor model left.  Got 20% off of that plus signed up for the credit card to get another 10% off.  30% off made the chair $500 instead of $700.  I am in it as I write this!!!  Very nice and relaxing.  Sometimes the "percussion" setting is a little too hard in some spots but otherwise it's great.  I would agree that I wish it went a little further up the neck.  I just sit a little lower in the chair for it.  Not sure if it's worth $700 just because that's alot of money but I've got no problem with $500.  I think my wife and I will get alot of use out of it	pos
I bought this unit two months ago and since that time I have used it sparingly. I went to turn it on today and it was dead. So I went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one.

This book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all. You could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did. Book doesnt SHOW you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them. It also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor didn't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses. It is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used.	neg
For its size and price, this little light can't be beat. Very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors.

This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	pos
I used a Linksys Media Center Extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater. This product completley replaced the need for the Extender, was extremely easy to setup(WEP enabled) and works flawlessly.

Setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code. Well done Microsoft! --- Tom - Las Vega	pos

I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required	pos

I have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere. But I did want to say to potential readers that the Peggy Antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women's movement, that as such it fills a long-felt-want, and that it is to be recommended to those new to, unfamiliar with, or who feel they should be allied with, the women's movement. It would - it will - make an excellent text for those doing women's studies, as to those doing social movement studies, whether globally or more locally.  ---  --- Summarising, Antrobus shows the women's movement as political, as recognising women's relationship to social conditions, as processal, as posed against patriarchal privilege, as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation, marginalisation, isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation. ---  --- One complaint, but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone. This is the avoidance of the word `capitalism' - even by feminists who are or were once socialists. Capitalism does not even get an index reference in Antrobus. Capitalists, mostly after all male, white and patriarchal, call it capitalism, and are proud of it. So why cannot it not be so named by feminists, who could and surely should condemn it?  This cannot be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political-economic determinism of patriarchal socialists. So it has to be due to either a desire to be salonfähig (acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking, to the funders they are dependent upon), or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder, gentler global capitalism, a global neo-Keynesian order - for which no convincing feminist case has been made. Pity	pos
Did we need a Gore Vidal reader? The author is something of a long-winded blowhard, commenting at length (and I mean LENGTH) on every topic imaginable. In that respect he is America's Voltaire, creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics, the arts, and religion and morals. It's hard to say where Vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism, as he is not a conventional leftist. Because of his iconoclasm, this collection can only inform the reader about Gore Vidal, not his times nor any intellectual or political movement. All that said, Vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit. This book is much too much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter collections instead -- but for a Vidal fan (or, say, a reader of "The Nation") this book is worth the time commitment	pos
Okay, I'll have to start by saying that I don't play many Role-Playing computer games. I'm a fan of the genre, but I tend to play strategy/command-and-conquer style games.  ---  --- So, when I picked this one up, I didn't have a lot to compare my experience to.  ---  --- I was immediately sucked into the game, and the controls WERE NOT hard to learn, despite what another review said. Character progression is cool, giving a fair bit of control over how you develop both skillwise and alignmentwise (do you want to be good or evil? It's your choice and effects how the game plays out).  ---  --- The optional quests and main story quests are all cool, but I have to warn you all: the final battle is WAY TOO EASY. I beat the whole game without maxing most of skills, without having most of the really cool legendary weapons, and without doing a lot of side quests. But you can continue in the game world after it ends: just let the credits roll for aprox. 10 minutes. Though, there are no new quests, you can run around and tie up loose ends, like opening Demon Doors and Silver Key Chests.	pos

I came across "Olive" when I was in London this past May (2005).  It was a free supplement to that month's issue of "BBC Good Homes", so I wasn't expecting much originally.  Am I ever glad I didn't just toss it in the bin as I would normally do! ---  --- "Olive" is devoted to cooking that is, as my title suggests, simple, elegant and healthy.  Great editorial photography makes that food look great, and all its' recipes use readily available ingredients.  Each recipe is short, telling you what you need and how to prepare it, and not much more.  Sidebars or runners at the bottom of the page contain info related to the recipes, such as how to cook the perfect steak (i.e., "bring the steak to room temperature; use a very hot pan" and "oil the meat not the pan").  Under the section "Fast Food", one of these recipes was for Mini Wellingtons, has only 5 ingredients and is ready in 30 minutes.  Another section details how to make a signature Nobu (the famed sushi restaurant in NYC & London) dish, Cod with Miso, and the recipe isn't at all intimidating (although obtaining some of this dish's ingredients might be difficult unless you have access to an Asian market or similar online site).  GI Diet followers can also benefit from "Olive" as nearly all the recipes contain GI-related nutritional information.  Chef Gordon Ramsay also edits a column and shares his favorite tips and recipes. ---  --- The only reason I give "Olive" 4 stars instead of 5 is because many recipes contain both metric and imperial measures.  However, conversion info for the metric measures is easily available online.  "Olive" also uses British stove/oven indications, such as "heat the oven too 200C/fan 180/Gas 6" but I was easily able to convert these to Fahrenheit.   ---  --- So why subscribe to "Olive" instead of an American cooking magazine?  If you are like me, American Cooking magazines can be frustrating, in that recipes are often (and unneccessarily, IMO) complicated, and better suited to those who cook for the purpose of entertaining large groups of people.  Many healthy cooking magazines don't contain GI Index info, and fail to present it in an easily understood way.  Many cooking magazines 'on this side of the pond' also are chock-full of ads, and you have to get through them before you can get to the recipes or information that prompted you to buy the mag in the first place.  "Olive" is clean, uncluttered, and appeallingly presented.  What's not to like?	pos

Not your typical thick, floral-smelling perfume, this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises--like lemon juice mixed with sugar.  It's a seasonal perfume (I can't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter).  It smells very crisp, fresh, and clean, which I enjoy a lot, but I imagine others would not; the same things I like about this perfume, could smell like a cleaning product to others.  Go to your fridge.  Get a lemmon, squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar.  If you enjoy the smell you get, buy this perfume--I highly recommend it.  If not, stick to something more traditional and vanilla/floral like Ana Sui's "Dolly Girl"	pos
Dr. Amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family.  The stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome. Understanding the root causes, particularly the genetic predisposition within families, is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems.  These problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse:  they do not deal with the biological root causes.  Once those are dealt with, the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life.  However, without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions, one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch.  Take my advice.  If the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar, get help as recommended.  You will become a new person, the one you were created to be.  And that is a wonderful thing	pos
I purchased the Murad Acne Complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  I was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  Proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems I grow an immunity to it. ---  --- I paid to have the Murad Acne Complex expedited to me because I was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  I read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a "purging" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  Imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  Imagine the most painful breakouts.  That was my personal "purging" process.  It was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  My husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  I'm STILL using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, I'm basically back where I was when I started.   ---  --- I give up.  But I'm not giving up any more money to Murad	neg

I'm a fanatic for gummy candy, especially the sour kind. But most sour gummy worms look and taste like a chemistry experiment, and most apple and (especially) apricot fruit(ish) rings taste artificial too. Haribo does a much better job; their pink grapefuit was my favorite gummy until I discovered these apple ones. They taste natural, real healthy apple flavor, less stridently sour than grapefruit. Now it's a tie for top place: apple and grapefruit. When I can't decide, I eat 'em both together. My dentist taught me that trick, believe it or not. I sometimes wonder whose side she's on...	pos
When I used lighter, less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice.  If my toe caught the mat, the edge would flip over and require adjustment.  Also, they did not cushion very well.  In addition, lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced.  When doing poses like the side-arm balance, my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and I would fall out of the pose. ---  --- With the extra-long manduka mat, none of these issues is a problem.  The mat is solid and dense, and stays put on the floor no matter what I do.  It cushions really well, but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat (not mushy).  I beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great.  Durability is outstanding, and they show no signs of wearing out.  Ever.  The extra length allows me to move with confidence, knowing I won't run out of room or slip off the mat.  An additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat, so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice.  In other words, you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer.  The surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga, and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway.  No complaints about stickiness. ---  --- As for weight, it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra-long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around.  It ain't heavy, it's the best yoga mat I've ever seen.	pos

Worst than Dave, I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water, couldn't even tell the time.

I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and recently wanted to get my Son a guitar for his birthday. The look of the guitar is nice and the sound is decent. For 50.00, the guitar is a solid value. the overall sound of the guitar is some where between ukulele and a full size guitar	pos
In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent. ---  --- I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems	neg

If you want to read a book that's exciting, happy, and mind-blowing you should read Small Steps. From the author that brought you Holes, Louis Sachar, is at his best. This book is sort like a sequel to Holes. The main character, Armpit, is stuck in a situation which he can not handle. He is in the heat in Austin, Texas and I think it is making him do crazy illegal things. At first he did not know what he was doing was wrong, but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail. I think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above. Both boys and girls would enjoy this book. I think they should make a movie out of the book; it would get outstanding remarks. This is one out of few books that I could read over and over again. --- 	pos

I was blown away by the wonderful acting of Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi who played the retarded young adults. This was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability. Disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else. It was wonderful to see the love "Carla"'s siblings and parents had for her. There were 2 reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars. One was that Diane Keaton's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying. Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't love this film was because Hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good. Sorry, Hollywood, but there will always be those of us who still believe God's word to be true. Being a right wing nut job isn't considered normal or ok in the bible. God never created it. Look it up. You are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle.  	pos

I thought this movie was great!  It's definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie-goer.  It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival the masterpiece that is "Heathers").  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years to come.  After seeing "Party Girl" I fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I have a sick sense of humor. Everyone I know absolutely loved this move (including my MOM!) In any event, this is a definite must-see for any fan of Parker Posey and dark comedy.  Excellent	pos
I'm cursed with sensitive skin and a tough beard.  I'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated, so I have to carefully prep for shaving.  After years of trial and error, I've finally settled on a good shaving cream system: Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture Shave as a supplement.  For post-shave comfort and to prevent breakouts, I use a product like Clean&Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free moisturizing lotion.  However, the weak link up until now has been the actual shaver.  With the Gillette Fusion Power, I've finally found the right one. ---  --- I've used Gillette since they gave my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the Marines at the time).  They've gotten the job done, but a 3-blade system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type.  It doesn't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and neck, especially since I take forever to change blades.  I dreaded looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar).  Electric shavers don't work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I'd have a five-o'clock shadow around 2PM. ---  --- So, when I saw Gillette touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot.  I was initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues with electric shavers.  But the Fusion Power is the happy exception.  At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off of the end.  But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery in, I was set.  It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch).  And even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave with it.  The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning.  The five blades really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw line remain cut-free.  I also like the one-blade trimmer on top - very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils. ---  --- My only issue is the expense of the blades.  But I can make them last a lot longer than the old 3-blade razors while still getting a great shave.  And most importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do, it's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price.  The Gillette Fusion Power is the best shaver I've ever tried.  Highly recommended	pos

After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth. Bottom line: no complaints with it	pos
The reflector cover works great! It has consistently kept those tickets out of my mailbox. Its simplicity and ease of use is what made me interested in it in the first place, and now I can be sure that it is a 100% effective for all those red light cameras.

I have introduced many of my ELL, high school students to Lois Lowery and the depth of her characters. She is a brilliant writer and capable of inspiring fierce passion in her readers as they encounter shocking details of her utopian worlds.

Although the series is written for 6th graders and older, this book's simplicity, in its message, language and writing style will inspire no one.  I am sadly disappointed	neg
My old Audiovox phone, the 8500 was great. It fell in the toilet, though, and they didn't sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore, so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store. What a big mistake. It is awful with the poor sound quality, short battery life, horrible ringtones, and worst of all, I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail! Hello? and it has the most horrible graphics. Does anyone want to buy it, along with all the accessories?? It is barely used... ---  --- So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it, won it, and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610. I like the 8500s micro-size, simplicity, ringtones, animated graphics, etc. I must be careful not to lose it, or drop it in the toilet again, though. My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one, but I cannot get another replacement as I bought this one used. ---  --- The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not want to have a cell phone clued to my head. I use it to check my land line for messages and for brief calls. Do not buy the 8610, whatever you do	neg

Finally, fresh new characters which are adorable. I am a converted Kutoka buyer as I have now bought a 3rd item from them. I was so impressed with the Mia Reading and Mia Language that I wanted to try this multi-subject game for my twin girls in kindergarten. This game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving. We haven't played with the art part yet but I still think it's a great value for the other subjects. I'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties. Great product. Even my neighbours kids come over to play it!	pos
I have used Norton Virus Protection and Norton Internet Security for several years. I am currently running NIS 2006. My experience with these products has not been good but out of fear I just renewed my subscription. Since then I have had nothing but trouble with NIS. Since my renewal is within the grace period I decided to request a refund. I tried to do this on-line but found it an impossible waste of effort. Their web site and support are as useless as their product. From Norton Internet Security I clicked on support linked to their web site. Once there, I tried to apply for a refund but their system did not recognize my subscription renewal order number.  It did recognize my product order number for NIS 2006 but that is not refundable so no help there. I gave up on requesting a refund and decided to contact support. If you click on "contact us" There are 2 options, Telephone or Email. Telephone support was down because of an earthquake in Taiwan. I decided to try email. I clicked on email and got the following security alert:  --- There is a problem with this website's security certificate. --- The security certificate presented by this website has expired or is not yet valid. ---  --- Security certificate problems may indicate an attempt to fool you or intercept any data you send to the server.  --- We recommend that you close this webpage and do not continue to this website.  ---  Click here to close this webpage.  ---  Continue to this website (not recommended).  --- How ironic is that? I know I was on their site because I navigated there by clicking on support in NIS. You would think an internet security company could maintain their own security certificates. I'm not surprised though because everything Symantec does is designed to make you hate them. Their product is abysmal. It bogs my system down to a crawl, disrupts the performance of other applications and hogs system resources. If you put NIS on your computer you'd better get used to staring at the hourglass icon for long periods of time, Especially if you don't have tons of virtual memory and hard disk space available. Nortons CCapp retards start up forever and won't shut down when you want to log off. Recently I had to reinstall my windows xp operating system. After that I had major problems with NIS and had to uninstall it. It was then I realized how much better my system ran without it. I had already paid my renewal fee so I downloaded and reinstalled NIS and have had nothing but trouble since. I tried to leave feedback on Symantecs web site but typical of them, that does not work either. I wrote a long complaint, then clicked on submit. An error message came up saying to go back and correct the highlighted areas. When I clicked the back button all the text I had typed in was gone... just because I had failed to enter a subject line in the feedback report. I'll be damned if I was about to type all that information back in again. If you buy NIS you'd better hope it works the first time. If you think your going to get good support from Symantec or anything out of their website - think again. Oh, and BTW Beware, Symantec enrolls you for automatic renewal unless you go to their website and un-enroll. Once they have your money just try to get it back. Symantec sets up road blocks so you eventually just give up in frustration. This is how they make their money rather than by making a good product.	neg
Mixed low review-  The single biggest negative is the contrast/brightness level of the screen, which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions.  Unfortunately, that is a huge Achilles heal.  Otherwise, great electronics, features, and stylus operation.

Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.	pos
I don't see how they can compare these guys to The Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria. I can hear the prog elements but it's more of a Rush kind of prog rock,shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics. They are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band: the songs just aren't as epic as a TMV or a C&C song. I think reviewers liken Brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice. This is still an amazing album that is well worth your time. Go into it expecting Sparta rather than The Mars Volta and you won't be disappointed	pos

Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents. 	pos
I have used this pen and the Uni-Ball Signo 207 which seems to be it's competitor. This Energel is consistently smoother than the 207 on different paper surfaces at work.

I wanted this workout "game" to get back into shape after having a baby. It is a great workout including cardio, combat, isolation for abs, arms or legs, and mind and body including yoga and tai chi-type exercises. I love that it tells you what day to work out (and if you don't you fail that day!) and it increases the intensity of the workouts based on your previous performance. There are several different workouts in each segment so each workout is truely unique to help prevent burnout. Your workouts are assigned a letter grade based on your performance so it motivates me to get the allusive "A", which is hard to achieve (and it should be!). I am in week 8 of the 12 week program and I can definintely feel my muscles are more toned and firm after not working out for a year. I love that Nike helped produce the game. ---  --- I recommend this game to anyone; however, I have issues with the eyetoy camera. You would think I would get how the camera works after 8 weeks but I still have problems. Sometimes it indicates that I touched something I was nowhere near, and sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries for it to register that I touched something. You're still getting the workout, but I'm working towards getting a good letter grade. I want credit for what I'm doing right. The combat exercises are frustrating as I have a hard time believing I'm not punching hard enough and often receive a 0 score. I've started working out at night as the sunlight from the windows makes the camera less responsive. There have been a couple of times that I've walked to the left of the screen and my body triggered the "try again" button after a cardio workout...so I had to do the 10 minute workout again as history has shown when I try to exit out of it, the game fails me for the day for quitting. ---  --- All in all I'm happy with the workouts, but just know that the camera takes some getting used to. I hope others have better luck with it than I have. My husband does the 12 week program also and he's lost 10 pounds and I've lost 9	pos

Not being a fan of Westerns, I figured I would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on.  The opening scene completely sucked me in, though, and the movie took off from there.  The movie opens with Eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend's cattle.  Eastwood is left to die, only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail, where his story is verified by the judge, and Eastwood gets a job as a marshal.  His intention, of course, is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice.  The action in the movie consists of Eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt, all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare. ---  --- The movie even manages to touch on moral issues, when Eastwood wants clemency for an outlaw who helped him out, but is denied by the judge.  The judge himself grapples with issues of having the ultimate power of law over the territory, not knowing the "right" action, and wishing for statehood so that he wouldn't have the power of God over criminals. ---  --- The low point of the movie was Eastwood's romance with a beautiful, emotionally scarred blonde woman.  There is a painfully slow picnic and lovemaking scene, which drags on while the audience wants Eastwood to get back to his mission of rounding up outlaws.  Other than that, the movie is excellent.	pos
This game is tons of fun!  My husband, children (ages 6 and 7) and I have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game.  I definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game.  This game is also great for informal parties, as an ice breaker. 	pos

quiller's guide is the most systematic color text available. it combines a deep knowledge of traditional color theories with a huge amount of quiller's personal research into how paints actually mix as colors. central  to the book is quiller's color mixing wheel for watercolors, oils and  acrylics, probably the most accurate color wheel available in any published  work (though he has a revised color wheel, available separately). he  explores the monochrome, analogous, complementary and split complementary  color schemes through many demonstration paintings and detailed mixing  instructions. he emphasizes repeatedly the importance of a strong value  composition, and careful variations in color saturation, in building the  painting. an indispensible book	pos

I bought this after using other Murad products and loving them. I like this, but I wouldn't say I love it. First, it's a bit overpriced. I can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price. The toner itself is decent, but doesn't seem to clean as deeply as other toners. However, for those who find toners to be a bit harsh, this may be a good option. Non-drying and doesn't have that toner "burn".

R-Type, the legendary spaceship shooter, has come blasting back with her classic horizontally scrolling blueprint intact. Through waves of alien miscreants, you'll fight for each gained inch of space battlefield while collecting power-up items to enhance your ship's most primary weapon, the Mighty Orb Of Death. With R-Type's trademarked invincible sphere docked to the front or rear of the ship, MOOD can unleash deadly firestorms upon foes or be hurled forward to attack remotely and smash through most anything it comes in contact with. Though the gameplay is classic, the graphics have been updated to polygons (thereby qualifying for a Sony of America license) with lots of glowing lighting effects flowing gracefully over them. Most enemies are basic spaceships, but some levels have well-animated living creatures, like the badass water-worm things that slither though level 2. Sadly, even with crazy alien monsters, uber-weapons, 100+ ships and giant bosses, R-Type is a rather unexciting shooter. The MOOD is a shield against nearly all projectiles; so most levels are spent calmly avoiding being pinched between narrow passages and otherwise harmless enemy trains. Not a befitting task for "humankind's last hope.	pos

I'm a diehard Nikon fan.  My first Nikon was a gift from my father when I was 13.  Since then, photography has been a serious hobby, having had a few photos published and even spent time working in a photo lab while in college.  Having said that, and after reading several reviews about people having trouble focusing this camera, I absolutely agree with them.  Someone responded by saying those reviewers haven't read the manual.  Baloney.  I bought the Coolpix L1 to replace a 4 year old Coolpix 850.  The L1's camera's focus feature works fine in the daylight and works for s**t indoors, especially with the macro settings.  I've been patient and have given it three months.  I am fed up.

I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have.  When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens.  The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens.  And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have.  This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it.  I highly recommend it	pos

I have hard facial hairs (Thanks Dad!!) and after being Gilette user (last used Mac 3), I finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with Double Edge (DE) razor and blades. Merkur are the first ones I have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves, I am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones.

What a lifesaver this pillow has been for my 2 month old daughter.  When my son wants me to play a game, puzzle or play on the floor.  I just lay her on the pillow so she can watch us and feel apart of our play time.  I have also found it helpful when I fold laundry.  I can lay her down right beside me and she can watch what I am doing.  It props the baby's head up just enough--better than just laying flat on the floor. The lounger also cradles the baby.  I wish that I had found this when my son was a baby.  I recomend this lounger to every new mommy. 	pos
For the most part, these people whom the author thought are prominent Jews are either ignoramuses  as regards to Judaism and our heritage (especially the 2 Supreme Court Justices, who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek) or are not even Jewish at all. A waste of time	neg
This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light. I took a movie at my nephew's theater play and I am the contrasts and crispness of the picture are just perfect. The zoom is also very clear and crisp. Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake.  --- The only down point is that the still image mode is worthless, but if you need that you should buy the next level up which has a memory card slot. --- I highly recommend this camer	pos

Let's be honest...  a "kit lens" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality.  Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't! ---  --- I plan to use this lens as a knock around lens that allows me to get more familiar with my camera and run off some shots.  Personally (and this is a personal preference), I find that I tend to want to be closer to subjects anyway - with the 1.6x factor on the Rebel XT, I'm in great shape with some of my other lenses. ---  --- If you don't happen to already have a super wide lens in your arsenal, and you are getting a digital EOS with the 1.6x magnification factor, then buy this lens. ---  --- Please don't let some of the other "lens snobs" sway you - a few of which are actually "posers" that snap less than 500 pix per year and spend more time looking at the technical aspects of the picture instead of its true artistic value.  I can hear them now.. "it isn't contrasty enough", "the barrel distortion is horrible at the wide end", "pin cushion is significant"... ---  --- I say BAH!! ---  --- Are these statements true... sure they are... to a degree.  But let's remember that not everyone can afford to be as picky. ---  --- Buy the lens, load the camera with a fresh battery and a blank memory card and GET OUT THERE!!   ---  --- If you find yourself shooting at the wide end often, THEN sell/give this lens to a colleague and go in search of another (higher quality) lens... very little lost.   ---  --- Enjoy yourselves and take lots of pictures...  good luck	pos
It's always easy to criticize somebody's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars, but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable ACTRESSES and not STARS of the studio era. So it comes pretty natural to ask : Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook Margaret Sullavan? Was Grace Kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to stunning results? What was wrong with Mary Astor's acting  and what is right with Kim Novak's ?   --- Actress to me means Patricia Neal or Shelley Winters - Norma Shearer or Natalie Wood were stars....think about it	neg
Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.

Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story	neg

Ok Ive been Using Proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90% with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that. People often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic, so that was nice. ---  --- One night i styed up late and that Murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day. ---  --- Couple Of Days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. I knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again.  ---  --- I Have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha. My main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before	neg
my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid. there's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar. i really like that it's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar. it's great for those who don't want a flowery bath, but who can't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar. i wish i'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies. plus, this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb. really probably any bomb would do. good stuff	pos

Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.  ---        Would not say it's one of the very bests available in its category but it's interesting and fun. About graphics, though the details are not great, still I liked the 3-D view, specially the view through the eyes of the main character(Hero). ---        Story is so so. Dialogs are specially bad. But the fact that you have to follow certain clues and talk to people and find out useful information is good idea. A sort of combination of RPG and RTS. ---              I like the units and the way they fight. Also picking up artifacts or weapons is good.  ---         Overall it's a nice game. And the platinum edition is specially good as you get lots of hours of gameplay	pos

For kids who demand realism  these colored pencils, augmented by #B00006RVTB (multicultural set of EIGHT colored pencils), are  an adventure no matter what your age.  Even the littlest artists want to "get things right" - - though they often end up using some crazy chartreuse &/or purple to prove themselves in today's fantasy world. I can recommend three coloring books appropriate to use with this wonderful array of colors: "Ancient Native American" coloring book (# 0785820647); "Great African-Americans" coloring book (# 0486288781); "Great African-American Athletes" coloring book (# 048629319X). Try any & all of these from DOVER publications. ---  --- For the more sophisticated, the skintones of apricot, burnt sienna and mahogany are also available in Binney & Smith's sets of PAINTS. To have them so widely available proves the point that being politically correct is an O.K. (even profitable) idea.  It took years of agitating by kids to achieve this - - OR,  was it the United Methodist Women who spearheaded that campaign?  Reviewer mcHAIKU applauds all who worked to give companies the wake-up call. AND - - Be sure to read reviews by Smeequat "Ash" for knowledgeable & helpful 'weighing' of artists' supplies.	pos

This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of. I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon. Probably Ron Howard best film ever	pos
I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  --- And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. --- I would not suggest this book to anyone	neg

First off I need to tell you that I've carried a swiss knife since I was a kid. I have most of the styles. But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. For me since I don't fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. The "fish scaler" tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly, too much work. But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives. I've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights, pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think), to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. That's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd "parcel hook". This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives. The only useful task I've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when I snow shoe. Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? Please post it if you have	pos
The purpose of Nessus is to provide an Open Source Solution for network auditing on all Unix like systems.  This book not only details using Nessus but also comes with a CD containing the program, as well as Ethereal, Snort, and Newt (a port of the program to the Windows environment). ---  --- What is a network assessment?  At its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment, services, applications, and vulnerabilities on that system.  Basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external.  An internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the LAN.  Nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either, or both of them. ---  --- The authors do an excellent job of detailing installation, setup, and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report.  One of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system.  Some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows, default passwords, backdoors, information leaks, and denial of service. ---  --- The Nessus scripting language is covered in detail in Appendix A instead of the main portion of the book; a choice I appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section.  With Open Source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help.  So, the authors include information on how to get help via the Nessus User Community, mailing lists, and archives. ---  --- Nessus Network Auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality	pos

I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following. --- NWA - Straight Outta Compton --- Ice Cube - Amerikka's Most Wanted --- Dr Dre - The Chronic --- Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle --- Nas - Illmatic --- Tha Dogg Pound - Dogg Food --- Tupac - Me Against The World --- Tupac - All Eyez On me --- Tupac - Greatest Hits --- 50 Cent - Power Of The Dollar --- Biggie - Life After Death --- You get the picture	neg

The Miernik Dossier was shockingly good. Before this, I had never read anything by McCarry. In fact, I had never even heard the man's name. I was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. Now I am collecting everything by him. ---  --- The story follows an odd assortment of people, some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents, as they travel south through Europe into Africa. For the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if Miernik is who he says he is. The writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure. In that sense the Miernik Dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel, but yet it goes way beyond that. It is also a highly compelling character study, with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters. This makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are. ---  --- The Miernik Dossier is a highly entertaining read. True spy literature, in the vein of Ashenden, that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories, mysteries or simply great writing. I cannot wait to read this book again	pos

We loved the mini co sleeper!  Our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy.  I loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed.  I could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and I didnt even have to roll out of bed.  The mini co sleeper was so portable that I never even bought a pack n play.  We traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us.  I highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high.  I will use this for our next baby as well	pos
Abobe hits one out of the park. I find Adobe software clunky and hard to use. While I understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but Photoshop and InDesign have learning curves that are steeper than Mount Everest. I expected Lightroom to be the same - an excellent program with a huge learning curve. Well it is and it isn't which it why Lightroom is such a pleasure to use. I don't know what Adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses. For they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing. The program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable. ---  --- Lightroom is fabulous from look and feel to functionality. The strength is not only in the photo management portion of the program but also in the strong photo developing functions that can turn an OK photo into an amazing one. ---  --- If you do anything with photographs buy this program. You won't regret it	pos

Awful. I mean, really awful...and I liked "Self Portrait" because you knew Dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image. This album is just a disaster.

No way should children be playing this game.  It is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players.  The goals of harming people, picking up hookers, breaking the law, can be a blast as long as everyone knows it's just a fantasy.  Many people go into the details so I'll make this short.  Have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts.  But there's no way I would consider this game for anyone under 15, and then I would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy. 	pos

Of all the higher end mascaras I've tried, this one is by far the best.  Your lashes look longer and thicker with just ONE coat and looks like natural great lashes, not made up.

Although not a water proof mascara, it has incredible staying power, cleans off easily.  I LOVE this mascara, won't look elsewhere	pos
I bought the datapilot universal pro kit recently and it worked great! My screen broke on my nokia 6102, and i ended up buying a razor.

    I always hear these things, mainly of the point that it's unrealistic, noone uses teamwork, people are too preoccupied with their stats, etc, etc.  THAT may be true on many public servers, though there are quite a few that aren't filled with morons, and actually have people who play in a teamlike fashion, and complete their objective over killing off the enemy in the time given.  I am one of those people who actually go for the objective.  And actually, i am an admin at a server, and if a terrorist is last, and  is camping out the round, then i will slay him and warn him to stay on task.   ---    Onto another point- many people claim this to be so unrealistic, it may be true on points like the M249 being a slow shooter, very cumbersome, and has too good aim for standing up, and the fact that you die from 2 shots in the toe with the AWP- those are all unrealistic points, BUT if you think about it, how much fun would it be to have to unload 5 clips and a half to killt he enemy? *COUGH HALO COUGH* yes, i just insulted halo, because the enemies are too damn strong, it drives me crazy, along with the multiplayer being so annoying that you shoot the enemy with 3 shots from a sniper to kill... ---    And my final point is that there are people who aren't just preoccupied with their stats, there are servers dedicated to having fun- Yes, fun, on a counterstrike.  They will have a whole slew of crazy maps, ways to make it even more insane, and things such as that.  If you are interested in that try custom map servers. ---  ---   ALL-IN-ALL ---     This game is at a peak of perfection- not even mentioning the huge amounts of customization involved in this game, from weapons to player models	pos

I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT	neg

No one questions Lyrics Born's talent, which can be matched by few. His breakneck delivery will make you swear they sped him up in the studio, except then if you go see him do it live (recommended: he is a charismatic performer) you realize they didn't. ---  --- The problem with this release is not, therefore, Lyrics Born himself. It's just that there's not enough interesting things happening around him. There are handful of standout songs on this record, but there is no excuse for it running as many tracks as it does. The skits remind me why I sometimes think the whole idea of skits on CDs tired itself out in about 1997, if not earlier. Worse, the fillers sound similar to the hits but less memorable, making the whole album kind of drag, and the grooves, guitar licks and keys, all of which are good in small doses, become sort of flat after a time, especially when Joyo Velarde isn't singing backup vox. Surely a few of the songs could have become B-sides on the single, or something, instead of bloating the album itself. ---  --- Do That There, Rise and Shine, and One Session are my favorite tracks, the ones I would say go buy from the iTunes store or something right now. There's nothing wrong with the rest, I just don't find myself listening to them much. I like the concept of Later That Day but it should probably take less time out of the day to listen to	neg

I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it.

I f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline. Surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but I just cannot do it my self	neg
The pliers do the job & seem to be well made. My only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link. I guess if you remove the band from the watch, it would make it easier. In that case I recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface. BUT...this did do the job (even leaving the band on the watch). It comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out	pos

I love this mac & cheese.  It has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac (warm and gooey, orange cheese) but without that vague chemical aftertaste.  It tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just NO food in the fridge (you don't even need to add milk to this!).  My favorite comfort food when I'm sick	pos
This large version of Michael Myers is a lot beter than the McFarlane version released ever how many years ago. First the pose is better.Second NO BLOOD STAINS! Don't get me wrong, Michael Myers is a movie killer, but he never got bloody! That was my biggest complaint with the McFarlane version. He does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls, but if you remember from the movie, he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls. Finally third, and pretty cool, the sound effect is diffrent. Instead of Laurie Strode's whiny help me , you get the Halloween theme playing along with Michael's breathing. Remeber the end of the first movie, after Loomis shot him, but the body was missing, the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by Myers' breathing. If you got the NECA boxed set of Michael Myers and Loomis and liked it, get this! If you got the Mcfarlane version, get this! If you just like Halloween, get this! You won't be disappointed! Looks better in person than on the picture	pos

It wasnt all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo	neg

I've had subscriptions to just about every woman's magazine there is over the past 8 years, but the only one I always renew is "Glamour".  It's less "how-to-catch-a-man" oriented than "Cosmo", less pseudo-hipster than "Jane" and less serious than "Marie Claire".  While it's certainly no "Ms." magazine, it has a lot of women-positive messages every issue, articles that aren't as sensationalistic and fear-mongering than most found in women's magazines, and lots of fashion and beauty tips.  I feel that "Glamour" strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness--for those of you who like a side of third-wave feminism with your fashion, I highly recommend it. 	pos

I've been using the Sigma 10-20mm about twice or three times a month and I am very pleased. At such a wide angle, you will most like need to "de-fish" your final shot which can be remedied with CS2 or some other image processing software. At 10-20mm, the range is almost too wide, but after further usage, I got used to it. I'm very accustomed to a 12-24mm range and the 10-20mm took a lot of getting used to. The only drawbacks I know of in using this lens is that it is really prone to flare (despite the marketing by Sigma stating that the new lens coating diminishes flare) and the biggest aperture is f/4 which is variable pending on the focal length. It is not a fixed aperture lens. I also find that this lens is at it's sharpest around f/8-f/11 and I wouldn't go beyond that because I started noticing the degrading of image quality at very small apertures with this lens. But other than that, I've been pretty satisfied for the price I paid for this ultra wide angle lens. I still would prefer Nikon's 12-24mm, but I'm not willing to shell out that much money on a wide angle lens. Sigma's price for their 10-20mm is acceptable	pos

The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob, Battle for Bikini Bottom.  We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over.  Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar, we rented it.  It's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn't rotate the camera except for certain times.  The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in, it still wasn't close enough.  It's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly! Another aspect we didn't like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor.  Maybe we're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions.  It's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite. 	neg
My family has purchased this hot cocoa several times now and whenever we get close to running out we make sure to get more ASAP. We first got it at a local market but now get it through Amazon. We have had great experience with the vendor and the cocoa itself. It can be used for traditional hot choclate without being too sweet like the mass produced brands and makes an excellent mix with Coffee. We have even used it to make cold drinks, ice, milk and Azteca D'Oro is my son's favorite cold drink	pos

Isn't Barbie supposed to be pretty? She looks like an ugly prostitute, hands down. I wouldn't "wear that to a club" and neither would ANY of my friends. Her make up is gross, and especially the look on her face says, "Do me now." There's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy. You can't deny that she looks like a porn-star, which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in, but I guess we're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now	neg
I have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of Nikon's I use for wildlife spotting.    I have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do.   ---  --- I am a serious nature and wildlife photographer that has used high end Canon photography equipment for years.   When I saw a Image Stabilized binocular was available with "L" glass, (This is the symbol that Canon uses to identify their finest optics in camera lenses),  I bought them immediately.     ---  --- These binoculars are a little bit heavier than a non stabilized pair,  but the weight is easily compensated by the stabilizer.    Once you press the stabilizer button,  the scene will lock, and the effect is amazing.     I tested them by looking at a sign about 100 yards away.   With my normal hand shake I could not read the sign at that distance.    As soon I engaged the stabilizer,  the image locked into place and never once moved.    It performs as well as my camera lenses.   ---  --- As far as the optics,  they are, in my opinion second to none in the world.  The image is significantly brighter than any other set I have,  and the calrity and sharpness is incredible.   The night viewing capabilities are incredible.  ---  --- Finally, a huge plus is that these binoculars are completely fog and weather sealed.    Change amibient temps, use them in the rain, and the will not allow condensation to get into the unit.  A wonderful feature for those of us that use our equipment in other than nice weather. ---  ---  --- Things to be aware of include: ---  --- These are relatively large,  which suit a medium to large hand size.   If you have very small hands, your may not like the feel of the unit in your hands.  ---  --- Second, the lens caps do not perform well.   They simple do not stay on the unit.     Although for me this is not a serious issue, it is the one area that Canon could have done a much better job.   You can get around this issue by attaching a good uv filter to the lenses.  (You should probably do this anyway to protect the glass) ---  --- Finally,  the strap the the carry case comes with is poor.    It is too thin to be comfortably worn for extended use.   I would recommend you find a really comfortable aftermarket camera strap to use with these.    ---  --- SUMMARY:  ---  --- Outstanding performance and quality.    A little larger fell in your hands than some people may like,  but once you learn to use them, I do not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go!    I give the Canon L binoculars a 5 Star rating. 	pos
I got this for my 5 year old, who started kindergarten this fall, and she is in love with the whole school concept.  She loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset.

Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing	neg
Ms. Melua is from Georgia.  Her voice is quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl.  Neither has range or power; both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse.  Both have musical partners.  In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes songs.  Most of this album are her and/or his songs.  They are well written and well treated.  They are are a careful team abnd do not cut corners.  Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago. ---  --- The original sogs are interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition.  But my favorite cut is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole me..." it starts.  Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works it. ---  --- One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these defects.  My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has assembeled.  Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made	pos
The dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea.  The only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself.  I wish the case closed more tightly, it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily.  Overall tho, aside from the annoyance of the lid, for the price it was still worth purchasing because as I've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection.	neg

If you're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done, Nioxin System Scalp Therapy is the answer.

BACKGROUND: The 1976 cel animated real sequel to Frosty the Snowman, it is shorter than the original Frosty at half an hour format. Made 7 years after the original Frosty which was an hour long format. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr, who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well. Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (Played by Shelley Winters). While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, this time we have the voice talents of Andy Griffith. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular at the studio and had voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa in the original. Dennis Day voiced the Parson, and Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did in the original. The writer is Romeo Muller, just like the original and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. There are no original songs this time out, as Christmas standards are used instead. Oh, there is another film out there called "Frosty Returns" that is marketed as a sequel to the original Frosty, but it is made by another studio. It features the voices of Johnathon Winters and John Goodman, it's fun but not up to the quality of this show. ---  --- PLOT: Just like the song says, Frosty comes back again someday. Frosty returns to play with the children, but Jack Frost is envious of him. He tries to steal Frosty's magic hat. The children build Frosty a wife named Crystal according to magic instructions from Frosty. When Jack Frost finally gets Frosty, its his wife that must save him with love. They finally make friends and work together to have a long happy winter.  ---  --- Very well done by Rankin/Bass Studio. Their studio has brought us such memorable holiday classics such as Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, Mad Monster Party, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Mouse on the Mayflower, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, Jack Frost, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit, Flight of Dragons, the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, 95% of the ones we see every year. Their work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that have been released on DVD.	pos
I am a regular U.S. reader of other Future Publishing art titles, and was overjoyed to see the first title on the newsstand of this fantastic magazine. ---  --- ImagineFX explores the digital science fiction, fantasy and anime genres through letters, interviews, portfolio expositions and fantastic tutorials. All issues also include pull-out artwork by the featured artist, as well as a companion DVD featuring files for the tutorials, artwork and software. Within the magazines pages one will find a wide assortment of styles and artists, including everything from tutorials by noted conceptual artist Ryan Church to explorations of gothic art by several fantastic artists which all serve to expand your creativity and help you along your own creative path. ---  --- On the minus side, most of us U.S. readers will be put off by the per-issue pricetag. But for those living in the U.K. (lucky!) or those U.S. readers willing and able to part with the money, this magazine is not to be missed	pos

I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day	pos
Was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting, indepth coverage, etc.  Then, starting about 1-2 years ago, the magazine started to take a "left" tilt.  (I do not consider myself "right wing", am registered as an independant, but do like fair balanced coverage in my news)  Since the beginning of this decline, the Atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine.  The bias has also led, as it always does, to less in-depth reporting, since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent.	neg

I've been a fan of Carol Dweck's scholarly work for years. Her work on self-esteem, self-concept, and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools I've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children, as well as in their own self-awareness and lives. I'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone, rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of Dweck's research and ideas. I'm recommending this book to all of my graduate students (teachers and principals working with gifted learners), as well as to parents of high-ability children. ---  --- Dona Matthews, Ph.D., Director of the Hunter College Center for Gifted Studies and Education, City University of New York	pos
What a horrendous experiment in comedy...if you like Jerry Lewis, I guess you'll love this travesty of a film.  If you are a film snob, you will love it.

I can't put it any better than the others before me have.  I did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad I decided to spend a little bit more money for a TON more quality.  This is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than I will be (and I'm only 35).   ---  --- The other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set.  The prices vary wildly. ---  --- Yes, it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there.  However, the others are cheaper for a reason... they're junk.  You simply can't do better than this set	pos

Also, the 16oz bottle will last a very long time	pos
I bought this camera as something a bit more capable, but not as expensive as an SLR. With a zoom equivalent to a 300 mm lens on an SLR, I certainly saved myself a heap of money over buying an SLR setup with the same capacities.  ---  --- I use this camera mostly in manual. That was my aim in buying it - to get more proficient in using the manual settings. A few times I have switched it to auto, and haven't been all that impressed. The autofocus seems a little unpredictable, but there is a single press manual focus button on the left side, as well as a focusing ring, and these do me very well indeed. I don't think I would recommend this camera to someone who wanted to use it mostly as a point and shoot.  ---  --- It loses one star mostly because of its poor macro capability. For really really good closeups it just doesn't come close to my Konica Minolta DImage Z6.  ---  --- I was a bit lost without image stabilization at first. This camera compensates for not having this by jacking up the film speed when in auto, and if I want to use it in manual and handhold, of course I have to do the same. Since I use a tripod a lot, this is not too much of an issue for me. I've heard a lot of bad press on the graininess at higher ISO, but I have found them to be at least as good as film if not better.  ---  --- The colors are great. I love my range of menu options, though there is nothing too extraordinary about them. This camera has more buttons than some, but once I got used to them, they make my selections so much faster when I am shooting in changing light conditions.  ---  --- I like the fact I can use a cable release with this camera. I have used it for quite a bit of low light work, and the fact that I can dial it right down to a twenty second shutter speed or even to B is fantastic. ---  --- I've found it pretty hard to find image editing software to work directly with raw images from this camera.  ---  --- It's working really well for me as a prosumer camera. However, I still think that if I could go back, I might go for a Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP instead. Maybe. I would have to check that one out more thorougly first	pos
The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.

Blind Items has the same writing style as at least one of Rettenmund's other books (Boy Culture).  He goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs.

So this movie is made of 2 stories.  The first one is quick and involves Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin.  Both have their stories and I actually found Kaneshiro more interesting.  So this thing ends and the movie should have also.  It should have been a 30 minute movie.  So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs.  Wow, what a movie.  The only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day.  She was fun to watch but I still wish I wouldn't have seen this dumb movie.   	neg
Well. I was convinced the FX07 was a bad product after using it for 6 months. Like a lot of other reviews have pointed out, the noise level in low-light condition is annoying, and give you a watercolor-like effect. Some pictures I took during a visit to Monterey Bay Aquarium turned out completely dark (to prevent this beforehand, I even took photos of the same objects using several different settings, only to get the results of bad, worse, and worst). The picture quality is nowhere close to my old old old Sony cybershot T7. I was totally disappointed. If not for my T7 was broken, I wouldn't even wanna use this camera. Even re-sell it to other people, I would feel it's like a crime. ---  --- After revisiting this webpage and read more user reviews, I realized I must have got the defective item from Amazon. Well. What can I say? It's been 6 months.  ---  --- Bottom line: Just be careful when you received this item. Do some test shots. If anything looks suspicious, ask for a replacement. After all, all the high praise here can't be all wrong	neg

Intermezzo is, without question, my very favorite magazine. I think it's the best magazine on the market; most beautiful, most interesting, and has the best recipes. Have already made several recipes from the new issue and they are phenomenal, and pretty simple too.

I used to alternate subscribing to Bon Appetit and Gourmet but have let those lapse. Have given it as a gift to several friends who love it as well. Any time I have had a change of address or customer service question, I have been pleased and astonished with the personal and prompt attention of the staff, even once the publisher heself. I think Intermezzo is a small company putting out a world class publication. I do wish it came out more often though as I would love to see more of it.	pos

CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number. ---  --- i stayed with Corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches, bugs and the dreaded "odd-numbered" curse (if you tried version 5 or 7, you feel my pain). Adobe Photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... CorelPhotoPAINT just never quite "did it" for me. ---  --- Industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into Adobe Illustrator. Being already familiar with Adobe Photoshop's features, tools and "look and feel", Illustrator didn't present a huge, overbearing learning curve. In Illustrator, i found the same robust features as CorelDraw ... which wasn't what impressed me about Illustrator. Adobe's intuitive programs, and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... THAT is what won me over to Illustrator. Illustrator's ability to edit/create PDF's in their native format? WOW! Exporting LAYERED vector files to Photoshop ... with layers INTACT??? WOW!!! (i could go on) ---  --- Now, that being said ... there are STILL things that i prefer in CorelDRAW compared to Illustrator. The EXTRUDE function in corel is MUCH easier to utilize. The PowerClip function is more user friendly than Illustrator's "make clipping mask" function. The ability to customize/edit/add shortcut keys is an amazing feature. (again ... i could go on) ---  --- In regards to importing and exporting files from other applications, CorelDRAW wins, hands down. It boasts a ROBUST set of import and export filters, my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves DURING the import. This is a MUST HAVE if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack. If i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into Illustrator with fonts blown out ... i'd be independently wealthy. WHY Illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me. ---  --- So, to sum it up ... CorelDRAW is a great program ... but i can't imagine it being my ONLY vector drawing program. Just like in real life, you need a great team. This program, paired with Adobe Creative Suite, meets my needs perfectly.	pos

It might just be REALLY bad luck, but after three fossil watches (1 x blue, 2 x titanium), I've never managed to make them last more than two years each.

I purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer.  The document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that I simply had to re-type.  It would have taken longer to correct than to re-type.

In other words, they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it.  The program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else	neg

As Socrates once said "I drank what?" ---  --- Frank Bigelow (Edmond O'Brien, you may remember him as Winston Smith in `1984' 1956) realizes after he had a one night fling that he does not feel so good.

Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative) conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview of "Third Quest" Jesus scholarship I have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked, at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship	pos
This quote became my all-time favorite the first time I read it.  I was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry!

I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under $20.00.	pos
I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on.

From all the reviews I read, I expected certain pros and cons from this lens.  I was not disappointed. --- pros:  very sharp lens with very good colors --- cons:  vignetting at wide open, and a little too contrasty --- For myself, the pros outweighed the cons for the price.  It is ideal for the 1.6 multiplier cameras, where it becomes a 38mm lens	pos
His basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United States is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs. ---  --- I couldn't agree more with most of these points. As an American, I'm greatly ashamed of our collective ignorance. I hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country because I watch the news or can find Sumatra on a map. Also, the book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half measures in foreign interventions. Countless times, I believe America has done more harm than good by, if you will, talking the talk but not walking the walk. If we commit to something, we need to follow through. This is as true in Iraq today as it has been in the past. We've claimed to support democracy in Latin America, but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. We greatly prolonged and increased Vietnam's suffering without changing the end result at all. ---  --- With all this commonality, however, there are a few leaps of logic that Ferguson makes that I can't bring myself to agree with. Basically, he didn't sell me on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop the world. How are we supposed to know what is best for everyone? Won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even our most altruistic efforts? ---  --- When Ferguson hold's up the British Empire as a model of success, I can't help but notice that the best results came only to those places of British colonization, with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations there. And the two greatest examples of beneficial American imperialism - Japan and Germany - were already highly developed before World War II, so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder that we were able to help them return to such a state. ---  --- Even if the positive power of empire is conceded, there are important differences between the state of world during the British empire and the state of the world now. It's a concern of immunity from repercussions. In the golden age of imperialism, Europe was in a kind of splendid isolation from its empires. Not to say that there were no reprercussions, but, with the only modern navies in the world, Europe was immune to any very serious threats. On the other hand, in today's world, as an effect of globalization, power has become more decentralized in some respects. Think WMDs,terrorists, and foreign investments in the U.S. economy, for example. Can America as easily afford to make enemies in the developing world as the British could? ---  --- In the end "Colossus" didn't settle any agruments for me, but raised new and interesting questions. It is a book that makes you think, and that in and of itself is worth four stars.	pos

This is the best brand of slippers I have ever owned! I have a cute pink pair that I slip into the minute I get home. They have lasted for several years now, and they are still in good shape. ---  --- These slippers are so comfortable, and they stay on my feet without any effort. They are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm, and my feet never sweat in them, even without socks!  ---  --- This style runs large, and I wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers. After wearing them the first week, I noticed they got a little roomier, but they still stay on just fine. ---  --- They are my only pair of house shoes at the moment. I just ordered a new pair in a different style (in pink, of course), and I have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me. Try Dearfoams and your feet will thank you	pos

This is the Optimus Prime that should have been made 20 years age. It was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging.

I highly recommend the Raynox DCR 1540Pro Teleconverter for the Canon S2 instead of the Canon branded one.   Hoya makes a 67mm UV filter for this and both are available at Lensmate.com.   The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good.  Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore.    --- By the way, the function that the S2 provides for settings using the lens adaptors and teleconvertors are to adjust for the AutoFocus function of the camera and are necessary unless you wish to try to focus yourself using the manual focus which, in my mind, because of the LCD both in the screen as well as in the viewfinder with a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder, is iffy at best.   Trust the camera.....it really does an excellent job.   One final note, I would recommend using the Focus Bracketing option in lower light situations as the Auto Focus is weak in those situations.     	pos

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in.

I just got this from Khol's. They had it on sale for $11.99. When I saw it, there were plenty on the shelves. I was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape.  There was a try me sign on there. So in my boredom, while waiting for my ride, I read the directions on the back and actually tried it. It was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light'. ---  --- I'm glad I checked out the aisle. I've never seen anything so cool. ---  --- It's very simple to wind-up the flashlight. The ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily. It's not difficult to follow the instructions. Anyone could do it.  ---  --- The lightbulb is LED so according to my internet research LED: --- "LEDs have an extremely long life span, twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs. --- " ---  --- The design is actually very nice to the touch. It's padded with some nice rubber grip, so its not unpleasant to hold. It's not very heavy at all. It's about the size of a male's electric shaver. ---  --- I bought it at Khol's for more money than its listed here on Amazon. I got it today and I showed my younger siblings. They loved it, too. ---  --- Basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand. It's really simple to use and its a comfortable design. I plan on going back to get more tomorrow.) 	pos
I bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers.  Having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year, I decided to go with something tried and true.  And while you can't set it up to turn on by itself, I will never have to replace it again.  The color is beautiful.  It is a snap to clean up (just throw it in the dishwasher).  And, the coffee tastes so much better.  I now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful, robust coffee and no bitterness.  I guess this is one thing that modern technology can't top.  I will never go back to and electric coffee maker	pos

This seems like a really sturdy, lightweight stroller. I just wanted something simple and strong that can get us out of the house quickly--we live in a very hilly, sort of rustic area, so I needed something I could take my son to the park in without hauling out the big buggy. This is really light, and it folds and has a carrying strap in case the boy wants to walk a bit. (There is also a storage bag for travel.) ---   --- The tires have treads on them, so they can handle steep terrain, and they give a pretty smooth ride over bumps. The fabric is sort of a thick canvas-sy polyester--not removable, but it seems like it could easily be scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary. The seat also has some padding and back support (although, on the con side, it's probably not the coolest compared to mesh). The weight limit is given as 37 lbs, so my 19-month old still has plenty of room to grow--his shoulders are comfortable and his feet don't reach the footrest yet (he is 27 pounds and about 33 inches tall). On the plus side, it seems bigger than the Wrangler All-Weather umbrella stroller, plus it reclines a bit (you unzip/unbutton the sides to allow the fabric to unfold), unlike the Volo.  ---  --- The square canopy is maybe not the greatest (it only covers the face, and could actually sit a little higher I think)--but as for everyone complaining that it falls off, I have found that when you flip the canopy to the back, if you then detach the back flap from the seat, you can  attach the side flaps to that velcro on the back to keep it from sliding off.  ---  --- Some people have also mentioned kicking the wheels, but I'm 5'6" and haven't had any problems--I think it's a matter of not standing right on top of the thing since it's an umbrella stroller and doesn't have a superwide wheelbase.  ---  --- I would give it 4.5 stars I think, but am giving 5 because of the great price! I'm pretty happy with this--and my son is constantly trying to climb in, so he must like it too... I figure that with the money we saved, we can buy a nice Kettrike or some other form of transportation the boy can grow into.	pos
I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff. ---  --- I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally.	neg
Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves.  ---  --- The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great! ---  --- I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature. ---  --- Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal! ---  --- SMILE	pos
     I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it. ---      Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company, including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available. ---      I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV. ---      In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy	pos
Although my 3 1/2 yr old loves this belt, it barely fits him. It only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go. In fact, my 1 1/2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro. The smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear. Also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all, and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face. My son loves it for the brief time it sort-of fits him, but I am disappointed with the quality, and the size	neg

There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.   ---  --- I'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main problem with the film.  The production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image quality on the DVD could have been much better as well.  Also, the Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed with English.  This is, in the case of this film, not very well-done.  The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face or ethnicity in the least.  Everyone in the film winds up with an English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing. ---  --- Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda Jablonska).  Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect. ---  --- The problem I had was with one scene in particular.  Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police.  She bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence.  In the process of getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few places, and tears her clothing.  She goes to Moreau's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window.  When he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking what had happened.  He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash herself.  As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her, she steps into the bath.  Just before she pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.'  He shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy.  A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a full-frontal nude shot.  Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers, suggesting that she warm herself.  She climbs into the bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the room.  There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred.  He has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy.  ---  --- This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that, regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the first place, it could have been left out.  If the point was to show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways. ---  --- Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this from outside).  Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed natural for her to become upset over this.  As a result, however, the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour.  This, combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even more disquieting. ---  --- There are some viewers who might argue that, in Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the US.  In many instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with them.  There is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little bit of neurosis.  However, the sexual objectification of children is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out.  It worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers.  Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful?  ---  --- I'm glad I've seen the film -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen.  ---  --- The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out. ---  --- n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted this exact review.  I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has, for some reason, been removed from the site.  I've re-read what I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or offensive.  The issues I have with the film are discussed straightforwardly.  If anyone objects to anything I've written here, I'd like to know what it is. 	neg
To my knowlege, there simply isn't a better equipped camera for the professional investigator.  It's IR-sensitive mode (nightshot) is in B&W (rather than cheeseygreen), far superior quality-wise to anything Sony's got, and it's the only 3CCD that I know of with a low-light mode.  The image stabilization is exceptional and the image quality is production grade.  Time/Date stamps can be "burned in" so they xfer via firewire - again, the only camera I'm aware of with this feature.  The audio can be turned off which we know is a must.  And best yet, you can disable the sleepmode so it won't turn off eliminating missed money shots waiting for the camera to cycle back on.  It's built like a tank and feels substantial in the hand, but it's still lightweight thanks to an alloy frame.  Finally, it's totally silent even with the tape transport in full swing.   ---  --- The ONLY downside so far as I can tell is it's size - It's a big camera compared to the handicams I've had, and wouldn't be well suited for close-proximity work.  However, the black casing dosn't print/siloutte terribly, and the 16x optical lets you set back quite a bit. ---  --- Highly recommended! --- 	pos
"Cyrano" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.   ---  --- Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano.  He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac.  With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance. ---  --- The English translation was especially commissioned for this film.  It is undistinguished, prosy and dull.  It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore. ---  --- Get the Jose Ferrer version.  This one's a dog	neg

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.  ---  --- The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.  ---  --- I recently discovered Tazo Teas ad have been immersing myself in the mysterious experience with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried most of the flavors and have been impressed. I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.  ---  --- Caffeine Free. You can drink this as you type into the night...  ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.com	pos
This is a great puppet theater, sound stage, restaurant, play house, etc...  My daughter was 4 when she received this from Santa.  He only wished he had found it sooner!  My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with her younger sister.  Many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater.  We especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children.  All the others we researched were too small for our needs.  The colors are so vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company.  All the kids gravitate towards it	pos
I bought my genisis Silver A six years ago. Despite some abuse by me (not covering it when it is raining, ignoring grease fires while watching tv, not cleaning it regularly, not replacing the flavorizer bars) it still is going strong and continues to produces the most delicious burgers, steaks and grilled chicken ever. I'm really glad I invested in the weber and not in a cheaper brand. The size, for me is perfect. You can fit a lot of meat on this grill	pos
emotionally shattering true-life tale (well, sorta) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he (played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis. what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie (and it IS both, and splendid examples of each) instead resonates as a meditation on survival, betrayal, and accomodating and forgiving oneself. a great film, but only for mature audiences.	pos

I first read about this wonderful book on one of the services that provides reading guides for book clubs.  I was intrigued by the premise, and knew I had to buy it.  This is one book that did not let me down!  I was captivated from the moment I began.  I read in greed, hungering for the next diary entry.  I completed it much too quickly, and had to re-read some entries.  I found myself wondering about some of the women.  (Many are still on my mind.)  I am so pleased that book two is in the works.

This item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly.  Also it does not work well at all.  If you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least. Many times it stays flat and when it does "rise" it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs. I would have returned the item, but I left it for my mother when I had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time I returned my 30 day window was closed.  DO NOT BUY, you will regret it if you do. I won't even put this item in a yard sale, because I would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it. 	neg

I know I'm a little late, but what the heck? I felt like writing a review for this game. Final Fantasy X is just a fantastic game. Simple as that. Its extremely deep, has a fantastic story, great characters, great battle system, and it's the perfect length for a RPG (45-55 hours). Not everyone likes Tidus, be he honestly doesn't bother me, and I think he is a interesting character. The rest of the cast is well developed, and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe. The cast is very memorable, you'll remember them for years to come, and I think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is. Its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that Square is known for, so that doesn't disapoint. ---  --- The gameplay is extremely fun, and its actually one of my favorite battle systems. The battle system can make or break a RPG, and this one doesn't disappoint. Its fast paced, so it doesn't get bogged down by long battles. You can also swap characters mid battle, thats a awesome feature. The gameplay is also incredibly deep, I've heard of people literally pouring hundreds of hours into this game. So if thats your thing, I'm sure you've probably already played this game. If for some reason you have not played this game and your into RPG's, don't hesitate to pick this game up, its cheap now, and its one of the best and most balanced RPG's I've ever played	pos
This is one of the most beautiful looking barbies we have ever bought. It is also the worst doll to date! ---  --- The doll NEVER worked from day one. It's tail bent up and it made grinding noises and didn't move or swim - just laid there. All the reviews on this site (which seemed to have disappeared since I notified MGA - the toy maker) were correct - NOT ONE BUYER had a working doll!!! We bought this for my daughter, niece and friend - and NONE of the 3 worked. It's not hard to follow the directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem. ---  --- Also, the hair falls out and is EVERYWHERE in the bath water (pretty gross), and the bikini top is near impossible to get back on correctly! ---  --- Overall, the biggest disappointment in a toy so far	neg

Generally, my eyes glaze over as I reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious. Make Your Own Luck by Shapiro and Stevenson has broken the pattern. Written in punchy conversational style, the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision-making. The process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects, allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure. This sounds as if it could be tedious, but it's not. The authors know you are not sitting in a policy course. They know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet. The book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus. In managing investments, I'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors. The tools in Make Your Own Luck, such as the Prediction Map, are completely applicable to the inferential analysis I use in managing investments as well as life's major problems, such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party. This book is a good read. Shapiro and Stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Make Your Own Luck makes you laugh, makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot. 	pos

During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back. --- I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!! --- I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase	neg

I bought this scale for my wife (ya, I'm that sort of guy)! She's definitely not heavy, but 'concerned' and a follower of Weight Watchers. I was shocked to read various scale reviews prior to purchasing this one and find so many that did not weigh accurately! Well, this one was highly rated by most reviewers for accuracy & they are right. This scale is very accurate in determing a person's mass (sorry, I was a Physics major too) and confirmed at her Weight Watchers' weighings. As for it's accurate determination of "body fat" and "water", I can't say, but feel these are a bit gimicry anyway. ---  --- As for my wife, she loves the scale & me. Although, her love for me covers over many poorly chosen gifts, so I'm not absolutely sure about her love for the scale. However, I do know she uses it ever day and enjoys telling me of her victories	pos

I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.  ---  --- Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.  ---  ---  --- Cons: ---  --- In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well. ---  --- Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7). ---  --- The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.  ---  --- Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus. ---  --- The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.  ---  --- After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little. ---  --- Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance. ---  --- So would I recommend this camera: --- If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere	neg
You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals. Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel? There's no gold inside! So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables. If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie. Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference. ---  --- With analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).	neg
I found Cat Fancy Magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners.  I'm also very unimpressed with their Cat Channel online board they advertise in Cat Fancy and cannot recommend it to others.  They seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it.  Also Cat Fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine, but if you go onto Amazon, you can get a renewal rate of almost half the Cat Fancy renewal price.  So I have come to the conclusion that between the Cat Fancy magazine, their poor online Cat Channel board and the high renewal rate Cat Fancy charges, they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members. 	neg

I'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage.  Buying this for kids and all that.  Its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting, at least to me, but hopefully it is to kids.  However, they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult Clue, and not in a good way.  The "room" variable for example, drops out.  Its not relevant.  Its who ait the cake at what time with what drink.  It just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant.     ---  --- The idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler.  Well, the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place.  And the change sort of makes it more complex in a way.  You need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens.  Now the sheet does list the rooms, you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens.  But since the rooms are not otherwise relevant, its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens.   ---  --- The game is also incredibly cheaply constructed.  For example, the "die" does not have numbers on it, you have to put number stickers on it.  And the board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement.   ---  --- Anyway, not recommended	neg

I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use.  The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of.  Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use.  It was very unwieldy to travel with.  It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable.  Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke.  The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs.  I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average.  Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster. 	neg

They eventually acknowledged the Photo Frame appeared defective, When I asked to exchange the Photo Frame (taking advantage of the 90 day warranty advertised on their site), they told me to return it to the store it was purchased. ---  --- I do not consider this very good customer service; I would not recommend this product.	neg
Knitters take note:  I purchased what was titled as "Anna:Burda Knitting & Needlecrafts-English Ed".  What arrived was "Anna Needlework and Crafts," which contains very little knitting. ---  --- I should have looked at the photo of the magazine cover in the ad, which displays the Needlework & Crafts cover.  Since I can't find the magazine conveniently in my North Mississippi area I'll shell out another 50 bucks and order from the publisher, I guess.	neg
I've been a fan of this product for a couple of years, since I have very long, wavy hair. It moisturizes really well and I use it every ten days or so. It smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on, kind of vinegary and spicy, but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. It still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty), but not unpleasant. ---  --- I warm a good handful of this in the microwave, put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun, wait 20 minutes, then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner, like Coolaulin or a small amount of American Cream. If you have short hair you probably won't need this deep of a treatment, but for those of us with a lot of hair, or who have damaged or very thick hair, it is great. It makes my hair shiny and tangle-free again. ---  --- It doesn't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have, so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from Pantene you won't find it here. But the ingredients in this don't build up in your hair the way silicones do, so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair, this is a great deep conditioner	pos
This is Guido Sarduci from the Royal Tuscan Office of Copyrights and Internets and I must insist that you cease any and all sales of theese so called "Tuscan Whole Milks" immediately or I will have to come there and beat you up and then my mom came upstairs and saw me fighting and she got scared and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!" I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan	neg
I wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that Adobe Audition 2.0 WILL NOT install on a Windows 2000 Pro or Server operating system. Almost EVERY reference I have seen regarding OS requirements say Windows but not specifically Windows XP. The only exceptions have been on the Audition box itself and this Amazon listing (go Amazon). So if you are a Windows 2000 user understand that you will need XP for this product. If you can find a copy of Audition 1.5 you're good to go. ---  --- I would say more about the product if I could actually get it installed but with the 12 PCs I use not a one has XP so I have a $300+ book end until I can upgrade (if you can call it that) to XP	neg

This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing.

I missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots, which is why I got these. They are great! The only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel. They are very thing. I'd wear them out in a day. I had to have them resoled. But the Ammazon price was so good it was still a steal.	pos
I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular.  It kept me awake but just on the verge.  The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie.  I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star. 	neg
I prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that Meyerberg sells. The condensed has a more sour flavor to it.  One has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes "different". When it is warm, it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste. Cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor. --- I actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good. It is like ice milk as this is milk, but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet. --- The recipe was 1 quart milk (8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill) --- 1 cup white sugar --- 1 tsp vanilla flavoring (you can try other flavorings like banana) --- 1/8 tsp salt --- My electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes. --- I like the powdered for it's ease and it keeps well. I can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks, so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk. Granted one is used to cow's milk, but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and I am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right. --- One can will make 3 quarts of milk	pos
I first purchased this book when I was a freshman in college seven years ago. It is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing I have ever read.  I love the plastic tabs that mark each section.  This guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section.  So for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the MLA style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab.  I have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college.  I really wish I had this book when I was in high school.  I highly recommend this book to any high school, college, graduate student or writer.  I especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities, I myself have ADD and before I got this guide I could not understand how to write a paper in the MLA style or in any style other than a book report.  I promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published	pos

If you're like me, you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time. BeneFit's Boo Boo Zap! is a bit spendy for such a small amount (about the size of a small tube of lipstick) but it does help. While it won't erase the zit overnight, it will get the red out. You can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear, not tinted. Definitely worth a try	pos
I like this product.  It is very stylish and lightweight.  Definitely, I highly recommend to anyone	pos
This is the 2000 or so version of the DVD.  This is identical with the VHS version, except it adds two features.  The first is an excellent "Making Of" video from 1996 -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006, but all the "interview" segments are the same.  The second was a "Making Of" video done for the DVD, which doesn't add a whole lot. ---  --- Were I to do it again, I'd buy this version, and skip the 2006 "50th anniversary" release.  This is the classic Chuck Jones television "Grinch", in one of the best packages for it. ---  --- And the "Horton Hears A Who" is also a Chuck Jones classic.  "A person's a person, no matter how small."	pos
Why? ---  --- Why waste your time and money on producing crap? ---  --- Sony execs must be out of their minds. The Ghostbuster fans have been waiting years, and writing countless petitions to get the episodes on DVD, and this is what they come up with? ---  --- No. Give us season DVDs. Give us a 140 episode box set. Give us something. Not 4 non-sequential episodes on a disc that can hold MANY times that. ---  --- What a waste. This product gets 1 star because, apparently, you can't give it zero	neg

I was very excited to get these bowls in the mail because they are so cute, and the concept of having a suction bowl was (and is) appealing to me. My son loved the bowl right away, as he was able to reach into the bowl for some puffs to feed himself instead of having to push the puffs around the table until he could finally grab one in his fingers. I'd also like to add that he ate tofu cubes for the first time out of this bowl and loved them! However, I'm disappointed because the suction on the bowl does not work for more than a few seconds. I'm constantly pushing the bowl back down, which is disruptive to his meal. Despite some of happy memories I've had with this bowl, I would not recommend buying these bowls because as 'suction bowls' they do not serve their purpose	neg
I bought this for my husbands birthday.  He was very excited.  He had been looking at bags at a local store and hadn't found anything as nice as this, especially for the price.  Plenty of room for his laptop and pens, notebooks, extra books, etc.  Very durable, highly recommend	pos
I am a dancer. I found the choreography in this movie beautiful, brillient and different. The emotion in it really touched me, and I had actually fallen out of dancing because of many different reasons and this movie really did bring me back to my love of dance. It's very rare to find dance movie that will offer quite as much as this movie did. Not to mention I absolutly adore George De La Pena. Awsome dancer and he was my favorite character in the movie. I love the fact that every character has something they are working through, no one is exactly perfect. To me, although the acting may not be what every one would call oscar quality, to me, it shows a glimps in to life. How pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some times difficult to get through. This movie, to me is well worth the watch. Sorry for the ramble.	pos
The songs are boring, the lyrics are plain. I am so dissapointed. I bought it without listening to it first thinking I would at least find one song.

I've used MS Streets and Trips for years with minor problems.  This year I upgraded to a Windows Vista Laptop and wanted the latest software for it.  I have a GPS and I use a Pocket PC PDA so I need Pocket Streets. ---  --- After I got home I read the fine print on the box.  It list support for no higher than the Windows XP OS.  But, so far the program is running fine on my Vista machine. ---  --- The laptop has no serial COM ports and S&T 2007 won't detect a USB port. The description of S&T 2007 which includes a GPS indicates it uses a USB port but apparently it needs the included USB adaptor.  I could not locate where I could purchase such an adapter. ---  --- S&T 2007 no longer ships with Pocket Streets.  Nor could I locate where I could download a copy.  I can (for now) use my old Pocket Streets program because 2007 does EXPORT Pocket Street maps. ---  --- Finally, within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90's.  The main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet S&T 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when I get directions I always end up down a dead-end road. ---  --- I've purchase many versions of Streets and Trips and this is the first time I felt I've wasted my money. Open software can't be returned from where I purchased it.  I guess I'll have to start researching other software packages. --- 	neg
     Initially I was going to order several items from Andrew Christian, until I saw their shipping prices at checkout.  $2 shipping on EACH $4 tee-shirt was more than excessive, they were going to charge me $20 shipping on a $42 order!  I canceled most of the items, only ordering a belt and a tee.  Shipping was still ~ 50% surcharge. ---      Received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective.  The buckle is on backwards (no, it's not reversible...) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole.  It isn't worth the shipping cost & hassle to send it back, I'll probably just throw it away - but I did learn something. ---      I will never deal with Andrew Christian again!  I you choose to, please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out - you may decide to revise your order	neg
I absolutely agree with the two other reviewers.  I had very high hopes too as I use McCann's Brown Bread mix ALL THE TIME - I don't think I could live without it, so I was very disappointed with the Fruit Scones Mix.  There is a very weird taste, to me it seems like 'soapy' or something, but definitely not a pleasure to eat.  I've got tons of bags left of this mix which I will have to throw away.  I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product, sorry	neg
Just wanted to quickly say I haven't finished it yet, I am only on page 20  but already this book seems very overrated. The author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness, but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views. Instead, he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate, conclusive authority on spirituality, and it's very aloof and, actually, not an enlightened approach at all! I've just started the chapter on Karma and it's really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people's opinions clothed as quasi-originality. It looks like I'm going to continue reading with a very cautious, vetting attitude toward the text. The fact that this was a bestseller only serves to show how genuinely interested people are to develop their spiritual consciousness - and how easily authors such as Zukav can cash in on their hopes and fears. Hey, that's the material world for you!	neg
My daughter is just learning how to self-feed and these placemats are great.  I've always been weary of those restaurant tables and how clean the cloths they use to wipe them are.  This product solves that problem.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the corner does come off.  However, I do NOT find this to be a major problem.  Also, I tried the tip from other moms who fold the bottom half over the edge of the table.  Great tip.  Thanks.  This is a great product for kids learning to eat	pos
While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.  The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless.  It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality.	neg
I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena. ---  --- Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts). ---  --- When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational. ---  --- At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product. ---  --- No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation. ---  --- Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.	neg

These definately firt the bill, and the with the cheap $35.00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers, you can't go wrong.

I first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages.  The children were enthralled with the illustrations (as were many adults) but the "message" was deeply felt by the "older" child in all of us there.  It is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have.  Mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him, and brought him pleasure.  He wished that he could influence others, but never knew what his music did for the world.  Maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for.  The message is true for children and adults alike. I will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend, and from the pulpit. Thank you, David McPhail	pos

Ancient Sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us.  First, Fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room.  Zombies finally have an 1800 attacker.  Machines have a mean burn monster.  The rares are something else.  Soul Resurrection is a Call of the Haunted except the monster goes into defence mode.  And it's only a rare! There is also Blowback Dragon, who like his brother, Barrel Dragon, has the same effect.  Instead of destroying monsters only, Blowback destroys ANY card on the field.  Zaborg the Thunder Monarch is also a plus to this set, destroying any monster on the field when summoned.  I got this 5 set and got Gear Golem, the Moving Fortress, Enemy Controller, Draining Shield, Zaborg the Thunder Monarch and Avatar of the Pot.  In other words, buy it.  This is worth the money	neg
After living with this film for 15 years, it seems to me that the best description of its theme comes in the words of the character Liz (Jane Birkin), who in context is speaking of the work of her husband, the painter Frenhofer.  According to her, it concerns something "shameful--it's not the body that is shameful, not the nudity, but something else . . ." ---  --- That "something else" is a violation, existentially speaking, of the enigma of the painter's model.  Such a violation cannot be seen without the mediation of art.  In a cinematic context, it is the risk the direction takes whenever it approaches its subject frontally, and we can see Rivette's tendency to retreat to wide shots, to place events off-screen, or to circle behind his players. Is this a critique of Bresson, who insisted on calling his players "models" rather than "actors?"  (It is impossible not to recall the storied psychological scars Bresson's methods allegedly left on his players. )  It is clearly not that simple, for there are close-ups in NOISEUSE that seem to be as cruel to the actors as Frenhofer is to his model. ---  --- This goes beyond Bresson in other ways: Rivette, always the reader, has patched together a thumping good story from literary sources ranging from Poe to Balzac to James, and in the process has created a true mystery thriller.  That the mystery hinges on four-minute shots of a hand scratching out a drawing makes it no less thrilling.  It tumbles forward toward a profoundly ironic ending worthy of the best James novels. ---  --- The initial critical take on this film was that it was the most thorough document of the artistic process ever committed to film.  Well, yes and no.  It seems to be about the artistic process of a painter, but I think there may be a playful game of "bait-and-switch" afoot.  Watch Béart.  Watch, especially, Piccoli, who is a veritable encyclopedia of the actor's art, as mesmerizing in his scudding, absent-minded movements as he is in his sudden precision, always surprising.  Rivette's devotion to actors is clear in all his films: think of his sets, so resembling stages with their creaky boards, a sound "effect" in Rivette that more often than not takes the place of score. ---  --- It may be that the artist of canvas, plaster, stone, or screen may reveal something secret, even  shameful, in his models.  It may even be that the unscrupulous artist is a thief of the soul.  But Rivette, for one, shows in LA BELLE NOISEUSE that he has given these things some serious thought.  And he is always generous to his actors.  The result is that the trust between artist and model demonstrated in this film amounts to a strong rebuke to the idea that film cannot show thought.  It can; it comes at a price, but in the hands of a master it can be as great a gift to the players as it is to the audience	pos

The stuff can seem somewhat pricy (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror.

I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months before they even shipped the product, because it was the first reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD.  Living in Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount of time. I did not use it on weekends. --- Anyway, I think that it helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that helped the most. --- I will indeed use the light again this winter, because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me	pos

I was not sure what to expect upon receiving a box of this tea as a gift during the holiday season, and indeed the ingredients struck me as rather unusual.  Being a person who generally likes my tea and coffee black with no flavoring whatsoever, I was rather suspicious of the orange, grapefruit, and other extra 'scents'.  However, I was delighted with the concoction.  The extras are definately present, giving a slightly citric quality to the tea but are not the least bit overpowering and provide a unique  aroma that is quite pleasing.   ---  --- I do recommend steeping it for a long time to get the most out of the leaves, especially if you are to get the citric scents that make it so unique. 	pos
The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.   ---  --- Targus makes decent laptop cases, but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently.   ---  --- Apparently it does fit some cameras, just not the Panasonic FZs. ---  --- Considering the product is made in China one should be able to expect a bit more at this price	neg

The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones. ---  --- In summary, this is a great camera.  Oh, the phone functions are fine, too.  Reception is pretty good on the T-Mobile + Cingular networks (used by Speak Out Wireless).  Voice is clear and loud.  Really good.  5 stars	pos
this phone has all the feature that i wanted. The camera takes really good picture.  Better than all the phone i've seen so far.  The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures.  I use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures.  It has auto-focus and other several fucntion that i haven't used yet.  The mp3 player is also very useful.  I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone.  It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions.  My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded.  it's just like plugging in a flash drive.  The screen is very bright and clear.  The screen resolution is decent.  It's very easy to customize also.  I dl program online to customize the theme.  The battery lasted a lot longer than i expected. Usually last around 3-4 days. --- The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones.  Walkman series have way better headphones so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter.  Another complain is the expensive memory stick micros.  I couldn't use the memory from my w800i phone. and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used	pos

Amazon's site made no mention of the products not being in stock, charged my cc, and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered.  My first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else, and my second call (upon not receiving a return call) revealed the real facts.

Overall, I was entirely disappointed with this camaera.  The packaging and description were deceiving.  There was no view finding screen, only a teeny, tiny window as in a regular camera.  This was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera.  I bought it because I wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen.  The construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE	neg

It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs.  Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves.  (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens.  I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing.  It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn.  All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway.

I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).	neg
I found this CD by browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I am happy with all of the tracks.  Some tracks remind me of Beatles a little, but not all, so the band does have a unique sound.  Even though from the 90s, the sound is like many bands making it today.  I like it.	pos

I usually do not endorse a product as "a must have" due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community... however, this item is the only exception to my rule.  I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with Carpel-Tunnel Syndrome can testify to, it's a real pain to load THAT much one at a time.  To satisfy this problem, enter the speed loader. ---  --- Pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds, place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly.  That easy.  Easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds.  It's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover.  Sounds ridiculous but I've seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with. ---  --- But let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you.  I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort.  I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic, not metal.   ---  --- Lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer.  Sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house, let them clean it up.  ;	pos
Very good - not a rich dessert by any means, but a healthy, filling snack. My kids really like them, and while they aren't low-calorie or really low-fat, it isn't full of sugar, and it contains "healthy" fat. The 5-grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full	pos

I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put. 	neg
   This shaver replaced a Norelco Advantage (6 years old) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a charge for more than a couple of days.  I can't honestly say if it shaves as close as a blade because I haven't shaved with a blade in many years.   ---  ---     I have used foil shavers in the past (Braun and Panasonic) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth it. ---  ---     I have been using this shaver for about 3 months.  During that time I have charged it only twice including the initial charge and that is using it at least every other day.  At first I thought it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out that it shaves much closer than my old Advantage which I thought was doing a great job. ---  ---    It shaves quick and close ( Personally I think as close as a blade).  When you are done shaving you just rinse it under the tap and let it dry. It doesn't get any easier than that. I have cleaned the heads once as stated in the instructions and that is easy too. ---  ---     The only con is I have dry sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3 comfort settings. Use electric shave before shaving and I think that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without the irritation.  ---  ---  Highly recommended and worth the price.  ---    	pos
I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present.  I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it.  We've had it 4 weeks.  What a great pool toy!  Kids love it!  We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine.  I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.  It seems to be well built and sturdy.  I wouldn't hesitate to get on it.  Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case.  It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids.  Overall great gift idea	pos
Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either. ---  --- So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including "Happy Together" and "Fallen Angels" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's "Breathless", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory. ---  --- The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate. --- 	neg
Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble, lots of trouble putting it together. It's not the product's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha. Seems the parts could've been marked better. Identification is pretty much visual. Instead, you have a "picture map" to compare what part is needed. I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt, stripped the bolt trying to get it out, got the WD40 on it, finally had to use a crescent wrench. So, my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards. The assemblage directions could be better, believe me. I used the 800# once, but I finally found that no matter what was suggested, the picture was misleading and there's no way that could've been explained. Onward through the fog!	neg
Drummer Hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of Drummer Hoff, the man who "fired it off." In this story, a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon. Each man brings something different. One man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at the every end of each stanza it says "but Drummer Hoff fired it off." ---  This story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story. The colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal. The story itself doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a fun book. The rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous. By the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess. ---  --- Children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud. A good holiday gift.	pos
I bought this to puree my 6 month old daughter's homemade baby foods.  You put the blade at the bottom of the cup, load the food in, then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece (which contains the motor) on top.  The concept seemed good and it is a compact size.  CONS:  1) The cup holds less than 1 cup of food...if you go over that amount, any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess, and sometimes causes the motor to stop running...guess it shorts it out and I have to wait until it dries out before I can start again.  If you're trying to make enough to freez cubes of food, you'll have to puree several batches.  2) You can only run the motor for short periods of time...up to 20 seconds max or something like that for some foods.  This is fine for soft foods, but if trying to puree meats, for example, it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind, wait, grind, wait....3) the motor that powers the blade is way too slow, cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy, since you really need a faster blade to puree them.  I've found that the for pureering baby foods, the best thing to use is a blender, since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed.  Don't waste your money on buying this	neg

THAT LASER IS VERY USEFUL. This model is the most expensive but is the best one. I kept going back and forth Office Maxto return other models of the same brand but this was it. I'm definitely not returning this thing. It's ergonomic; just pull down instead of pushing down. I get a straigter cut without the blade going out of wack like the other models of this brand. Worth every penny if you ask me. Especially if you make business cards.	pos
Our one year old loves this one, and so do I.  The music is wonderful.  The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational.

Ohm... Ohm... Ohm... ---  --- Back in 2000, Ellipsis Arts released OHM: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music, a fantastic and essential three CD set tracing the evolution of "electronica" from Messiaen, Cage, and Xenakis to Schulze, Eno, and Hassell. This set was recently reissued (as OHM+) along with a bonus DVD, which is thankfully now available separately for those of us who already have the CDs. ---  --- The OHM+ DVD is jam-packed with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably dull. ---  --- If seemingly endless "talking head" interviews with Milton Babbitt and Bebe Barron are your idea of video entertainment, you've come to the right place. An interview with John Cage digitally altered beyond all recognition? Check. Swirling psychadelic colored dyes right out of a Saucerful of Secrets-era Pink Floyd concert? No problem. ---  --- There are some tastier goodies to be found on this DVD, however... ---  --- The segments with Clara Rockmore and Leon Theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie quality to them. It's also a real treat to see the 1978 footage of underappreciated minimalist guru David Borden and Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company "on the road" hauling around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment. Laurie Spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey metal box called a "Concerto Generator" with an extremely serious expression on her face. And Alvin Lucier's "Music for Solo Performer," where he hooks up wires to his head and produces sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani, simply must be seen to be believed. ---  --- The Pixar-ish computer animation accompanying Paul Lansky's "The Dust Bunny" is sort of cute, but it goes on for about 10 minutes too long. Surely most of the OHM target audience already has the DVD of Steve Reich's Three Tales, but it's nice that they included the best part - the ominous yet goofy "Dolly" segment. Many have also probably seen Hans Fjellestad's documentary Moog before, but the six minute excerpt provided here is really about all you need. ---  --- It's too bad there isn't a more interesting John Cage segment, and regrettable that there aren't any Stockhausen videos (those would certainly be a riot!) ---  --- Overall, though, while the OHM+ DVD is not as consistently engaging as the CD set of the same name, it is a worthy companion to it. And if you don't have either of them yet, the complete OHM+ 3-CD & DVD "special edition" box set is a no-brainer	pos
For the first time in several versions Microsoft has changed the file format.  However, it is for the better.  The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files).  The new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification (i.e. Linux geeks can open Office documents). ---  --- The new interface is RADICALLY different.  Do not install this if you have a large project to complete.  The interface is SO different you will not complete on time.  However, after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it	pos

I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly.  ---  --- This game is a particularly nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic "tow truck".  Melissa and Doug have made two other puzzles similar to this, a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle, with the same concept.  This one, however, might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks. ---  --- One of our pieces (on the fishing version of this puzzle) did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent toy!	pos

I am a big Ambrosia fan and I love "Biggest Part of Me", "You're the Only Woman", "How Much I Feel" and the newer track "I Just Can't Let Go".  However, I wish this CD contained all of their Billboard Hot 100 hits.  The CD is missing their cover of "Magical Mystery Tour" (#39) and "How Can You Love Me" (#86).  For the casual listener, this CD is perfect.  For the chart hit completionists out there, it misses a couple songs.  I bought this CD used for $1.99, which was a HUGE bargain for the songs included.  For that price, I can certainly try to download the missing tracks	pos

I am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years, I have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right (or slice under pressure).  I have tried the Medicus, and still slice and other gizmos (swing jacket....junk) to no avail.  The swing setter worked for me.  It showed me a flaw in my grip (by the way, this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others I routinely play with) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane.  I tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left (still some over the top) but getting better every day.  I recommend combining this with the Swing Rite for a powerful swing.  You will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don't look like a goof on the range.  Give it a try, it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me.  Good Golfing	pos

This is truly a good system. Iv'e sat on it, dropped it, kicked it, thrashed it, and it still is working fine. I did consider buying the psp at first but then i thought, I have an ipod nano, a dvd player, and a laptop. I didn;'t see the point for having 2 of the above. Also, honsetly, who would want to go on the web with a slow psp. CAn you imagine how hard it is to type!! Anyway, the games i recommend for the nds is mario kart ds, animal crossing, megaman battle network five, and for people that are reall hard core gamers, spiderman. (this is an extrmeley har game trust me) ---  --- Also, i do find picto chat quite usless. 33ft range isn't enough. Also, i was reading the psp reviews and about 85 percent of them said that the psp is for more mature gamers. What got me is that alot of kid reviews were saying that. All these kids playing M rated games is sorta scary, but that's just my opion.  ---      Also if you have the "fat" ds, dont buy a ds lite. Thres no need unless your eyesight is bad. All it has is a brighter screen and a sleeker design. So it's not werth it. Once again this is only my opion, im just giving my advice.  ---     The wifi feature is pretty cool. I am aware that psp has this too by the way. Anyway, mario kart ds does a great job usuing wi-fi. The feeling of sitting in your room playing with people across the world on this handheld is quite an extroindary feeling.  ---     Well, all in all, if you really need a gaming device with good grapghics and multi media features get the psp. But im warning you it is very very fragile.  ---     If you have a music device and a computer and just want a good gaming system with great games and is very durable, get nds. ---    They are both good systems just think about what you need in a system, Do you want a gaming device, or a multimedia device. Its your choice in the end. I hope this review has helped, I just want to make your shopping a tad bit easiers. ---        Cheers, Hisham Amery ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 	pos
I recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years.  I was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup.  Everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup.  I was disappointed in the dice tray.  It is very flimsy and not properly designed.  It should have a rotator and be made of more durable material.  Also, the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals.  I felt ripped off when I discovered this obvious mistake	neg

I agree almost completely with JWALKER019. This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is  downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd. Tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the Princess.  It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big  disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is highly unlikely.  I've given this La Scala DVD 2 stars but that is probably being generous	neg

I love his voice, but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted.  There are about 12 key changes in every song.

I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along.

I've had a GE and a Sony (CD543RM) kitchen under counter units.  I've also tested a few others in stores.  The Sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the Sony 553 is superior to the Sony 543.  The 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and AM/FM reception. 	pos
I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby.

We have the original Itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in. The originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station. After reading the instructions I plugged the new Itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals. Not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away. That is better than I expected after reading all the feedback. I'm not sure what everyones problem is. It's not a radio tower, it's a transmitter the size of your finger. I get the feeling that some people think it should power the City block.	pos

Good old silly, irreverent Slade never really caught on in the US, but their melodic early-70s glam rock sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then, and this is the best collection of their works, including all of the Slade's hit singles from the early '70s, from 1971's "Get Down And Get With It" to 1975's "Thanks For The Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam)". ---   ---  Slade scored a whopping 11 Top Five hits between 1971 and 1974 (five of which topped the charts), and they're all here. So are their latter-day chart entries, like 1983's #2 hit "My Oh My", but Slade never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock peak, and "Feel The Noize" captures them in all their glory, filled with Noddy Holder and Jim Lea's big, dumb, misspelled shout-along hits ("Look Wot You Dun", "Mama Weer All Crazee Now", "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me" and "Gudbuy T'Jane")	pos

Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.    	neg

This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately. It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise, the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should, even though the body length was normal for a regular. I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long. So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves	neg
Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced	neg

I was disappointed getting this product because I've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron.  I actually prefer the cheaper Conair's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one.  It doesn't clamp down well on my hair (I've got thick frizzy hair).  The results for me aren't that great, it straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy.  It's lightweight which is nice.  I don't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair.  I definitely prefer other models over this one. 	neg
 --- "In Old Chicago" was a blockbuster movie made in 1937, a box office smash which contributed significantly to the emergence of 20th Century Fox as a major studio. Seeing the roadshow version of this film makes one wonder why Fox bothered to put the shorter version on the DVD because you will never view it again.  All of a sudden, the dramatic portions of the film make better sense, with the smooth continuity of a Henry King directed film and notably missing from the shorter version.  All the principals' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now has more depth.  For example, instead of being told Don Ameche is an honest lawyer, we SEE him in action; instead of being told Tyrone Power is a crook, we SEE him offering bribes. Power, in particular, is very convincing as the charming Irish rogue. ---  --- The story is a corny tale of the O'Leary family and has that hokey quality which undermined a lot of Fox's big productions. By the time you have heard for the third time that "We O'Learys are a strange tribe", you can almost hope that they suffer some unspeakable death when the fire starts! Alice Faye plays Belle Fawcett, the dance hall attraction whom the crooked Power marries.  This was Faye's bid for major stardom when she replaced Jean Harlow who died just before production began.  Faye is diffident at first but her confidence grows and the film was a great success for her.  Her version of "Carry Me Back to ol' Virginny" is memorable.  Alice Brady won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Mrs O'Leary but there is nothing to warrant it except a good Irish brogue and the fact that she is playing a serious part for once instead of the screwball mothers for which she was typecast. ---  --- The special effects which make up the last 20 minutes of the film are spectacular and really give the film the status it has retained. The DVD package contains a couple of short newsreels and a Biography program of Don Ameche but it would have benefited from a commentary for such an important film. --- 	pos

I have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries (6 two-packs) and I must say that they work exactly how I projected them to. They hold a charge well enough for my uses in  various electronics and my infant's papasan swing. Regular Duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days.

The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care.

I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 ¾" balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull.  Rated 1 Star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment, and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 ¾" balls	neg
Straps on this shoe are very short and since they close with velcro, they are too short.  I tried to add velcro, but that didn't work.  I had to give the shoes away.

Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless. ---  --- I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this	neg
I subscribe to Parents, Parenting and Child magazine and will renew all but the one to Child. It's full of ridiculous fashion spreads (like I'm going to spend $50 on a t-shirt for my 15-month old), useless travel information and near-advertising features on the newest, most expensive items I 'need' for my child. The actual articles are no better or worse than what's in the other mags, and I don't find there's nearly as much information in the magazine as in the others. ---  --- As other reviewers have said, it is beautiful. However, it's thoroughly impractical unless you're one of those people who plan to shop at Neiman's for your child...not that there's anything wrong with that	neg
This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through. 	neg
I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book.  I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie	neg
Abby Cooper has become my favorite amateur PI. The premise of this series, a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases, is original and fun to read. Abby is a psychic, but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money, sibling and romance issues. In this latest book, Abby, her sister Cat, and Abby's handyman Dave, buy and plan to renovate a house, only the house turns out to be haunted! Poor Dave, Abbey's partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation! Determined to find out what's going on, Abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to WWII Nazi Germany. In order to solve the mystery, Abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case. There is danger for Abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between Abby and Dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple. Ms. Laurie has a great series going here, and I look forward to reading more Abby mysteries.	pos
How he makes money "acting" is amazing to me.  These Hollywood versions of a fake historic events make me cringe.  Especially when Hollywood exec's send their " talent" to making the rounds on talk shows to plug the painful" blockbuster" that's going to be a BIG FLOP and they know it but they think people are stupid (and most of us are) but Hollywood hates to lose money so they put a spin on it anyway, I'd laugh if it wern't so sad.  Anyway, Tom's army unit was choosen to update the Japanese army at the request of the puppet emperor , but really it's the emperor's councelor who makes all the decisions, so, the evil councelor decides to "westernize" his army the samuri swordsmen must be totally destroyed.  Tom accidently on purpose kills a samuri and feels bad so he tries to make it up to the wife and son then he realizes a brutal beauty to the life of a samuri and joins them.  It's very paint by the numbers story and acting, even the Japanese landscape is boring.  Of course the U.S. Army is painted as bad guys when the whole blame for the mess and bloodshed that follows can be put squarely on the shoulders of the weak emperor who didn't have the guts to put things right with the samuri in the first place. Then Tommy has some kind of ephifany and decides to stay in Japan. Snore. This movie was too long, and with all the money spent on this movie it really could have been a 1/2 decent semi-historic story about the destruction of the samuri in Japan	neg

Lamp is nice.Gives excellent lighting for desk work.Buying Partners,LLC was very good in handling a lamp that had problems with the bulb not staying on.The only downsize to owning this lamp is that the 13 Watt bulb can only be purchased at select stores .Seems like discount stores don't carry them.Also,replacement bulbs are expensive( most likely it would be cheaper to just replace the whole lamp than just the bulb).Some reviews on the bulb say that it does not last as long as the 10,000 hours advertised. --- Having said all that,go ahead and purchase the lamp.At the price you can't go wrong.Merry Christmas To All 	pos

This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh. ---  --- Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!!

as the director and actors of this mess should, on their skinny french knees.  Complete waste of film and your time. Not erotic, sexy (? was that actress really a woman?, was her boyfriend really a man? or visa/versa) Damned if I could tell.  And that old man who tired her up, ya think he had enough rope? The movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through.  French people are not pretty, and this woman was not only NOT pretty, but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma.  Even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog.  Save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience	neg
I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones. --- Hope this helped, good luck	pos

This seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained.

As the mom of a boy, I don't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat, but even for boys this seat is mess free. And with boys, there is usually a little mess, but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily.  I love it, and my son loves it.

...and not just a half-baked product placement tool. BioWare's decision to make the game pre-date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom, even within the confines of the Star Wars brand. ---  --- The biggest reason why KOTOR won over 40 game-of-the-year awards (yes, over 40) is not because you get to swing a double-bladed lightsaber around and use Force powers; it's because of the story! A strong plot is crucial for every RPG, and KOTOR doesn't disappoint. This plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history (all you fans out there know what I'm talking about! If you don't, then go out and buy this game now). ---  --- The game's principal characters, while somewhat stereotypical (i.e. Bastila is the condescending socialite snob, Carth is the tough loner with a troubled past, etc), work very well together and have good chemistry, including with you, the created character. For example, if you play as a female character, it soon becomes obvious that Carth develops feelings for you, but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago. You'll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don't get along with each other, i.e. Canderous and Carth, because they fought on opposite sides in the Mandalorian Wars that took place five years before. And aside from the character development, the game feels very rich in its "Star Wars-ness" -- for example, some of the names that BioWare came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like George Lucas himself approved them. ---  --- Despite what I said earlier in this review, cutting down your enemies with a lightsaber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of KOTOR. I admit that when I first got to Dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a Jedi, I was trembling at excitement that I was going to build my own lightsaber, as I wondered what color I was going to choose. ---  --- Having said all that, there are some things that keep this game from getting 5 stars. I felt the game was a bit linear (being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the ILLUSION of open-ended gameplay). I was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether I decide to be evil or good, but everything plays the same, save a few minor events and certain conversations. Also, there is a "doorway bug" that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors. When this happens you can wiggle the thumbstick and free yourself; I've never had any real problems with this bug, but it can get distracting. Also I found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic; you press start to go to the main menu, then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens, but often I have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds. Also, I'm sure many people would agree that the game's graphics are not up to Xbox standards; even the PS2 is capable of doing better! I don't usually gripe about graphics, but the textures on some background buildings on Taris are downright laughable. ---  --- Overall, I have to give BioWare serious Kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new Star Wars game, and I sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun. It is not a stretch to say that I bought an Xbox just to play KOTOR (and a few other titles, but that's another story), and I'm glad I made the investment. Hey, stop reading this and go play	pos
 --- You can tell a lot about the readership a men's magazine is trying to reach by scanning the first three car ads. In the issue in front of me, they flog the Lincoln MKZ, Range Rover Sport, and Audi A6. ---  --- There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe. ---  --- But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH. ---  --- It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs. ---  --- To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS. ---  --- In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, where there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you. ---  --- Don't mistake this monthly for serious journalism. But you won't need a brown paper bag to carry it out of the store either. ---  --- I kind of like it	pos

this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.

I bought this after renting the hospital-grade Medela Lactima.  Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.   ---  --- The little cooler is cute, but it's tough to actually fit the frozen insert ("blue" plastic thing) AND four bottles in there.  And it is convenient for the horns to pump directly into standard-size bottles (it will pump into Dr. Browns & Evenflo bottles too, any regular mouth size bottles) or bags.   ---  --- I love the setup, just wish the pump had slower speed settings and that the speed & suction were truly adjustable and independent from each other.  I can't be in pain like this all the time and am looking for other options.  :( 	neg

Constantly shifting it to get it's high and low points in a place that was tolerable. I finally reversed it, pointing it towards me and it worked a little better. This just needs to be a simple pad. Instead, they've overdesigned it as a gimmick.	neg
I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky! ---  --- Plus I have a manufacturing flaw in them.  Inside the heel the seam isnt quite right and it rubs my skin and hurts like heck!  ---  --- Hopefully the next model I get isnt like thses or they are going back....... Putting up with these for now.......	neg
I experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod.

I going to write the for non techs out there... ---  --- I can use it, my wife can use it, my mom can use it and my 5 year old son can use it. It is just that simple to use. You do not need to know anything about taking shots, other than how to zoom and pick the right settings, and if you play with the camera for a few days you will know them. --- One other reviewer said to get the following: --- 1. At least a 512 MB Memory Stick Pro Duo to take 160 or so pictures in one go --- 2. Rechargeable AA batteries and a charger --- 3. Case ---  --- and i must say YES, YES and YES... to all, they are a must... ---  --- This camera, feels good in your hands, screen size is great. You can see the screen in both sunlight and at nights. --- The menu is very easy to follow and the quality of the picture are clean and clear. --- i can't comment on the software that comes with the camera as i have a Apple computer and i use iPhoto. --- For the price, i felt like i got a $[...] Sony... --- 	pos
I bought 2 of these controllers for my kids, because I didn't want cables in the middle of our Family Room nor did I want them sitting too close to the TV when they played. --- This controllers are excellent. They work perfectly, they are easy to store because of the lack of cables, the weight is fine for small children, the range of the signal is more than enough and they aren't battery eaters. I use them as well and they are wonderful. --- They are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations	pos

                                                            Siri Amster- Olszewski ---                  August 24, 2006 ---  ---  Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well.  The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those times  ---  I was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time.  It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  --- One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage.  For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love.  In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status.  One could not marry below their status.  Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.  ---  The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.  --- Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.   --- I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces.	pos
this is a ridiculous overkill of two fascinating characters in the 'lonesome dove'. the whole 2 dvds were just a bunch of idiots kept blabbering, small talking, yammering, blah, blah, blah from the first second to the last minute, just like mcmurty's novels, all the characters were just kept talking, talking, talking in meaningless small talks, almost talked your ears off. it's so controversial and contradictory to those two characters first appeared in 'lonesome dove', gus talked and talked, but call never talked like what was protrayed in this pathetic 'dead man's walk' and the 'comanchi moon', the more logic one is the real sequel, 'the street of loredo', at least gus was dead, and call remained not just silent but more quiet. by watching this horrible movie adaptation from the original book, scripted by the author, the whole movie was doomed to be horrible. because mcmurty simply couldn't omitted those yammering spread all over his original novel, page after page, blah, blah, blah, and we have to find the storyline among those conversations, dialogs, and dug them out of those garbage-like paragraphs. watching this movie was no different. those idiotic morons never kept their mouths shut. blabbering day and night, even during the comanchi attacks. what call showed in this movie and the novel could never developed into a character like what he had become in 'lonesome dove'. because from the very beginning, everybody just quacked and quacked like a school of chickens. drive me nuts. how come these two young characters portrayed in this blabbering novel would and could have developed into the profound older characters in the 'lonesome dove'? once a moron, a coward, an idiot, always would be a one, no matter how old you have become. adding experiences and sophistication in the aging process never happened to a moron, coward or an idiot. how could these two jokes would have survived in that harsh environment is simply beyond me. at least the 'lonesome dove' movie adaptation was  close to what the novel read like. and 'the street of loredo' movie was also an adaptations from the novel	neg

I like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature: the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature.   ---  --- Ok, so I have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside/outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more.  Many mornings I check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read, for example, 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees.  It will be 60 degrees inside.  ---  --- My window is double-paned, but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings.   ---  --- When not window-mounted and placed by other thermometers, the readings are acceptable and consistent	neg

This Matcha Green Tea Powder is delicious!  It does come slightly pre-sweetened, so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware.  Also, sometimes the package has "Mo-cha" on the label, which is 'Chinese' for Green Tea (exactly the same as Matcha Green Tea).  I used this powder to make a Green Tea Smoothie Frappe and it tasted great.  Highly recommend	pos
My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though)	pos

This product was nothing short of miraculous for me. --- I'm in my early forties now with skin that has been trouble-prone since I hit my teens...and while I have used various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and rosacea (which started about age 40), including retin A cream,  topical and systemic antibiotics, and every sort of over the counter cleanser, these treatments helps but if anything my breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as I aged. ---  --- I've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is the nicest and most healthy it's been in many years....I had rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top of it. ---  --- Caution - I've never had any benzoyle peroxide sensitivity. People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide probably won't have the same kind of experience I do.   ---  --- BP creams have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which really gets down in the pores. ---  --- I use it heavily.  I apply it either before I brush my teeth or before I get in the shower.  It is cool and refreshing.  I usually let it sit as a mask for a few minutes before I rinse off, although sometimes I use it just as a cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after I've walked through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke. ---  --- It leaves my skin very, very  clean,  and *soft.*  I have never had any dryness or irritation from this product at all...indeed, my skin has become less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it used to be angry and irritated all the time.  The dryness others warn of has never been an issue for me.  it makes my skin feel like normal healthy skin. ---  --- Working outside in the heat or cleaning in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.  Now before cleaning or working I will actually put a bit of this mask on- wne I am done,  my skin is none the worse the wear for the activity... I stay clear and smooth.  I guess it blocks the irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores either block or become a haven for bacteria. ---  --- I do not have serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face for most of my adult life.   The benzoyle peroxide mask has ended this trouble for me.  I simply smooth a couple times a day for about the time it takes to brush teeth, and wash it off.  No prescriptions, no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or pustules...just perfect skin for me.  Amazing!!!	pos
As a fan of Pete Seeger's music, I bought this CD in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music.  Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs.  Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang.  I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable "best-of" set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting.  Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic	neg
If one good thing can be said about Dread Pirate, it's that the physical game components reek of quality.  The cloth game board, glass jewels, metal coins, wooden dice and pewter game pieces all come together to give an overall sense of realism to the game.  It's a pity, however, that the game itself isn't nearly as exciting as the pieces. ---  --- Dread Pirate relies entirely on random dice rolls to determine every single outcome of the game.  To move from place to place, you roll dice.  To challenge another player to a "skirmish" (which is how you steal their treasure), you roll dice.  To steal jewels from an enemy's port, you roll dice.  To trade for jewels at a port, you roll dice.  There's absolutely no semblance of any real strategy in this game.  You win by accumulating the most treasure, and the amount of treasure you accumulate depends entirely on how lucky you are in your roll of the dice.   ---  --- This game is not fun, and can even be frustrating, especially for a young child who keeps rolling low numbers.  There's SOME thinking involved...  you need to judge for yourself who you should attack and when, but even if you make the best possible strategic decision, you can still lose the die roll and end up empty-handed. ---  --- I would recommend Dread Pirate only if your family is specifically looking for a game where you don't have to think, and only if your children are mature enough to deal with bad luck (as good/bad luck is the only way to win/lose this game).  If you're looking for an enjoyable family game that everyone can play, I would very much reccommend Cranium over this.  It's less expensive, there's ALOT more to it, and it will have your family getting up, being active, and laughing out loud (instead of sitting around and rolling dice to determine the number of jewels you can take)	neg
Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped.  It is made by this rubbery plastic, and it's just okay.  I wouldn't pay $100 for it, it's true, but I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily.  Not very durable... but I got mine for free, so I guess I wasn't too surprised it was given away.	neg

In this film made in UK and Luxembourg, Madeline Stowe stars as Senga. Senga and her daughter Nat are driving at midnight after visiting Nat's father. They bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop. Nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult. And we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter. ---  --- Both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood. Why they do so is never explained. And even at this point when Senga is trying to rescue Nat, she still acts like a brat. The last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion. And becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating I assigned. ---  --- That good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction, not the wirtting. The movie is dark and suspenseful. Though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie, it does keep you on the edge of the seat as Senga tries to rescue her daughter	neg
I've owned three pairs of these so far, and they're easily the best gloves I've ever used.  I had previously only used unpadded gloves, and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first.  The padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them (lat pulldown bars, for example), but that's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips.   ---  --- I found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded Harbinger gloves I've worn.  The gloves can be safely washed and air dryed, as advertised. ---  --- My only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove.  Every pair I have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area. 	pos
We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.  ---      The elongate was to cover an area of 84".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour. ---      The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs. ---      It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening. ---      To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy. ---      I highly recommend this gate.	pos

I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn	neg
I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent. 	neg
This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen.  Don't let the title or the box fool you.  Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment.  I was shocked that such a film could come out of France.

As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business.  ---  --- I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder. ---  --- Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that.  ---  --- Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing: there is a reason people don't get facials, chemical peels, and microderm every day, or even more once a month. The adage "too much of a good thing" stands true here. ---  --- if you need more convincing, please refer to the following links and make the decision your self. ---  --- [...	neg

To turn off your check engine light on most vehicles, with your vehicle turned off, pull out and hold your trip odometer reset stick and then start your vehicle. In most cases the light will shut off. If there is truly a problem with you car, the light will either not stay off or come right back on. You do not need this device to do that. The second problem is if your car does need attention, this device won't really properly diagnose or certainly won't fix it and you'll still have to go to a mechanic.

Infested (Josh Olson, 2002) ---  --- It's really kind of impressive that a movie this bad doesn't get shelved somewhere along the line. And yet here it is, in all its painfully cheesy glory, on my screen, daring me to turn it off. I almost gave in to the temptation, but I kept watching. For you, dear reader, so I can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here-- the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it.  ---  --- The story, what there is of it: A number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high-school buddies, who's killed himself. There's all the post-funeral bonding stuff, and everything's looking remarkably Big Chill when things go horribly, horribly wrong thanks to vicious, genetically-altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers. Yes, you got that right.  ---  --- As usual, the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor. Any Jo Johnson plays the dead guy's girlfriend (well, ex, I guess), and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin. It is not, however, an out-and-out nude scene. Sorry, guys. There is also the gorgeous Lisa Ann Hadley (General Hospital/Port Charles), who's really starting to look like Kate Hodge. (This is a good thing. A very good thing.) ---  --- You're certainly not watching for the special effects, (amateur even by microbudget-indie standards), the acting (atrocious), the script (even worse), the direction (competent at best), the cinematography (ditto), the soundtrack (cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago), or, really, anything else. So it's gotta be the cheesecake. And that's all well and good, but you can do that on fast-forward. I strongly suggest that route. At least you'll waste less time on this. (half	neg

This publication is, in my opinion, the most intelligent, funny, and readable magazine about PC games available. It blows the competition offered up by the U.S. magazines out of the water.  ---  --- You get: ---  --- *A dual-sided DVD loaded with demos, movies, screenshots, podcasts, games, mods, patches, and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your PC ---  --- *Humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the US version. ---  --- *Lots of material- it's thick and the pages are much bigger in size. You feel like you're getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy, cheap catalogue of advertisements.  ---  --- *Quality- both in the writing and physically. There are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month. They are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read. The pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear, and is easy to read. ---  --- Pick up a copy of this from a shop like Barnes and Nobles sometime to see what it's like. I guarantee you'll be impressed, especially if you're used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond	pos
This is an ideal movie for home theatre.  I grew up on a working ranch and Richard Farnsworth, James Caan and Jane Fonda are totally convincing as  cowboys and cowgirl.

Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader.  From pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes.  He attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds.  Each chapter presents a new market setting which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points.  While the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student.  All terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well.  The book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings.  However, I would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book	pos
     I put this mount on my M-44 today, and I am not impressed.  There is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount, and where the original sight seats.  Not a whole lot, but you don't need much play to have your zero [...] out after a couple of rounds. ---  ---      All of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes.  One of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it.  The screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on, so I mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight.  The mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted, and this was obvious to the unaided eye - the mount was pointing left of true, and I don't know if the scope would be able to compensate!  I don't think Loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place, once a few rounds have gone down range.  Some of the supplied allen wrenches didn't even fit the set screws! ---  ---      I have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted, and I am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss.  The design could work, if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process. ---  ---      On the plus side, it was cheap, and the shipping was quick. 	neg
My child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it.  I allowed it because he has not worn it outside.

Foreign Policy is a terrific journal.  It goes beyond the conventional wisdom in an effective manner:  Topics are well-chosen;  orientation is not as predictable as New Republic or tendentious as an academic journal.  Good links and bibliography.  Stimulating arguments and perspectives.  I enjoy it; recommend it; and often give subscriptions to friends	pos
This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness	neg
I love this band and have all the rest of their cds	neg

I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler.

It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it	neg
 I got this movie in a three DVD pack from a local dealer, it came along with the movies Eaten Alive and Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.  I'd have to say that all three movies were worth the $15 dollars I spent on the three-pack.  The movie, Jungle Holocaust, is an adventure movie in a different spin.  I dont really consider this a horror movie, at least in the conventional sense.  The movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography, the storyline is interesting and the acting and er...scenes...are engrossing (to use a phrase).  What I would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme...a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings.  Communications are not what you would get off the local street corner, worldviews are nonexistent (at least to the tribe in this film), so there is no connection except savagery.  Maybe this movie would have a greater tie with Golding's "Lord of the Flies."  A fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we, especially in first world countries like the US, have forgotten about.  I would suggest "End of the Spear" as a Christian look at examining these prehistoric people.  That film isn't a horror film, it is a Christian film, but it is (as I am a Christian) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory. 	pos
Very seldom do I give up on a book; I gave up on this one after several attempts to finish.  I have read Barbara Delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books.

This workout is short but you will feel "worked out" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.

My Xbox was getting the red rings of death, figured this was most likely due to overheating, so I bought this thing. Not only did it not fix any of my troubles, I was having more.

This magazine is published every month. For me it's a big event. I can't wait to finger though the pages, look at the articles, and read the columns from my favorite writers like Molly Ivans. If you are a conservative this magazine is not for you but if you are a moderate, or some where on the left you will love this magazine! Senator Robert Lafollette R-WI originally founded it. He ran for president in 1924 under the Progressive party (which has since died out). He received 4,826,471 popular votes and 13 electoral votes. It was one of the first publications ever to publish the writings of  Martian Luther King and has since been a strong voice against the war in Iraq. This magazine should be cherished for being well progressive.	pos
I watched Blow Out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity.  I ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice, plus he did seem sincere when formulating, etc.  I have blonde hair, color treated, thick, long lengths.

You can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair.  Then, the conditioner,  with it's exotic fragrance,  is the most wonderful conditioning treatment I've ever used.  My hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo & conditioner.  I'll use it as long as it's available to me	pos

Get yourself a can of "photoblocker" and this license plate or risk being victimized by some deputy do-right and his shiny new toy: the traffic camera. Rumor has it that several class-action suits are underway while others have been won against these cameras. I lost $180 in tickets to the fiefdom of Chicago before installing this system. The tinted lense covers your plate and protects you from losing your tag. My tag has been stolen once and weather took another during the past 4 years. The solution I chose was a couple of coats of photoblocker with the smoke cover lense over the top; I tried to get a polarizing sheet from 3M but they would not sell it to me because most states are making these defenses illegal. The principle of operation is simple: the photoblocker reflects back the light from the camera flash, the smoky lense deadens some of that reflection but obscures it (like a polarizing sheet)making it even harder to read than with the photoblocker alone. Also, by itself, the lense will make it a little harder to see your numbers in daylight. By law, your numbers must be visible but there is no scientific minimum so anything you can do to inconvenience the cops will benefit you.  ---  --- FYI: photoblocker works because the traffic cameras need the flash. It is all about shutter speed. To capture a clear picture of a moving object --obviously, you are racing through a stop sign-- you must have a flash. If you tried without the flash the shutter speed would be too slow to catch anything but a blur. By sending a pulse of reflected light you cause the photo to be over-exposed. One of the makers of the traffic camera says that all they have to do is re-develop the picture. Perhaps, but I seem to remember you would need to develop two pictures and put together the photos. This seems like a lot of trouble for a police department and may even require re-programming the software for their digital cameras. They probably won't bother: there are lot of people without counter-measures and the cameras costs them a fortune anyway. ---   ---  --- If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks	pos
L'Occitane combined their famous lavender note with touches of peach, marigold and freesia to create a lovely, fresh and relaxing scent.  It's a nice one to wear before bed, too, not overpowering.  In the summer, I look for fragrances that contain natural notes mosquitoes do not care for and lavender is one of them.  The peach note in some fragrances also turns funky on my skin, but I have not had this problem with Eau de Recolte Bleue.  I prefer this over their Lavender Harvest fragrance, which I think would smell better on men (JMOP.) ---  --- Here is a description from their website: ---  --- "Eau de la Récolte Bleue exudes all the pleasures of Provence. Both fresh and as light as air, it captures the celebratory feel of the Lavender Harvest. ---  --- Composed from a blend of the green scent of leaves and A.O.C. Lavender essential oil, Eau de la Récolte Bleue is accompanied by the delicate notes of freesia, marigold and frosted peach. Woody and musky aromas then leave a lingering and sensual, fragrant trail." ---  --- All in all, I find this soft, gentle and thoroughly wearable.  Especially enjoy it on a summer evening.   --- 	pos

Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80. --- I used Olympus E-500 to take lots vivid color pictures that I love very much, but no water resistance and no second Display window, also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable. Same thing happen to Canon XTi, no water resistance and no second Display window make it little hard to use when you need to change settings. The Nikon D80 is a great camera but also have no water resistance and shake reducer build in on camera, the color tone of D80 isn't the kind that I would love. Finally I bought Pentax K10D, the feeling of the body,the water resistance, shake reducer,auto dust remove,vivid color tone,etc...makes me feel the K10D is the way to go.

Everyone uses office.  Everyone is familiar with office.  So why did MS change the interface to make it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get anything done?  I am computer savy (I'm an engineer) and I find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating.  Worst of all there is NO way to go back to the "old" drop down menu system.  It honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word/powerpoint because they've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons.  MS claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you're familiar with the ribbons.  I don't know/care whether that's true or not.  The learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new UI is immense.  So much so that the time investment to become proficient FAR FAR FAR out ways any "increase" in productivity....not to mention that it's overpriced.  Offce 2003 is a far superior product	neg

The Four Seasons have always been one of my favorite groups. I think Frankie Valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence, and the rest of the group had harmonies that only The Beach Boys could match. nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection. Up until now, I always felt the best way to obtain all the Four Seasons' best songs was by getting Rhino's single disc "The Very Best Of The Four Seasons". Well, I was wrong. "In Season: The Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons Anthology" is the definitve Four Seasons collection. ---  --- On these two discs, you find all the essential Four Seasons songs, including "Sherry", "Big Girls Don't Cry", "Walk Like A Man", "Dawn (Go Away)", "Rag Doll", "Let's Hang On (To What We've Got)", "Working My Way Back To You", "Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)", "Tell It To The Rain" (an often forgotten Top 10 hit and my favorite Four Seasons song ever), "Who Loves You" and "December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)". But the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities, including many songs that were either album tracks, uncharted singles or Frankie Vali solo singles. Plus, you get it for about $25.00, which I consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs.  ---  --- The 30+ page booklet is excellent, filled with track information (chart positions, etc.), rare photos and an excellent essay written by Pat Sierchio. This is an absolute must have	pos

This is why I bought the phone, now I am never without a camera. The flash is good and strong, so it takes great pictures with good focus. ---  --- I don't really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod. I will not comment on this feature. However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldn't allow me to use mp3s as ringtones. I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phone's fault though.

I give this movie an "A" for "avoid."  Definitely the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure to watch (and yes, I've seen "Angel Eyes" so I do have a valid point of reference).  Chevy plays a guy makin' bacon with Farrah Fawcett (yes, I did just vomit) while Jonathon Taylor "Buy a Last Name" Thomas plays the petulant little crapface son who is anti-Chevy from the start (let's face it, who isn't?) and makes his life a living hell.  The acting is atrocious, the characters are poorly developed and hideously predictable, Farrah's nose appears poised to melt off at a moment's notice, and that little brat from "Home Improvement" couldn't be more annoying.  There is only one moment that is midly amusing (when JTT names Chevy "squatting dog" as his Indian Guide name), but too bad I heard that punchline in a joke my dad told me in 1982.  This movie is so bad that when Chevy drives his SUV off a bridge while rushing home to fulfill a promise to JTT you actually find yourself praying he can't open the window to escape.  If you enjoy banging your head against a wall, eating glass shards, or applying a curling iron to your bare skin, this is the flick for you.  Otherwise it is pure, unadulterated waste that a coprophagic dog would even avoid.  Trust me, if you value your retinas, avoid, avoid, avoid	neg
Tears for Fears was not the average 80's pop band, even if they looked like it on the surfice. They used synthsizers, drum machines with a meliodic and hook laden sound. But the music itself was often melancholy and they brought up serious issues like family values like few contemporary bands at the time had the guts to sing about. Tears for Fears got their name from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy and they band consisted of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, two highschool friends from Bath, England. Roland was the writer of most songs during the career while they both were co-singing. Some of the music may sound a little dated today (this being released in 1983) but the touchy subjects they bring up are still present today.  ---  --- The opener and title track is a great pop song and at the same time a good introduction to what is coming, it's about children suffering without anyone noticing or caring. Tears for Fears trademark was mixing good pop with serious subjects and they really succeeded with that. "Mad World" was one of the big hits and recently covered by Gary Jules and taken back to the charts again as the sountrack for "Donnie Darko". The moody alternative song brings up the sad reality we're living in, a world without rules or morals and the people suffering from it. Excellent and haunting ballad. "Pale Shelter" was originally released in 1982 but failed to make it big on the charts, so the song was re-recorded, remixed and re-released and the result was a big hit even for "Pale Shelter". The song is slow paced and distinct with guitars, synthesizers and percussion. It brings up the lack of love some children get cause of bad parenthood. "Ideas As Opiates" is almost minimalistic, it basically only feauture percussion and slow piano sound, the lyrics are also sparse. "Memories Fade" is also a stripped and melancholy song, with it's haunting lyrics and saxophone it's one of this album's highlights. ---  ---  "Suffer Them Children" is a synth laden pop song about children with problems growing up cause they're ignored and not given too much love. Watch Me Bleed" got very strong lyrics "Heaven comes to he who waits/ But I know Im getting nowhere/ And all the deeds of yesterday --- /Have really helped to pave my way" and is overall another great pop/rock song. "Change" was one of three big hits on this album, it got a trademark marimba sound and a great hook which paved the way to the charts. The song is focusing on the destructive behavior of a loved one. "The Prisoner" is the darkest of songs with some very strong lyrics and arrangements suited for a horror film, the lyrics are sparse and they're almost whispered. The last song is called "Start of a Breakdown" feautures a catchy synthesizer sound and meliodic percussion. Why this song was not released as single is beyond me, but it's one of the best songs. This remastered version  feauture remixed of Pale Shelter", "Mad World" and "Change and the non-album song "The Way You Are" is present. It's another fantastic song by the way. Uptempo with great percussion arrangements. Nice it was added. ---  --- Overall, Tears for Fears magnificient debut was one of the most daring and thoughtful albums of the 80's. It's equally intellegent and beautiful full of good lyrics and great arrangements. With this remastered version you get better sound + bonus tracks and the non album song "The Way You Are". Some of the songs may sounds a little dated today, considering all the new equipment used in today's music, but the lyrics and subjects they brought up are just as present in today's society. This album may get a little too personal and the lyrics get frightening when you listen closely to them at times, however if you're a music fan that likes smart lyrics and lyrics that make sense then this is something for you. It's a concept album and it very thoughtful and sincere. One of the greatest debuts of the 80's, let alone albums.	pos

We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes.  It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad.  It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches.  It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban.   We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes.  It is more challenging to get the BMXs on.  One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike, then tilt it back up for the other three.   Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway.

Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would! 	neg

SPOILER ALERT ---  ---  --- The ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan, the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond, enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she shows some very appealing nipples.  ---  --- The 1968 version, of which this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just yearn to see Brosnan and Russo "get it on." Dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible. ---  --- Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it clear he can do so, under the noses of   security guards, police, and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her employer a bundle.  ---  --- What we have here is a film with clever dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never really, you know, works. But I digress. ---  --- Dennis Leary has a character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises Russo's Banning. As we watch her slowly spiral out of control, risking her job and her reputation, we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether Russo will fall for him, or Brosnan. Duh. ---  --- The film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up. This can be confusing, but who cares? All we have to do is wait for their next move, the next gorgeous set, the next revealing love scene. ---  --- The Thomas Crown Affair will keep both men and women interested, for all the usual reasons. ---  --- It is a film worth watching, and a great date flick	pos

I needed a lens hood for my 50mm lens and paying $25 for a hood on a $75 lens might seem ridiculous. However, that might be because the $75 lens is so inexpensive. If the lens was $250 then paying an extra 10% might not seem too bad.  I just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for $100 and that's good for a terrific prime lens and its hood.   ---  --- However, please note: the lens hood is rather shallow (1 star reduction) and it is a screw-on two piece kit (1 star reduction). One piece is the adaptor that screws-on where the filters normally go (UV Filter) in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor. The adaptor ring retains the same 52mm rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor. ---  --- (1 Bonus Star) Because $100 is still a bargain for a 50mm, f1.8, super fast, super sharp, super clear, light weight beginner lens and hood kit! ---  --- I hope this helps rather than confuse. :)	pos
I have progressively become more and more disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's books in the past decade. Her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- Southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. Blessedly, "Whisker of Evil" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. Rita Mae Brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of Virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only Virginians understand these things. That's just simply not true. ---  --- That said, there were some delightful aspects of "Whisker of Evil" -- the mystery itself was great, the animal characters were adorable as ever, and I loved learning more about Harry as a person and what makes her tick. Her quitting the post office was a great (and very unexpected) twist. I liked reading more about her home and her relationships. However, the stultifying minutiae of horse bloodlines was beyond me; was this directed at a heretofore-unknown segment of Rita Mae Brown's fan base? It was so out of context in this book; certain details contributed to the horses' relationships to one another, but she took it way too far and I found myself skipping pages. As well, I almost threw the book across the room when I came across a line that stated in so many words that only Virginians have manners. This is a common theme of Ms. Brown's and it is quite frankly offensive. There is a big, big world outside of Virginia -- Rita Mae Brown should know this, she has lived in it -- but her books and characters have become so parochial, insular and snobbish that it is an insult to those of us who do live elsewhere in that big world. I would have thought these kinds of statements were tongue-in-cheek if it wasn't such a recurring theme in so many of her books over the past decade. Enough already about Southern manners (a biased perception at best), ancestor worship, bloodlines (human and horse), and foxhunting.  ---  --- Whatever happened to characters like Celeste Chalfonte	neg
check out page 67 of the book for a basic reason why this book is useless: --- an entire page of a ftp session downloading openldap.  huh?  How is this helpful?  getting the right version of BerkeleyDB and installing it, or installing and configuring OpenSSL would have been far more helpful to me. --- This is another book composed mostly of cut 'n paste from the man pages, header files and varous scripts you can find with google. --- Discussion on basic topics such as replication skips over key steps, examples for many issues are not provided or are hidden in the book.  I use LDAP at work and I used the O'Reilly book to instal, configure and use OpenLDAP.  I have yet to find a question that Deploying OpenLDAP can answer that I can't get faster with google	neg
There are much better products by LUSH. ---  --- I got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with LUSH's Trichomania solid shampoo.  At first I really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  I'm not sure if it was the Trichomania or the Coolaulin, but I gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  The smell wasn't my favorite either (I'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner. ---  --- As for me, I will stick to American Cream and Rehab. ---  --- **UPDATE** --- December 21, 2005 --- I tried the Coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  I'm not sure what happened the first time I tried it, but it was fine this time around.  I'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (American Cream!!), but I do want to add on TWO stars and make the rating *~*FOUR STARS*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft	neg
The Vista set up is nice but is buggy and incompatible with a lot of games and upgrades	neg
It is a simple device, and it is easy to imagine enhancements that would improve it, yet it is as advertised and does just what I wanted it to do. It sits in a shallow cardboard box between the seats of my old Nissan where it is perfectly level and will not shift around while I'm driving, so I set it up just before I leave for work. I work close to my home, so my morning commute is about ten minutes, about the time it takes the Wagan to brew my coffee. A larger cup with a brew-through lid would make it safer for use while the car is in motion, which the manufacturer recommends against, still I am very happy with it and have no complaints.	pos

The title gets it right - this is a very fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here.

I was eager to try the Sugar Blend for Baking.  I noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact.

I really love Bones.  It has everything: suspense, drama, humor, pretty people, fun storylines.  I have yet to miss an episode, and even into Season 2 this is probably my favorite.  It adds depth to all of the characters.  Also, the winter holidays are my favorite time of year.  I like holidays that are about what is good in the world.  Bones is about people standing for the good in humanity even though they explore the very worst every day.  I cry through half this episode, but in a completely good way.  Buy, watch it, love it.  But watch it with a friend if you don't want to cry alone.  So moving, great performances by the whole cast.  Emily Deschanel was powerful in this one, she brings real vulnerability to Brennan here.  David Boreanaz, as always the perfect sympathetic hero, loveably old-fashioned. Cute, funny moments.  Touching, poignant moments.  This really is the best of what is great about Bones	pos
I have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and I have become very skeptical of much of its advice.  This advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the US Dairy Industry (there is always at least one of those annoying "got milk" ads) and not surprisingly, every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese).  However having read many books on nutrition, it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the The China Study by Colin Campbell, an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the US dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products.  It is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks.  The magazine also appears to be very similar to Prevention magazine which I also have subscribed to and I would make the same criticism of.  My advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent "Berkeley Wellness Letter" that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the US Dairy Industry	neg

I bought this item last month from Amazon.com for $149. I thought it is using some kind of hand-like massage motors, and not those vibration motors. When the item arrived and I setup, I found out they are using the vibration motors! A little disappointed I am. But I use it, it is not bad if you don't mind the vibration motors. The heat feature is great. However, the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting position isn't holding well. The leather-like material really feels like a lether. The vibration really vibrates the whole floor, so I suggest to put on carpetted areas only. I personally like the hand-like massage chair better. But this $149 chair is worth the price. Others would sell for over $300	pos
I became a committed user of OneNote in its orginal version in 2003. The new 2007 version seems to improve somewhat on this product's functionality.

I recommend that people who collect information in one form or another give OneNote a try.	pos
I thought these looked so cute when they came out, so I put it on my wishlist last year. From Day one, it has never worked right. Sometimes it just shuts off on it's own. Of course when you turn it back on you have to start at 88.9 again. There is no visible tuner, just a tiny hard button that hurts your finger when you press it. The antenna began getting rusty after a few months, finally this morning it broke off in my hand. I was able to stick it back in, but then wasn't able to tune a station. I turned it upside down and finally got something. ---  --- If you want hassle free, ease of use, and good quality, this is not for you.	neg
I bought the DVD hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on SNL. We had it recorded on VHS many MANY years ago and somehow lost it. But we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where Phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- "Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man" ... "Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie" ... "Hair Head!"  I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!!  ---  --- And it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety...They just weren't funny.  ---  --- On a positive note, there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the DVD that was so sweet, it brought me to tears. And the bonus featuring Phil's audition was quite interesting. But overall, I don't recommend it. 	neg
Their 4th album as a complete group (not counting the few album Havoc & Prode'je put out) is my least favorite of the 4 SCC albums I have (I don't have the one from 1992 or 2005), but it still gets itself a 4 star rating.  Out of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping; 4 are ok and the other 9 are good.  Like all their albums, guests are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs.  Production is mostly handled by Prode'je (as with all their albums) he does get a little help from Robert "Fonksta" Bacon & Tomie Mundie.

At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts. ---  --- The game is very easy. As a PSP player of Tekken:DR, complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play--especially ports that we're used to seeing on PSOne and PS2. With LocoRoco, you use 3 buttons during gameplay. The shoulder buttons (LEFT and RIGHT) are used to tilt, tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos, holding the circle button combines them, and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump. A lot easier said than done. A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http://www.us.playstation.com/locorocopcdemo. You must have v2.71 for this to work, I might add. ---  --- Besides a "career" mode, which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos, there are "mini-games" like a Mui-Mui Crane, Chuppa game, and more. You must collect a certain amount of bugs/pickories every game to play these games. Also, there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco. I haven't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature, I presume. By collecting MuiMuis in games, you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco. ---  --- Besides all of the gameplay features, a large soundtrack is full of bubbly, interesting, and catchy jingles with unique voices. While some find it annoying, it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head. LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on. MuiMuis do, as well. The graphics are 2D like Mario, which make loading times non-existant and shows off the capability of the PSP's high-performance graphics. ---  --- In the end, LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive, simple, and beautiful to look at. It is fitted only for the PSP, and it should. Additionally, the gameplay is excellent, pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters (like Moja, who attack you or Chuppa, who catapults you into hidden areas). It is clearly worth $40--clearly. ---  --- PROS- --- Intuitiveness and Simplicity: Easy to play, fitted for the PSP --- Shows off PSP Graphic Capabilities: Beautiful to look at --- Different Maps, Characters, Colors: Very unique and fresh --- Not a Port or Re-creation/compliation: A completely original game --- No Long Loading Times: 2D graphics prevents this --- Mini-Games: Lets you take a break from main gameplay ---  --- CONS- --- Longevity: Only 40 levels makes you wish for more... --- Should've Used Characters More: Some characters pop up once... --- You have to pay money made in career to access mini-games ---  --- 5/5: FUN --- 5/5: GRAPHICS --- 5/5: GAMEPLAY --- 4/5: PLAYABILITY --- 19/20: TOTA	pos

Most people will say that Episode One is their least favorite of all the Star Wars films.

I love to cook. I am not a professional by all means but I do enjoy the concept of preparing food. Other than tv, "Bon Appetit" is one of my main sources I refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. I have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. I have to admit I don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that I read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find.  These recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed. All in all, I still enjoy reading "Bon Appetit" and being inspired by the magazine	pos
My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection.  He enjoyed levels 1 & 2, but once we got to level 3 that was it!  Unless you have earned the nickname "Fast fingers" or "Fury Feet" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it.  I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.  Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the "Dance Levels" get harder from here, Good Luck!!	neg
This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such, it is great. This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. But when you need some light in an emergency, a little shaking and you have some light. It's starting to dim? Just shake it some more and voila, more light. You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help. --- I don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working. And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say, the light will last longer then people on here are saying. If my 6 year old niece can figure it out, I would think that adults could too. But, there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything.  --- This is an emergency, no battery SHAKE flashlight. I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself.  ---  --- You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles, campers, boats, kids rooms, etc. How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn't find new ones? This one has worked everytime I have uesd it. But then again, I do have common sense.  ---  --- This flashlight is Great!	pos

This model has been out for a long time. I like the look of the black more then the white or gold. The reason the watch loses one star is because the band. It looks great, but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year. The replacement band that Casio offers looks close the orginal, but not exactly the same. I lost one of these, and another was stolen. So the fact that I am on my third is a statement to how much I love this watch. I have been wearing it since about 1993	pos
This film is one big joke:  you have all the basics elements of romance (love at first sight, great passion, etc.) and gangster flicks (brutality, dagerous machinations, the mysterious don, etc.), but it is all done with the crudest humor. ---  --- It's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately "get" or you don't.

If you're a Strummer fan who is an historical completist then you'll want this disc.   Also, there are some really good tunes on here for anyone, particularly Joe's "Keys to Your Heart".  Some of the live material here is high quality and some is not.  This is likely not a CD you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh.  But, I'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as I've always wanted to hear it and as a Joe fanatic, I had to have it.  There's moments here that sound like a rough draft of JS and the Mescaleros, but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's with some great guitar solos.  If Joe had not been where UK punk started after this band there's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band.  I'm a huge Clash and Strummer fan, but I rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content	pos
i was very pleased with this product.  It is very good quality.  I was reluctant to order online without seeing it, but I was very pleased	pos
Note: If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this. (I'm giving you fair warning now, so don't complain about spoilers later). The only reason I'm mentioning the ending and the "big secret" is because I'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment I experienced when watching this movie.                        When I first walked into the theatre to see this, I couldn't have been more excited; after months of waiting, I'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time I saw it! The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)The story takes place in a small town in the 1800's. At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful. Despite the peaceful setting, however, we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community, something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from  being completely at ease. Every now and then, they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village; nobody ever ventures into it, and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it. Pretty soon, we find out why: according to the village elders, there are dangerous, hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain. These creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village (it attracts them). For years, the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding: as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, the monsters will not harm them. At one point,however, one of the creatures enters the village at night, leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack. While all this is happening, we (the audience) still don't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are. It was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end: There are NO MONSTERS IN THE WOODS.  When one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words "It's all a farce", I still couldn't believe what I was hearing; it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre! After months of anticipating this film, of expecting a truly scary thriller, and of trying to guess what the monsters really are, THERE ARE NO MONSTERS! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it. It got worse, though. The next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the "monsters". The villagers aren't really living in the 1840's; they're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve. Supposedly, the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people, but when tragedy struck their families, they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new (if extremely delusional) life. The story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth. They even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real! When the retarded boy died in the woods (still wearing the stupid costume), the leaders, rather than mourning him, remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures. I basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them. What parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie before; not only was it completely misleading, but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic (I'm sorry, but I have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it). Many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn't like it "don't get it". I assure you, I did get it, and I didn't like it anyway. I'm no fan of slasher films and I didn't expect this to be one, but I also don't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters. The two stars are for the cast and the filming. Better luck next time, guys	neg

I used one of these 24 inch extensions to cover a 90 inch space.  The Kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces (i.e. 72 inches total), so if you need extra length, you can purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions to customize your gate to any length.  The extension was easy to use and is very sturdy.  The gate looks uniformed and you cannot tell it is several separate pieces.  The only 'issue' is you have to connect the extensions to either the section w/the door (i.e. 24 inch section with the open/close swing door) or use it as an end piece.  I was not able to continously connect extensions to one another (not sure if I did this incorrectly or not.)  But nonetheless, the extension worked fine and I love my new gate	pos

First off, I usually just stick to rating & critiquing movies. But, every time I see an ad on this website for this Time/Warner (or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week) rag-mag I start to see red. ---  --- "Entertainment Weekly", which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho-hum of everyday life, has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash.    ---  --- Back in the summer of 89, "EW" was released and after I read a few issues, I decided to subscribe. I was instantly hooked (the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the Saturday before it would hit regular newstands) & I liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies, music, T.V., and video (that was later added in the mid-90's).  ---  --- The problem with the magazine started in the late 90's. I started to notice that "EW" would cover a big movie or event that hadn't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it, or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales.  ---  --- I also hate the damn lists that "EW" comes up with. The latest entitled "The top 100 most memorable movie lines" was a joke. These lists have always annoyed me, because I feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking. ---  --- The other & most important thing I noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review.  ---  --- Case in point, a few weeks ago I picked up the latest issue in which the movie "Catwoman" had been reviewed (I wasn't to sure if it was Gleiberman or Shwarzbaum that critiqued it).  ---  --- I first logged onto "Rotten Tomatoes.com" to see what percentile "Catwoman" recieved from the nation's critics.  --- Out of roughly 115 reviews "Catwoman" only got 10% of the good reviews while the rest trashed it (a film needs, at least, to get a grade of 60 - 65% in order to place it as a fresh or good movie). That makes "Catwoman" the worst reviewed film, so far, for 2004. Yet, "EW" gave the film a B. What erkes me even more is that "Catwoman" is released by "Warner Bros.", the same company that owns the rights to the "Harry Potter" films, "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, & yes, the "WB" owns "Entertainment Weekly".  ---  --- Is "Warner Bros." trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular & lucrative magazine's?        ---  --- I'm not the only who has seen this developement. People have written in saying that there is favoritism among "Warner" products that are reviewed in the magazine. "EW", of course, hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews, possibly in fear of being fired (they will deny that also). ---  --- My only question to the reviewers at "Entertainment Weekly" is, "Whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull**it?"  ---  --- Or better yet, "What's it like to stand on a Democratic Podium?"	neg
There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype	neg

I think simply put, if you like Bob Dylan and just want to have fun with a movie, then you'll love it.

I was ecstatic when I received this magazine subscription as as gift. Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer	neg
Oprah Winfrey and Kevin Costner the leading medical researchers in America think this is a great break through. Well gee, if they like it you must too. There is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers "guarantee" that this works. After you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening. Well it probably is, in your psyche. If that and Kevin Costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead. Can't seem to find the "guarantee" on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you'll be the first to benefit	neg

This radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple, user-friendly set of controls.  Also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios.  I have the S-350, the model that the S-350DL replaces.  For general world band programme listening, this radio is fantastic.  Outstanding speaker.  Easy to read digital display includes backlight.  Includes attenuator.  Clock can be set to 24 hour time.  Easy to carry anywhere.  Robust antenna.  Does not support SSB tuning, which you would need to tune in Ham radio.  Same radio sold under Tescun name in other parts of the world	pos

This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant "homemaker". If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too	neg
This version of the old favorite is an interactive delight, engaging all the senses of reader and listener as they sing and play their way through the story.  Each page offers endless possibilities to captivate the interest and attention of the youngest "readers."  The progressive repetion of the song makes learning it fun and easy.  All the colorful digressions, especially the silly commentaries on each page, can lead to more fun & games. Wonderfully illustrated; sturdy pages	pos
This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more	neg

I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.    ---  --- I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version.  I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use. ---  --- I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.     ---  --- I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry.  The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase. 	neg
This is beautiful birdbath.  If placed on solid ground (walkway, concrete) it will be great. However, if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom.  A wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip.  However, it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright.  I am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch	pos

Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one.

Has anyone else experienced the following ?: Used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems, then have run into (so far) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months. After various attempts to narrow down the problem, I tracked it down to the blank CD-Rs. I had exactly the same problem occur with another brand, which was replaced with these TDKs. Is there some unwritten shelf life for blank CD-Rs or am I just unlucky?	neg
My son LOVES cars and trucks so this looked like it would be a big hit, but like the other reviewers, we have had to put this toy away because of all the injuries.  He used the handle to push it, but the toy is unbalanced, so any pressure on the back causes it to flip up and hit him in the face.  He's had several big bruises and one cut lip.   ---  --- Since posting this, I've spoken to a rep for Little Tykes. She said they would look into this toy a bit more and sent a replacement toy for my son to play with until he is able (if ever) to use the dump truck again. If you've had a problem with this truck, please call them so that they can get it on record	neg

My one star rating is for Amazon's service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received.  Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007.  I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days. ---  --- In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.  I don't understand why Amazon can't keep better track of their inventory	neg

This is a very thorough, very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the United States, and while it may not be as easily readable as, say, David McCullough's "Truman", it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works. If you're looking for a full-life biography of Monroe, one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure's life, this is an excellent choice. If you're looking for light reading with a historical basis, this is definitely NOT what you're looking for	pos

I have used the camera for three months, and absolutely love it! The pictures are crisp (even very close-ups), and the video feature is right up there. Sound pick-up is excellent. I have created two DVD's combining videos and still pictures. Folks have thought the quality was very good. ---  --- The battery life was rated very good, and I have found this to be true. I carry the camera with me nearly everywhere I go. People are impressed with the size. ---  --- Drawbacks? Because of its size, there are no connections from the camera to a computer, TV or battery charger. The docking station is small and lightweight. Because of the battery life, I have never been away from home long enough to need recharging. ---  --- I recommend the camera without reservations, and will look first to Casio in the future	pos

This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating	neg
We are loving this set!  Very cool dragons, a fun environment for characters to explore and fight in.  Extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering cauldron, tramcar on sloped tracks, erupting mountain top, opening dragon mouth, flapping dragon wings, firing cannon. ---  --- A little challenging to build, but the instructions are fairly clear.  Assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours.   ---  --- A few sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to put back together.  So far no pieces have broken. ---  --- Most important, this is a lot of fun to play with.  Over the past two days, our set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl.  A great toy for two kids to play with together, and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily playing by himself. ---  --- We wouldn't have paid the full retail price for this, but at $35 (Amazon discounted price), I think this is appropriate value. ---  --- 	pos
Incredible follow up to Rated R which I didn't think could be equaled and they did.  Flat out incredible songwriting, amazing vocal identity and muscianship at its best.  If you grew up in the 70's as I did and miss those albums that you would play constantly from beginning to end then this album is for you. "Go With The Flow" is one of the greatest rock singles of all time but you won't be skipping any songs on this disc. Baby Boomers rejoice, rock is back	pos
I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child. I am stunned that this product is still on the market. while it is very cute, and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for. My daughter loved the look of this--- her first "big girl" bed. that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT! The metal rails that are to hold the bed together, and the matress in place, are not properly planned out. If you can even manage to get this bed built--- which is difficult, much more so than it seems at first---- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed. it is flimsy, poorly designed, dissapointing, and DANGEROUS. delta should be ashamed	neg

When I was little, my dad always said good things about this magazine.  My attitude was always "I'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more" - I mean, c'mon, it's a history magazine.  I was absolutely wrong.  I picked up this magazine one day and I was hooked.  I would say that American Heritage has found its way to make history interesting.  One way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles.  On the second thought, I should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not.  This magazine keeps me awake - sometimes I would put my paper/project aside just so that I could finish my copy in one sitting.  It's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months.  American Heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself	pos

The Boston based author, Dennis Lehane, wrote a great detective story with a social background so great, it is almost more important than the plot. "Mystic River" differs from Lehane's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer. ---  --- "Mystic River" is set in the fictional Boston suburb, called East Buckingham (the author explains it as an amalgamate of Dorchester, Charlestown and South Boston and it really feels like Dorchester), home mostly to white working class, with plenty of crime. I liked the background info especially since I could relate to it, knowing the area... ---  --- The first part, which is the base and explanation for later events, takes place in 1975, when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car, and although he comes back after four days, his life as well as his friends' is changed forever. The ways of the boys soon part, Dave (the boy taken by the men) lives a quiet life, has a wife and a son, and likes his memories of being a football player in high school. Jimmy, the "bad boy", after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage, second wife and their two daughters. The third boy, college-educated Sean, becomes a policeman. ---  --- When Jimmy's beautiful daughter, Katie, is found murdered in the park after a night out Dave comes home covered in blood, Sean gets assigned to the case. There are many leads to different people... But the case is difficult. Meanwhile, Jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own. ---  --- The plot is very good until the end, and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate. The characters are very real, especially Jimmy and Sean, who are central to the plot. Their trauma after Dave's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways. They are complicated, multifaceted people, very well developed as literary characters. Some side protagonists, depicting perhaps types rather than individuals (Bobby, Roman, the Savage brothers, Sergeant Whitey), are very good. I was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment, but also food for thought.  ---  --- The movie based on "Mystic River" with Sean Penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time...	pos

I received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver. How nice that I can monitor my baby's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute!  The are two different channels, so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off. Sometiems it's also just a matter or re-positioning the monitor to resolve the noise.  --- We were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls, but switching to channel B solved that.  --- I've used the Evenflo Whisper Connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied	pos

Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min.

It's awful. the S size is too big for me (My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says "size S fits 26-36")so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me. Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.	neg
Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called "Love Is Always  Seventeen," which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   "Guitar Man," and "Aubrey" were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  "Tecolote" is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  "Didn't Even Know Her  Name" is a poignant lost love song; "Welcome to the Music"  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing "Picture in My Mind."  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad "Bread" album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies	pos
I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too  high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter.

The Pros:  ---  --- -You can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it's adhesive. ---  --- -It allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well. ---  --- -Doesn't prohibit any functions of the ipod (i.e. sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on) ---  --- The Cons: ---  --- -Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. I've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways, and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime, especially on the screen.  ---  --- -If the screen is not lit up, all you can see is bubbles on the screen. ---   --- -It doesn't do the ipod justice, because it looks so cheap when applied. ---  --- -After 2 days with this product I'm already looking to replace it. 	neg

i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective-like game.  unfortunately, this game is very kid-like.  here's an example.  the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy.  these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book.  i easily got all of them except 1, meaning i couldn't progress past this point.  no problem for me, because by this time i didn't want to!  i'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups.	neg
When I saw that most of the critical parts, the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic, I told my wife "this isn't going to last long." ---  --- In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke.  A simple metal pin, instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference. ---  --- I also just noticed in these "customer reviews" that right after someone posts a negative review, a positive albeit anonymous review is posted.  That always makes me wonder	neg
I was 5 minutes early getting out of the house to go to work one morning so I decided I could stop by a coffee shop and get a mocha. On my way back to my car the mocha "splooshed" out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all over my sweater...naturally, that day it was a white silk knit sweater. So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains, and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change. ---  --- The cafe was next to a supermarket so I decided to go buy a Tide to Go pen and give it a try. I applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the stain lightened noticeably. I was a bit worried because after treatment there were still light tan stains visible, but after blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while wearing for about half an hour, there was no hint that any mocha had ever touched my sweater. ---  --- The cleansing agent also gets points for not damaging my silk sweater, despite the fact I was rubbing the product in fairly vigorously (out of desperation...I was going to be late for work!) ---  --- I'm not sure how it would work on other stains but I will keep one in my purse from now on. On the packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best on, and which it will be less effective on. From other reviews this will not work so well on some common food stains, so that's why I'm giving 4 stars and not 5. ---  --- Another minor concern is the warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact with direct sunlight. It doesn't say what will happen if you allow saturated fabric to see sunlight. Perhaps there is the potential for color/fabric damage	pos
This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways.  I liked to idea, but just doesn't work.  This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round.  The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck".  We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store.  (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.	neg
I have now seen about twenty Asian horror films, and this series definitely ranks among the best.  I have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a Disney romance.  Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent.  This film maker has something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.   ---  --- In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this series	pos

I have a 02 Dodge Intrepid plus a 05 Chrysler Pacifica, I was a little hesitant to go under my vehicle's at first but from multiple test try's (Up & Down) you can tell they are built well and can hold the weight. I'm 354lbs and had no problems going under, My Intrepid transmission shifter cable broke and putting a new one on was a breeze thanks to the ramps, I also change my transmission fluid and filter. personally I love the ramps, the fact they are lightweight and strong  makes them a keeper. I'm saving so much money because of the ramps, no more going to the dealership for over priced oil changes (LOL) I saved $200 putting the new shifter cable on my Intrepid. THE RAMPS ARE AWESOME..	pos
I agree with the comments about the taste and size.  Personally I think someone should look into the false advertising.  On the preztel kit, which is also a "4 pack", you only get two pretzels.  One of the packs is salt and another is glaze.  Then you get two packs of some pretzel dough.  These pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine. ---  --- Total rip-off.  Hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff	neg

In our pursuit for ultimate baby items, the infant carseat topped our list. What's more important than the safety of your first child, especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving?  ---  --- Our search led us to this Graco carseat, and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a Christmas gift, just before our daughter's birth in January. ---  --- The seat is fairly attractive, but its good points stop there.  ---  --- It's a bear to install. Not because it's complicated, but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man (or a woman, unlike myself certainly) to install the base. We ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might, and then huffed and puffed and told us "That should be in there real good, now." We examined it, and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car, and he replied, "Oh they all do that, that's normal." --- Unsure, but with the safety rating to back it, we continued to use it.  ---  --- Throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment. Lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat (we have 3 4-door sedans, a 1992 Subaru Legacy, an 80-something Oldsmobile, and my mom's 2006 Saturn Ion. With the seat already in the car, it's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once - for me. My husband simply can't put her in with the carseat already in the car.  ---  --- Not to mention that, the seat - while installed in the car - has never felt especially stable, with the exception of my mom's Ion, which has the latch system. Of course, the drawback of the Ion is that my 6'1" husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard. ---  --- Then, in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we're driving. Literally, go around a curve, look back, and her seat's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car. My daughter is 8.5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat. We've checked the belts that secure the seat, pulled with all our might, and the seat continues to malfuction. This is a safety issue if I've ever seen one. With enough force, she could end up directly on her side, say the force of a side impact in an accident. Upon closer inspection, I shouldn't be altogether shocked. The base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits. Sort of like a wine glass, I suppose - so it's top heavy, and likely the heavier the load on top, the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation. ---  --- Needless to say, we'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately. As for the Snugride, I would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it. I'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system, and I'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system. In hindsight I wish I had shopped around a bit more.	neg

I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o. ---  --- Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us. ---  --- He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.  ---  --- What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it. ---  --- Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.  ---  --- Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e	neg

They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.   ---  --- Charlie Sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war.  This seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie.  He finds out alright.  Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.  He cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked.  The supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here.  Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.  It has stood the test of time and never fails when I want to see a good movie.   ---  --- I just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.  It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film.  There is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was mroe than glad I got the special edition.  You would nto believe what the actors went through!  It is a great making of. 	pos

When we traveled in Belgium some years ago, we were constantly tempted by chocolate.  There was a Godiva store on every corner with uniform overstuffed waxy tasting chocolates.  Someone suggested we try Leonidas, and it was a revelation!! Half the  price of Godiva's chocolates and lightyears more flavorful and more like the artisanal chocolates that are so popular now.  The flavors were more interesting, the finish more refined, and the dark chocolate more full of cocoa bitterness and depth.  Leonidas is IT as far as Belgian chocolates are concerned	pos

I rented this game for my 3 year old.  Who loves the movie.  He tried to play it.  He like it.  I tried to play it & got to the dancing part.  I couldn't get past it.  I tried for 5 days.

These look great with jeans, though I'm not a fan with skirts. I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size. I normally wear a 9, and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide, but these I found the 8.5WW fits perfectly - go figure. Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!	pos
*** Spoiler Warning - this review might reveal surprises in the movie *** ---  --- First off for a frame of reference, I'm a 30-year old male and a sucker for Disney movies in general. ---  --- When this movie came and went to the theatres in a flash, I heard so much bad about it, how it was the worst Disney movie ever, that I actually didn't go see it in the theatre. I regret that now. First time I actually saw this movie was on a 14-hour flight from Los Angeles to London, and I fell heads over heels in love with it! ---  --- I adored the original Novel "Treasure Island", and I believe that Treasure Planet lives up to it. The central theme of Treasure Planet, in my mind, is the boy, Jim, who grows up with only a vague recollection of his father who in the movie appears like a shadow in Jim's faded childhood memories. ---  --- I think this particular "flashback" scene was very powerful, it featured the absolutely brilliant "I'm still here" track by Johnny Rzesnik, and led the viewer to fully understand Jim's childhood, and to share his teenage frustration and delinquency that stems from his father abandoning the young Jim and his mother. Possibly, I might a bit biased in this respect, since I can strongly identify with this situation as my own father was "married to the sea" when I grew up, and i can admit that i blubbered like a baby during the flashback sequence. ---  --- This is right in line with the core message of the film. A young, reckless and frustrated boy who is taken under the wing of the Old Salt, who becomes his new father figure. He learns how to take orders, work hard, grow, face adversity, and eventually become a man by making tough choices. An excellent message in this day and age, if you ask me. ---  --- I also loved the theme the producers chose. A type of anachronistic retro-futuristic design, where we in the future still use old, creaking, wooden, pirate ships, but with ultra futuristic systems. The movie also suspends the viewer from reality in many flavorful ways - for instance when the spaceship travels through the universe, it encounters a pod of whales. Or how Jim takes a dhingy "comet surfing". ---  --- I think this film provides excellent entertainment, suspense and has a great message for kids. But as an adult, I think I also got a kick out of this GREAT and CLEARLY UNDERRATED Disney flick. ---  --- SEE IT	pos

This product is very easy to install and use. In couple of minutes, I was able to set it up.

I can't wait to see the original film again. I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Yes, I know that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide. Nevertheless I love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence. Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being blasted with an Arctic blizzard. The hardships of an Arctic existence were beautifully photographed	pos
This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well. The build is solid (metal construction). The glass is also descent quality.  ---  --- About the performance, it absorbs some UV light. The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable, probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me.  ---  --- Now, about the one problem which is the internal reflection. I've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting. I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light/night situation. The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong/bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure (the surrounding environment). To put it in example (which hopefully is easier to understand), when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection. as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides/corner of the picture (and not in the center of the picture), the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear (if you move the light far enough from the center). And if the light isn't too bright/contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection. but of course most of the time, a lamp at nightime is often very bright. But the point that I'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time.  ---  --- Additionally, the internal reflection isn't only happening at night. it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example. basically same rule as above, on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area, and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side/dissapear (also depending the angle). But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations.  ---  --- Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation (which is not hard to do).  ---  --- I'm actually not a fan of lens filter (any filter) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object, but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens. And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens yet.  ---  --- I use this filter on my 50mm f/1.8D lens and on my 18-55mm lens. 	pos
Amazon and this company are NIGHTMARES.  I ordered this scale a month ago, and the expected ship date keeps changing.  I finally called Amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever.  He was no help at all.

Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat, shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are growing up and preparing to enter the world. ---  --- Lana Turner has never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams.  ---  --- One day at Coney Island, Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore), whom Lora mistakes for the maid.  When told by her that she's the mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child.  ---  --- The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage. Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night.  ---  --- At the same time, Lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white. ---  --- Imitation of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get.  Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization, but has trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous.  ---  --- Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's ultimate paradox. ---  --- Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them.  ---  --- Lora gets her career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother.  ---  --- Under Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring.  ---  --- The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost.

After reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the PSC-55, I was still undecided on a case for my Canon SD630.  So, I purchased both to see for myself which one would work.  Because red is my favorite color, I really wanted the red case to fit (PSC-90).  The camera will fit in the case, but it's a VERY tight fit.  I had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close.  The PSC-55 is still a very snug fit, but allows for some extra breathing room which I feel is better for the safety of the camera. ---  --- In addition, here's something to consider if you're deciding between the two cases: the inside lining of the PSC-90 is more of a rigid nylon material, while the lining of the PSC-55 is a softer felt material.  The case overall is still rigid, but I like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining.  Based on that alone, I'm going with the PSC-55 - I feel that this will be more friendly to the 3" screen on the SD630. ---  --- Both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive - I'm pleased with the Canon brand	pos
I finally got a DS and one of the first "older" games I tried to hunt down for this wonderful system was Phoenix Wright.  I've been "Jonesing" for this game for awhile now.  It's unique and entertaining.  The choices for the court sections can be kind of linear but it's too much fun to not "love" this title. ---  --- This is the type of game that makes the DS so unique and proud to say that "I own this system".  More games should take note and follow in it's footsteps.  This is a must buy for any DS library. ---  --- Other titles in this type of catagory that are must buys are: Trauma Center and Trace Memory. ---  --- This system was made for these types of games.  These games are why I will always trust in Nintendo for high quality and interesting games.  Game on!	pos

As others have noted, Arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball "My Man Godfrey" genre. It is an effectively told, outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies. ---  --- However, without Sir John Gielgud (a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood), the film's faults would be much more apparent. He elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection. He is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility. ---  --- And the title song is a classic. 	pos
This is without a doubt, one of Harrison Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it	pos

American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her	neg

I bought some of this for my husband last Christmas with a stovetop popcorn popper (the kind with the stir rod.)  Now it's our favorite brand of popcorn and our favorite way to make it.  The packages come with pre-measured oil & popping corn and you just cook it all up.  Each box has 5 bags.  Each bag makes a big bowl (?20 cups?)  We only have to add salt and we love the taste.  I highly recommend this with a stir rod popper, too--either the stovetop or electric kind. 	pos

Phil Jackson groupie and sometime ESPN.com writer Charley Rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life.  He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot.  However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down.  Rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc.  At times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight.  My roommates and I all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but Charley Rosen is a really weird guy	neg
I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations, but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance. When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end	neg
Another solid 70's band that faded into obscurity. The nice thing about living in Canada was that we got to see all of the minor as well as the major acts. Edward Bear fell between the two. The original members got together in the late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named Winnie. All of their hits are here as well as a cover of "Freedom for the Stallion" , a song that was also covered by "The Hues Corporation" and popularized by "Three Dog Night". Its mostly the type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from "The Last Song" to "Close Your Eyes" (I'm back again). A good middle of the road pop album to melt back the years	pos

A film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it. The story is simple enough, and not a whole lot happens. But there's no denying it, this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way. It's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers, and that the film doesn't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience. Not one charachter is stereotyped. They are human, and they'll probably remind you of people you know. I applaud this kind of a movie, and I wish there would be more of them	pos
Hey, have you ever played Caesar II from the 1990s? Yeah, well this game is basically a knock-off of that game with better graphics. And quite frankly, Caesar II was more fun. I don't see how CivCity has any point. You build your city and nothing interesting ever happens. There is no progression to the game that keeps it fresh.  ---  --- The makers intergrated technologies and wonders from the successful Civilization game series, but they are inconsequential in this game. These people should stick to what they are good at, the Civilization series, and leave city games to people who know how to do it.  ---  --- I've heard that a new installment of the Caesar series is out now, Caesar IV, and I haven't tried it, but it has to be better than CivCity Rome. This game is boring, don't pay any money for it.	neg
I love this carrier (I bought it in Feb 2007). My daughter loves it too. She can sleep very well in it.

I did not buy this from Amazon but sought it out here so I could vent about this outrageous product (that's 'outrageous' in its traditional meaning, that it outrages me). ---  --- This is two packets of colored dust, approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster.  Empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere, mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart.  My wife and I repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not. ---  --- The claim on the package is that it "Molds like Dough," obviously intended to remind us of Play-doh, but Play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can, in fact, be molded.  This material -- again attempting to compare itself to Play-doh -- states that it won't dry out.  Of course not!  It's dust!  It can't dry out, there's nothing drier than dust. ---  --- In case you're wondering I have no connection to Play-doh or its makers (I don't even know who does make it), I'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses Play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime.  Wrong	neg

Works great but I wish I could find it in stores.  The one RiteAid that does carry it, doesn't always have it in stock.  I also can not always find it in just any Rite Aid.  Some don't carry it at all...annoying!  ---  --- My daughter is the canker sore sufferer.  I did some research before I discovered Rembrandt, and found that the ingredient, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, found in almost all toothepastes is the culprate.  Rembrandt for Canker Sores does not contain this key ingredient.  Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is what makes our toothepaste foam.  My daughter hardly ever has anymore canker sore breakouts.  If she does, it seems to be from getting a cold.  Try and find a toothpaste without SLS...they aren't out there.  It would be nice to have some competition to bring the price down and be more readily available.  But all in all, I'm glad someone has made this product available, even if it's pricey and hard to find.	pos
Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the "roots of the roots of the roots" of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world	pos

Square and Disney coming together to bring us a video game turned out to really be a good move, I think.  Kingdom Hearts II is an improvement over the original.  Maybe not a big improvement, but enough to consider purchasing.   ---  --- The graphics are really good and the difficulty is unfortunately, sort of easy.  The game is really big and contains a MONSTER storyline so it's not like the easiness means you can blow through the game on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  It just means you won't have much trouble moving through the game.  I guess Axel was a fairly challenging fight.  Some other fights are sort of difficult, as well.   ---  --- I'm not entirely sure what to think about the idea of having to complete certain tasks in order to progress forward, but I guess it's not that big of a deal.  Worth buying?  Absolutely	pos

This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.   ---  --- Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her. ---  --- As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.   ---  --- As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!  ---  --- Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!  ---  --- There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.   ---  --- In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    --- In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.   ---  --- Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.  ---  --- If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human. --- 	neg

This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals. ---  --- Two solid tech house tracks follow, especially Touane's snappy track Bassic, and it's right into the gritty, churning, techno sound of Thomas Schumacher's incredible track Rotor.  The mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7, which I feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix.  It's not bad, it's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking.  It's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row, and right after the melodic Freefall, it's into Tiefschwarz's own remix of a Depeche Mode track.  This is the only other slight miss in the mix for me, as I feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes, and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix.  Another solid melodic track is next, and we end with the dubbed out vocals of Kate Wax. ---  --- Overall, it's an exciting tech house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks, with not a bad one in sight, and very few dips in the scorching pace of one, very sound, top to bottom mix.  Do not miss picking this one up, as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year	pos

My son's best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son's regular RC boat. The hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable. It hovered OK on water, but couldn't handle sand or concrete. The "skirt" slipped out of its track a couple times (despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could), filling with water - the foam inside it didn't prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave (even in good shape it couldn't handle waves like the other boat.) The thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now. Big disapointment. It was somewhat fun while it worked, the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys, but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one.	neg

"Shampoo" is probably the most sophisticated sex comedy ever made in this country. It's a very clear-eyed (and very funny) look at how love and lust get inextricably mixed up with up with power, money, position, and politics. Of course, contrary to almost every critique posted here, George (Warren Beatty), the philandering Beverly Hills hairdresser, is the primary victim of the rules of the game, late-60s Southern California-style. Unlike the protagonist of the great Renoir movie, George doesn't end up dead, but he's left alone, abandoned by all the women he's bedded, looking like a naive fool. And that's George's sin--he's an uncynical romantic in a world that doesn't know the difference between felt emotion and deliberate calculation. He sleeps with women because he genuinely likes them. For him, taking a woman to bed is an extension of doing her hair--it's an intimate act in which he makes her look and feel better. All the other characters in the movie use sex as part of a larger plan--they each have some separate goal on their mind, which they achieve in one way or another, and George is left behind with his silly emotional and sexual vulnerabiliy. He's Don Giovanni in reverse--the boy who can't say no because he actually gives a damn--and he pays a steep price for his availability. Playing a slightly out of it dupe, Beatty has never been better or more dazzlingly glamorous. And he's surrounded by a flawless ensemble cast--Lee Grant is simply astonishing as a deceived and deceiving Beverly Hills matron, and Julie Christie, in her flared pants and mini skirts, is peerlessy sexy as the 1968 version of a Rodeo Drive courtesan. Thanks to Robert Towne,  "Shampoo" also has some of the most natural, unforced, yet revealing dialog ever heard in an American movie--nothing is stylized or italicized, but every nonchalant remark hits target like a polished Wilde epigram.

I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it. ---  --- Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims	neg

Well, here we are.  One of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90's, "Lifeforms" is true sonic adventure.  This is obviously some of the best work that FSOL ever did.  "Lifeforms" is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together, interchanged and meshed.  For ambient work, it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace.  There is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs, despite their being ambient.  It is very original, I praise originality in music.

While many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare, there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted, yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror.  ---  --- In my more than four decades on this planet, there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief, disgust and abhorrence that I actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing. It was a film so onerous, pointless and unfunny, that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time, money and talent in the history of Western Civilization. That film is "Cabin Boy."  ---  --- To some, "Cabin Boy" may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening's entertainment, assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper. Imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich. That's the kind of inventive, knee-slapping, laugh-out-loud fun you'll find in "Cabin Boy."   ---  --- Having some respect for Chris Elliott's work on the old Letterman Show on NBC, I was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor. If it doesn't induce deep REM sleep, "Cabin Boy" will surely leave you either angry or depressed. One would venture to guess these were not the results Elliott intended.  ---  --- Letterman's genius-level cameo notwithstanding, "Cabin Boy" is about as funny as a prostate exam...without the "local" and the lube.  	neg

I have a 32" LCD mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so I always try to keep it closer to the wall, but every time I come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees. This hasn't caused any problems and I'm sure this is well within its design strength.  ---  --- Highly Reccommended	pos
Stretches to fit you exactly.  The smooth fabric holds everything in place.  Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy.  Highly recommended	pos

I wanted a new computer, so a couple months ago I ordered an HP computer that happened to have Vista on it.  I thought, "oh great, I'll get the newest OS as well"... major mistake. ---  --- 1. Didn't work with my perhipherals, including my scanner and an HP PRINTER.  For god's sake, the COMPUTER'S AN HP, why won't it work with an HP printer!?  If they knew the drivers for perhipherals weren't ready, why the did they release the OS and force us to buy it? ---  --- 2. Annoying security feautres, constantly asking permissions to install software.  Just like the Apple ads-- a total joke. ---  --- 3. After struggling with the damn thing for 2 days, I decided to try to install old trusty xp on it... $200 later, guess what?  You CANT INSTALL an earlier operating system!  Booting from the CD doesn't work either, you get the blue screen of death.  Maybe some tech geek can do it, but I'm done wasting time with this thing. ---  --- 4. All that agony, for what?  The "fancy" interface?  Who cares what it looks like, I just want to use my damn scanner!  I'm sure all those slick effects suck up RAM and resources, for what functional purpose?  Just to look more like mac? ---  --- 5. ... Speaking of which, I am now switching to.  Goodbye windows, after 15 years of struggling with your crappy software, I'm done	neg

Hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it.  Easily assembled, up within 60 seconds. I have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway, presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground. There was no rope or stakes with the purchase, I am unaware if these should have been included. Two entrances into the hideaway, the front inverted T entrance is great. However, the rear is a porthole type entrance, not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom. Material not that durable, but with care there should be no issues. a lot bigger than it looks on the site, which was a nice surprise.	neg
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. ---       welcome to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch of people get to the park,the robots begin to have breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest. ---   the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad. a very fun movie	pos
This album sparked the so-called "Neo-Soul" movement years before it was adopted by other artists. Back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and Prince broke the music back down to its roots. This concept was later used by Tone Tony Toni, Brand New Heavies, and D'Angelo.	pos

Learn Catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about 5 years of Spanish and found the CD to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope.   There are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist.   I definitely have benefitted from this CD because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it.  Overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge	pos

I have two of these because they're SO cheap and use them mainly at home if I have a musical idea.  One of the reviewers above mentioned it was a bit muddy which I totally agree with.  But it's incredibly cheap and fairly detailed for that amount of money.  I'm curious how it will hold up over years of use.  Anyway, this is probably the perfect "step-up" mic for podcasts if you are currently recording with your computer's built-in mic or a radio shack dynamic mic.  I would choose this over the m-audio mics- it feels slightly more durable	pos

Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, "A Clockwork Orange" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them. ---  --- Everything changes, however, when one particular break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years, he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program, designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this "treatment" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book: Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you have no freedom of choice? ---  --- The book can be a little difficult to get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence taken from the opening chapter: "He looked a malenky bit poogly when he viddied the four of us like that" (pg. 5). There is no glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters. However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice, comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for "English to Nadsat" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word can be a little difficult. ---  --- One final note of interest: The original British publication of "A Clockwork Orange" had 21 chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the book was first published in the United States, the last chapter was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book. Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change. On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us in his introduction, interpretation is up to you	pos
This little trike is wonderful!!!  My 2 1/2 year old loves it, as does our 5 year old neighbor.

I looked for a trike for many hours/days, and am so happy with this choice	pos
I purchased this particular clock because it was described as an "Outdoor" clock.  Upon receipt of the clock I read the instruction book and under the section entitled "Frequently Asked Questions" is the following:  --- "Q. Can a La Cross Technology clock be used outdoors?   ---  A. Yes, but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 F andd 131 F.  This clock is NOT water-resistant."   --- Living in New England, we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 F.  The clock has a VERY misleading description	neg
After having trouble with a different atomic clock, I decided to try again.  I chose the LaCrosse Atomic clock after reading other reviews from customers and searching online.  Overall, it's been great.  I was able to quickly set it up in my office; the instructions are simple and easy to follow.  My office is in a NYC commercial building, mostly made of mortar and brick with a steel frame.  Initially, I did not receive the signal in the day.  But the instructions pointed out that the signal is strongest at night, and the clock would most likely set at night.  Sure enough, the next morning, it was correctly set (even with the earlier daylight savings time).  I've found the black background with white numbers particularly easy to read from a distance.  My only concern was the same as that of other customers: Amazon packed it poorly, and the inner box holding the clock was totally free to bounce around in the outer box.  Fortunately, the outer box protected it enough, and the clock arrived unscathed.  Overall, I consider myself lucky, given the condition of many boxes delivered to my office building.  Otherwise, this is a nice, accurate, easy to read clock with a sense of style, as well	pos
I just finished the World's Largest Crossword Puzzle last night.  It's been one heck of a project--approximately equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles.  I'm going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall--it really is something to behold when it's all done.  But it's also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance. ---  --- The puzzle itself is moderately difficult, but made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision (it's been re-done once) or perhaps during the original construction some errors were made.  Because of this, many of the clues don't match the answers. Add to that the fact that the author uses many hundreds, possibly even thousands, of abbreviations that are specific to a certain field (e.g. "Abbreviation used in electrical engineering") that no lay person ever has a chance of knowing, and you've got what can be an exercise in frustration.  You can work for hours on one small section and only later find out that the clue doesn't fit the answer. I'm generally pretty dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect, but that's not possible here.  So I had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups and downs.  Still, it's about 98+ percent solvable, which is pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how hard it must have been to create. ---  --- Overall, I enjoyed the process and am pleased with the result.  If you've got the time and energy, I highly recommend this. --- 	neg

Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.	pos
I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item.  "What the heck," I thought.  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning.  This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day.  I like the stuff.  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy.  In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone!  I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt.  In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price.  Hence, two stars	neg

I've had my first bottle of this after shave for a year and I have just finally begun to run out. While I don't use it everday, I use it regularly and when needed. ---  --- I use an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly irritated. This Nivea after shave is wonderful. It only takes a small amount to cover my whole face and neck. It leaves me refreshed and smooth feeling. Sometimes I'll leave the house and forget to put it on, and I'll go all the way back just to put it on. It gets your day off to a great start. No funky smells or textures here. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed	pos

Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested. --- Of course, aside from the beautiful underwater photography, there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world. Jessica Alba looks incredible. Ashley Scott is also gorgeous. And for the ladies, there's Paul Walker and Tyson Beckford. --- I wasn't expecting much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it is entertaining and fun	pos

As others have said, this is a neat concept, but in reality, it doesn't work that great.  After drawing on it, you wet a sponge to erase it.  Think about a small child wetting a sponge.  It ends up a dripping mess!  Then they end up with runny marker all over their hands, which ends up on their clothes, etc.  We're good about watching the kids, too.  You really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it.  The other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days.  Just a very disappointing gift.

Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality.

I realize this is not a true gunshot mic though I had hope. The product presents itself as cheap and I hate to say the results are not good quality.  At this time, I'm the only reviewing customer and I can see I must have been the only guy to buy one of these.   ---  --- Product attaches well and there is a noticable change in the audio.  Three settings, zoom (syncs with camcorder's zoom), gun (which maxs the zoom of the mic regardless of video zoom), and off.   ---  --- I purchased this to make recordings of presentations better.

This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.

Works well. --- It operates a bit slowly but I assume that they all do.  This is not a problem and would not prevent me from purchasing it again. --- A significant advantage of this unit is that the fluid can be evacuated from the unit w/o having to "pour" it out.

I've owned the p-73 for about two years now.  One thing I'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews, is that after a year or so, the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely.  For me, this hasn't happened with this camera.  It's always been great, and it has a lot of really convenient features. ---  --- When I bought this camera, I knew NOTHING about cameras.  I just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was PRETTY.  I got really lucky--I mean, I only bought it because it was pretty--I knew nothing about it.  But, nonetheless, I got lucky and bought this camera that takes AA batteries, came with a battery charger and its own USB cord.  It had a ton of settings on it.  Now that I understand more about photography, I really like the manual setting--the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10-15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class. ---  --- Like I said, i never had any problems with it.  Batteries always lasted long; took little time to recharge.  I never even bought a memory card for this camera--I use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that's all the given memory card can hold, and my pictures are still decent quality. ---  --- I'm now looking into a new camera because I do want excellent image quality, and, ironically, ever since I've been shopping for a new digital camera, my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take; weird. ---  --- Anyway, if you're looking to buy a sony digital camera, based on my experience with this one, I'd recommend the brand	pos

I just had my two and a half year old son evaluated as having SI.  The therapist recommended this book.  I found other reviews interesting and was immediately put off by the cover I am looking for whatever positive help I can get.  I wish more was known about this condition.  Or that I knew of a support group as I don't have any family who live anywhere close around me.  My son has an amazing memory and is very lively and outgoing.  He also has extreme tantrums and throws things and seemed to get really fustrated so some of the SI checklist definetly applyed and made sense.  He also is very keyed into me and I can't even get in the shower or go to the bathroom without him getting upset.  Some of what they state didn't seem to fit him though like he crawled and walked early and seemed to have good co-ordination eating with a spoon or fork?   ---   My husband and I definetly need to understand how to try and change or help things in the home situation. ---   I think it was a bad marketing move to create the cover they did as it creates such a negative reaction	neg
I decided that I had to write a review about Newsweek this morning, after I came across yet another biased, over-hyped cover story. This particular one is entitled, "Rethinking the Marriage Crunch," and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. This was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around, and neglected to have any on this occasion. I really think another reviewer's comparison to People is quite apt, but Newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. Two years ago, we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning "Infidelity Chic." Yes, it seems, according to their sources, spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue, without even a hint of contradiction, that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. I find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. Overall, there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool.	neg
Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont because Main Street is already there.  It is cheaper than building a set.  Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic, mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director, William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight.  Small town smart girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes in the script and then they fall in love.

Overall, this is an extremely awesome concert. I am a big fan of DT, and like pretty much all their stuff. The performance itself is pretty good, although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and Jordan's keyboard solo. Other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album. If they had done more special things, it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4. Other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance, but  would say they did okay as far as that goes. Sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand, thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him, although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands, and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them. The special features are also pretty good, but i would not buy this concert just for those, backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves. Overall, i did think it was pretty cool, and i would recommend buying it if you like Dream Theater or just their genre of music in general	pos
Maybe I expect too much.  However, even my lowest expectation wasnt met.  Just go ask a dermatologist to help, dont waste your money	neg
I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars	neg
I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over	neg

Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old.  I always thought it was pretty neat, but figured he wouldn't sleep in it, because it seems to glide too slow.  My son wouldn't sleep in anything, but his swing. I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he'll sleep in. So based on reviews I got this product.  At first I was a little disappointed, because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else, except his swing.  I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago.  But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now!  I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be.  I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony.  Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it.  Aside from that it's great.  The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son.  It isn't very loud to me.  But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night.  I would say my money is well spent	pos
This cd has so much going on and going for it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans.  Lee Ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks.  He's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right.  ---  --- "Blue in Green" is one of my favorite jazz compositions by Miles Davis and Ernie Watts on tenor sax more than does it justice.  "Ocean Ave." is as breezy and beachy as I think it's meant to be.   ---  --- My favorite tracks are easily "She Walks this Earth" (Ivan Lins' vocals are bossa nova beautiful), "Blue in Green" and predictably for me "Papa was a Rolling Stone" with powerful, crystal clear, unique trumpet by Chris Botti and soulful, rhythmic vocals by Kenya Hathaway and Grady Harrell. I went looking for that track because I am transfixed by Chris Botti's trumpet and what I found was a remarkable cd in its entirety.  Happy me.  ;	pos
I found a case that's almost exactly like this one, except it's $10 cheaper. ---  --- It's made by Samsonite.  model # TM90BLU (there is also a black case).  but like I said, exact same thing.

I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!	neg
This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't	neg
My friends purchased this watch for me in 1998 as a graduating college/leaving for the Army gift.  I have worn it daily for nine years.  It survived the hardships of an Army lifestyle (I wore it daily then, too) and is still going strong.  I have replaced the battery once and had to have the date bezel removed (the thin silver border) because it popped out after my toddler daughter beat on it on the ground various times (yes, I should have moved it to a higher location).  The lens has minor scratches, but nothing that deters from its simple function and aesthetic charm.  This watch has never failed me.  It is simply the best, most durable, watch that I have ever owned	pos

Philosophy products are very eye catching.  Their smart, clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each.  I work with skin care products and don't always believe what they claim.  There are usually far too many claims to be made that simply can't be done to someones skin.   --- This product however, is pretty good.  It's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product, but it does do the job it promises.  The only problem I have with it, is that for someone with sensitive skin, there is far too much frangrant extracts in here.  It cannot be good for sensitive skin.  I'd recommend this to Dry skin people only	pos
Overall, this watch is good:  ---   large numbers ---   fairly standard set of basic features (date, alarm, stop watch) ---   crown seems fairly resistant to scratching ---   Indiglo lighting is great ---  --- Contrary to the description, however, the chronograph does NOT have a lap capability; it only has a split function (2 way). ---  --- As a reminder, it does not have a countdown timer, which seems to be a common theme for many Timex watches	pos
This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell. --- You need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading. I've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work. Unfortunately, there's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading. If there's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath. Still, for the price it's pretty darned impressive. --- You'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions aren't very accurate	pos

I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because... ---  --- Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat. ---  --- Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad? ---  --- Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right. ---  --- (The two stars, if you must know, are for the art.	neg

This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available. But today with  doom and half life versions for xbox, there is actually something to compare halo to, and it doesn't stand up.  ---  --- First off, the plot is utterly pointless. I never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief, just frustrated when he died that I would have to replay a section. ---  --- The weapons are lame. Released after the PC version of quake iii, halo's weapons seem limp in comparison. None of the "futuristic" aspects seem particularly believeable or useful, for that matter. ---  --- The vehicles suck. Driving the vehicles in Halo is as fun as operating a forklift, which is actually quite entertaining in GTA san andreas, so maybe it is not quite that fun. I guess it is more like driving that "super action wacky bike" from the southpark "chimpocoman " episode. ---  --- 2 player story mode rules! the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend. ---  --- multiplayer deathmatch is average. Give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox, but it wasn't as good as it's PC competition when it came out- The much older quake III still looked and played better- and now seems OK but no better than most. ---  ---  --- That said the 2 player campaign and multiplayer make this a good 10-15$ diversion, just don't expect the immersive atmosphere of doom III or the intriguing plot twists of half life,  ---  --- 	pos

This so called game has a very good story and plot. It keeps your attention, by making you want to see what happens next. However, the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old. Why you ask? Because there is none. You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do. There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need. Oooooh. there are multple endings. Whoopee! You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing. Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time, I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. This makes for a good movie but don't buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them	neg

Prismacolor pencils are well-known for their range in rich colors and vibrant laydown, setting them apart from any other type of colored pencil. ---  --- I've tried them myself and I agree. The lead is wonderfully soft, and therefore makes blending colors and pushing them into one another an ease to do.  ---  --- The downside is that the lead is a little too soft, and makes it harder to get the colors smooth (it's easier to do with Crayola because Crayola has harder lead). It can be done, however, and these are great pencils that especially go well with Prismacolor markers. :	pos
I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter. ---  --- The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem. ---  --- If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO	neg

I purchased the MD781 + MD71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the MD681.  I really like the MD681 but I could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock).  Overall I'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use I am already looking for another phone.   ---  --- Handheld phones:  I like them more than any other phone I've tried.  Unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation.  The buttons are a nice size and easy to use. The hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. With one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good, but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation. ---  --- The shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. It's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose. ---  --- As for the Answer Machine:  Once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of  how many messages, if any, are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design), so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages.   The quality of voice messages is a bit grainy. ---  --- I also like how the handset docked in the older M681;  it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the MD781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk. --- 	neg
Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents.  ---  --- I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic	pos

The only problem is its durability (you may find yourself buying 2 per year) but at the price below $10 this is not a real issue. Good luck	neg
Ok, I was hasty in this purchase.  At first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included.  Then I got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera I ordered.  You see, the dimensions listed under "more details" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions).  Turns out, not only do you have to click "more details," (fine print) you also have to click "more technical details." (finer print)  Wish I had now.  Just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case.  ElectroGalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee.  So, at most, after I pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) I might get back $2.  So, yeah I was hasty, but I was also robbed	neg
Thankfully, Moleskine has returned to the 2004 and earlier format in the weekly pages. The vertical columns, apparently a short-lived experiment for 2005, are gone, and replaced by the signifcantly better horizontal spaces for each day. ---  --- Moleskine makes great products. The planner is well-constructed and will survive a year of heavy use with ease. The small size makes it ideal for a purse or briefcase.  The hardcover adds protection and the pockets add functionality. The are perfect for slipping in a phone number or business card to keep handy.

For sheer excitement, you cannot beat this DVD.  The music is exciting, arranged well for brass ensemble, and recorded with high quality.

This camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to PC via USB.

Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product.  However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita.  These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor.  Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired.  If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it.  If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it.  My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia	neg
For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean "bread") both are revolting. ---  --- I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of "Joanna" or "mtspace" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast. ---  --- Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced. ---  --- I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing	pos

Love the price and timer feature...  --- But it seems that once I've used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger. --- If there is a simple fix for this then I'd say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I've been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour	neg

I am very disappointed in this program.  I have been doing my own graphics/cards for about 10 years.  I started with Print Shop (early edition) and progressed thru all the updates.  I then switched to PrintMaster and LOVED it!!!  Again, I have progressed to each new verion with very little or no problems...until now!  This has got to be the worst of the worst--- the program did not want to load without being babied.  When it finally loaded, it was very confusing and I found that I needed to get my graphics from the internet!  The area I live in only allows me to have dial up---you can imagine how long it takes to get the graphics I want!  If you are interested in doing your own graphics/cards, skip this program...go back to PrintMaster Platinum 16 for much better results.  As far as I am concerened, the River Deep Company needs to hide this edition in the DEEPEST RIVER they can find	neg
Regardless of the quality of the magazine, it is really annoying to see Oprah on every single cover! and to make it worst, she does not pick "regular Oprah shots", instead you look at every issue's front cover and ask yourself "How did they take that picture? She doesn't even look like her!" It's as if Oprah is telling all of us "See how I can look like?" Every month is just a new testimony from Oprah, that money does do wonders. ---  --- On the top of that, Oprah's personal thoughts, things, favorites, ideas, even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement. ---  --- I still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article, but the bottom line is the question: Is this a magazine or a show off ?	neg
The Scarf arrived with several holes in it. My daughter was very dissappointed, crying and wondering why Santa sent this to her. We ordered well in advance before Christmas but the set arrived too late. We were never notified that there would be a delay in shipping. A few days before Christmas it arrived! It was too late to do anything. Amazon should improve the quality control of vendors before it allows them to list on their site.	neg

When my boyfriend bought this for me I was so happy and I remember I would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark, starry nights and I would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights, but by the music she sang and how she deeply, richly portrayed those songs. She really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. I totally recommend this CD to start if you have not heard much of her music...SHe truly is addicting once you hear these songs...These songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey	pos

We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so.  We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!.  I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something.  But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight.  It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco.  It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not.  I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning.  Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable.  Definitely worth every dime, we love it.  I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...	pos
This truly is a masterpiece of pop music. There is not a wasted moment. The songs all blend together majestically one after the other. You really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect.  ---  --- I agree with the reviewer that stated that 'Don't Look Back' is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I told a colleague that my heart melts when it plays.  ---  --- I don't mean to be gushing but this album stands apart. I had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat addictive.	pos

I had similar difficulties with this hi-def adapter. For one thing, the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets. And once I did get them on, all I got was a black screen. But thanks to a friend, I figured out what the problem was: ---  --- If you're having trouble getting those Monster cables attached (and who hasn't?), you should get a DeoxIT ProGold Kit by Caig. It's just two very small cans of stuff that help clean off your connectors and, more importantly, act as a temporary lubricant. I got my kit at Radio Shack. I think it was about twelve bucks. ---  --- As for not getting any picture at all, that was my fault. I didn't realize that two of the sets of inputs on my TV are for 1080i only. Once I moved the plugs to the proper jacks, and turned off the signals that did not apply in my Xbox dashboard, the picture was sharp and bright. ---  --- The cables are good quality. My only problem with them is that proprietary digital audio connector. It's kind of lame of Monster to require you to buy their special optical cable that comes with the right adapter. Other than that, if you've got the cash, get these cables, and that Caig kit	pos
A really nice looking t-shirt that was made to show an archeological dig --- revealing an unearthed artifact (a Gibson Les Paul Guitar).

This is a fantastic product and lasts forever, so the relatively steep cost is not so bad.  This is a great product for using under eye makeup, because it makes the eye makeup slip on better and stay on longer, or alone, for a natural but still 'put-together' look.  I love this product more than mascara, and haven't found anything like it in other product lines.	pos

Anthony Hopkins is absolutely riveting as Adolf Hitler.  He captures all of Hitler's mannerisms, quirks, and facial expressions.  My only complaint is that he doesn't use a German accent.  The production is poor, and there are some flaws in the story.  For example, Albert Speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film.  It has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by Speer.  The guy who plays Joseph Goebbels is horrible, one of the worst acting jobs I've seen.  But overall the acting is great, and the performance by Hopkins makes this movie worth owning	pos
This toy was a huge disappointment for me. My boys took one look at it and threw it. I thought it was much bigger than what it is.

I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work.  The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features.

This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page. 	pos
I drink Lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant. When I saw this on Amazon, I assumed it would be great -- but it isn't. Even though this is sold as "drip grind coffee", the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker. The result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup. And decent is as good as it gets -- not great, not even very good -- just decent.  ---  --- Illy's (admittedly much more expensive) drip grind delivers a much nicer, smoother cup using 1/2 as much coffee -- so mabye it's not all that much more expensive in the long run. 	neg
My daughter received this as a gift from Mommy when she was about 3 1/2 months. At first, she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face, but if you take off a ring take it higher, your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy.  The only complaint I have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child.  The mirror distorts your child's vision, so I took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it! My daughter loves it, she could be eating her breakfast, or sitting in her swing and all she'll do is stare at her playmat! A definite must for all parents	pos

I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good. the only thing i don´t like is the way the strings work. there are not enough and also they rip off easily. not stitched well for the price.  ---    ---  Generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed, also suffication could be a problem.  ---  We have bought a convertable crib (common in Europe) which can be used till approx. age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later.  ---  anyhow we still love it. it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari.  --- 	pos

I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen	neg
For the price it's a nice dress.  Check your size carefully.  I'm normally a 29 waist in jeans, usually size 6, sometimes an 8.

If you want a review of the plot itself, complete with spoilers, feel free to read the other reviews.  ---  --- My biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed, again and again, due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn't keep the story straight.  ---  --- There is a homage to Asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm. That would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film. There are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible. ---  --- That said, it was a bit enjoyable. The cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given. If the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked, maybe I would have cared what happened to them. ---  --- The dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say, "Oooh, cool". ---  --- Good premise, good effects, good acting, but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film	neg

This product just doesn't cut my nose hair as close as the Panasonic it replaced. If I could remember the model of the Panasonic, I would mention it in this review. I hope I can find the manual for the Panasonic so I can get another one. ---  --- Beware that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic). The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose). I just won't buy their products anymore if they're going to design them for marginal performance	neg
My job requires a KVM switch for QA purposes to test different OS/browser combinations.  In building the lab I decided to go with Belkin after researching various switches.  I'm configuring a lab with a Mac G4, Mac mini, NC6000 laptop and HP DC5100 mini tower.  I'm using the HP supplied keyboard and mouse, and a ViewSonic 19 LCD flatscreen. ---  --- The first KVM worked well for right at 30 days.  At that point the mouse began to act erratic, followed shortly by the switch only working in the #1 slot (laptop).  I ordered a second switch and the same thing happened within 30 days again. ---  --- I'm going to return the switch and try the well rated IOGear MiniView 4 Port USB KVW.	neg

The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new. ---  --- Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films. ---  --- You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel	pos

"A provocative and surprising thriller." (Fangoria)  --- Yeah it is surprising, surprising-ly bad. It's also provocative, it provoked me to write this bad review.  From the beginning I could tell the director, Chris Fisher, was attempting to create a stylistic film.  However, after the third pointless scene of swirling overlapping shots and panning camera work I gave up.  If you're using style, have a reason.  Style without reason is not style.  This film is one thing, if nothing else, a great lesson in how to over use overlapping shots (also known as crossdisolving shots).  Drink too much and spin around for 10 seconds and you'll get the same effect as the camera work/editing of the film.  There's so much overlapping shots in this film, there's probably 2 1/2 hours of footage on the screen in the 85 minutes that the film is.  It's full of tallent, bad tallent.  It's more about naked women, sex, and drugs than the actual story.  I expected a cheap nock-off of The Life of David Gale. I would have enjoyed that 100 times more that this.  This is bad, annoyingly bad.  Some moron wanted to make a film and got all hung up editing.  Annette Davey, the editor, should have her name removed from the film.  Unless, for some unknown reason, she's proud of her work. If I was studio head at Silver Nitrate Entertainment and somone presented me the final cut of this film, I'd have everyone and anyone associated with it fired, immediately without question.  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment made a mistake with the distribution of this film.  If you enjoy good movies and great camera work, STAY AWAY from this film	neg
I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small. ---  --- This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.) ---  --- Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News. ---  --- I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy. ---  --- For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money	pos

It was time to upgrade my 2.0 MP Canon PowerShot S200 which is more than three years old (ancient in a digital world) to a camera which takes higher quality pictures. The newer Canon cameras had a larger screen, but it was basically the same camera. After a month, I am still pleased that I purchased the Nikon CoolPix S6: ---  --- + push button to switch between camera versus play modes (versus a toggle slide which is hard on the nails) --- + easy-to-navigate mode and menu options with flywheel like an iPod --- + no telescopic lens = no annoying zoom sound during focus, on/off, less wear-and-tear on the most vulnerable component	pos

Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin!  I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial.

I bought this stroller to replace my Combi-Ithru, but found that I needed to keep it.  Although this Schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back.  The recline position is a bit to far back for "mall strolling" making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby. Aside from that, the schwinn handles tough terrain like a Mercedes Benz or Cadillac.  Its great! Baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller.  It has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements.  It steers like a dream! Grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime.  No extra effort needed. The big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby.  My daughter is 13 months old, 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into.  The stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable.  The only thing I don't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby, the reason why I kept my Combi I-thru. Aside from that, I recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain! This one can handle it all.  Happy Strolling. 	pos
When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation	neg
It only became clear to me how MS undermines Mac by using its software as weapon when I began using MS office for Mac. I have used Window's based Excel everyday at work for the last 20 years and I cannot figure out how to use the Mac version efficiently. It seems like an ersatz version from 15 years ago. If you want to work on PowerPoint docs at home created on your PC at work you will find the effort not worth it...the docs will never transfer formatting properly. I bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the PC version. Having said that, there is no alternative to MS office; this is the outcome of MS having monopoly power...no support and an inferior product for Mac user	neg

I've been using Cross pens since I returned to my fountain pen roots several years ago but I decided to try this model because of its gorgeous design.  There are aspects of it that I like better.  The cartridges are longer, unlike the smaller Cross ones that run out much quicker and never seem to drain completely.  It was also ready to go as soon as the cartridge was inserted unlike the Cross which seem to be stubborn to get started.  It has a nice feel to it ergonomically and I nice feel to the nib on the paper. 	pos

I recently got into gymnastics so I started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves. I'm 5'6'' and 180lbs and the XL fits me great. It has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and I don't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up. It's cut low enough so that I'm not getting wedgies and I can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked.

The AMD Ahtlon 64 Venice processor is great. Installed into my new Gigabyte MB without a hitch and runs very cool. That will give up some room for future overclocking. Overall I would highly recommend the processor. By applying for their credit card, I received a really low price from Amazon which was very surprising. About $170.00 with free shipping and no tax. Everyone else was $200-$230 for the same processor. It is a great CPU at a good price from Amazon	pos
Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them	pos
Exactly 3 months after I bought this stroller, a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off, making it dangerous and impossible to use.  Luckily I bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund (in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously).   ---  --- When I tested the stroller at the store, I thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn't last long (which is why I bought the warranty), but the idea of having such a great stroller is why I decided to take the chance.  PROS for the stroller:  very light, compact and easy to fold; easy to maneuver; great for tall people like me--don't have to hunch over to reach the handles.  There are some nice little things too, like ventilation for the back, a headrest, a cup-holder, and a reclining position. ---  --- CONS are: only rated for carrying children under 40 lbs in each seat (didn't know this when I purchased it)--I have a 35 lb. 2 y.o. and a newborn, so we don't exceed the limit there, but my 42 lb. 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it.  The canopy doesn't cover kids well from the shade (only the face--and that's a big deal when living in southern AZ--or if it's raining)--and when the seat is reclined (for my newborn) the canopy doesn't even cover her head (I have to clip on a blanket and drape it over).  My 2-y.o. practically is too big for it--her head extends above the top of the seat.  And finally, the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy. ---  --- Overall, this COULD be a GREAT stroller, but it's just not sturdy--obviously not, it broke--but one would expect that with a brand name "Jeep" it would be built better.  We only use it for walks and going out, no off-trail stuff--we used it about 10 times before it broke.  My umbrella stroller I bought 6 years ago is still going strong--why can't they make this just as well-built?   I would love this stroller if it were just built better	neg

One of the reviews I read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should've had them for her Celine Dion concert.  I took the suggestion and they were perfect!  They fit nicely in my evening bag and brought Celine closer to me as I sat in the Second Mezzanine at Caesar's Palace!  Not only that - but the price was right! I couldn't be happier!  Plus, now I have them for our next trip to Rocky Mountain Park to get up close and personal to some wildlife	pos
I'm delighted to see there aren't a string of 1 star reviews from people who don't get A Mighty Wind. If it has a weakness, its that its played so dryly, its almost like non-fiction that just happens to be funny.  Thank god for Fred Willard who adds some vitally important crassness to these "serious" proceedings. ---  --- I share a sentiment expressed by some of the characters.  I've never liked folk music.  But somehow this movie manages to poke fun at those less cynical times, without being too cynical itself. ---  --- My one dissapointment is that we don't get to see Ed Begley Jr. sing How's It Hangin' Grandma? in Swedish.  Talk about a missed opportunity	pos
I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug. ---  --- I received my razor a couple of days ago and now, I wake up eager to take a shower and shave.  Nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn.  My skin is sensitive and I have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor.  It was worth the price, too, because it is the same cost as 4 sets of Fusion replacements.  The replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job.   ---  --- I have read reviews for this razor by people who, apparently, weren't trained to shave.  This razor will not cut against the grain.  Also, the handle is weighted, so you have to allow the razor to do all the work, or you run the real risk of filleting your face.  Be patient.  A great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor.  Let the razor do the work.  I assure you, even if it takes a few days to get the technique down, you will be thrilled with this razor. ---  --- The nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. I learned that most people like it between one and one and a half.  Mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. Until now, I didn't know that such a thing was even possible.  Happy shaving	pos
These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.	neg

Recently having moved to the midwest, I longed for something different such as the wonderful Japanese food that was so readily available on the west coast.  I was so happy to come across Fugetso-Do on Amazon! I placed an order on Monday evening and by Thursday it had arrived! It was still cold, tasted very fresh and just delightful. Very soft..not rubbery as i have sometimes found in other vendors. Completely satisfied my craving. Would definitely order from again!!	pos
I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this "It's a Wonderful Life"? ---  --- I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--"City of Angels" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this "contemporary nonsense." I feel like it worked. ---  --- My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem. ---  --- Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars	neg

I ordered this clock, and then had to send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged (actually, minimally damaged). The first two times the glass was cracked and broken. By the third time, all that was the matter was minor dent marks in the metal frame where the packaging must have pressed down on it (this is only noticeable in certain light angles). The shipping problems weren't the manufacturers fault though, as Amazon did the packing and shipping. It'd be nice if they maybe put a big "Don't stack things on top of this box" sticker or something on the box so that it didn't get damaged. Or, bubble wrap, remember that stuff?! Those airbags just ain't cuttin' it.  --- On the clock itself, I love it. I kept it despite the minor denting b/c it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and it's the largest atomic clock I could find that didn't have some ugly antique-ish design. The second hand actually ticks, instead of fluidly moving, which is a nice touch. It was easy to set up, and it's big and easy to read. It reminds of the clocks all over my high school (in a good way). All in all, very happy with the actual clock, very dissatisfied w/ Amazon's shipping and packing of it	pos
I bought this item for my husband for Christmas.  He has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him.

This is a camcorder for the digital age. Tiny, multi-functional, and flexible. No ancient-technology magnetic tape. As with any product on the leading edge, there are many shortcomings. ---  --- Let's dispense with the obvious. This device is all about compact go-anywhere flexibility and ease. For best image quality, a dedicated mini-DV camcorder and dedicated digital still camera is the only way to go. In fact, buying a separate camcorder and still camera may likely be less expensive than the Sanyo C6 while resulting in superior quality. ---  --- Overall image quality is best described as "OK". The poor lens zoom and aperture is more befitting a $100 digital camera than a $400 device. The flash is weak and will not light many scenes that any other still camera would light. In addition, since the flash is not offset in any way from the lens, red-eye is virtually guaranteed at any range. This is not a problem with digital touch-up being common practice, but plan on touching up more often. Low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically in video mode. Virtually any digital camcorder at any price will outperform this Sanyo in video mode in any situation, but a little day light goes a long way towards improving video quality with the Xacti C6. Also, to be clear, the video quality is still superior to anything seen in the best of analog camcorders. ---  --- For all these negatives, the convenience can be truly revolutionary. One can wear the tiny VPC-C6 around the neck all day. This causes an amazing change in attitude towards video. Since the Sanyo is so compact, no one would think twice about bringing it along on any minor travel. Being freed from the chore of "packing up" a camcorder  means a corresponding willingness to bring the Sanyo on so many more occasions, such as a visit to the park instead of just weddings and birthday parties. And whereas a mini-DV camcorder requires one hour to transfer one hour's worth of video to your computer, the Sanyo transfers video as fast as the SD card and USB 2.0 interface will allow. That means five minutes or less to transfer one hour's worth of video to a computer. This ease increases willingess to create video and share video. No more procrastination over dragging out the camcorder wiring and the manual task of initiating video transfer to a computer. With the Sanyo, just place the camera in the docking station and pictures and video files are available just like files on a USB flash drive. It is difficult to overestate the significance of this convenience. Video becomes an everyday pleasure, if one so wishes, rather than a special occasion chore. If one values this convenience over absolute image quality, this is the product to own. ---  --- This is a leading edge product. To get the most of this product, I highly recommend doing the following: --- 1) Sanyo has provided an updated firmware on their website. This fixes a fatal flaw in the audio processing that some people have noted as excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive with other camcorders. In addition, this firmware update adds compatability with 4gb SD cards (the limit is 2gb without the update). Kudos to Sanyo for the continuing support. (Note that the instructions are a littled distorted in the translation - what they meant to write is that you need to push the SET button to the LEFT to enter the firmware update screen.) --- 2) The video is in MP4 format and is playable only with Quicktime. For Windows users, this limits video editing to the included programs or Quicktime-specific programs. There is an easy solution. First, download the Divx codec (a freeware commercial product) or Xvid codec (a free open source product - my preference) or ffdshow (a free open source product) - use your search engine of choice to find these. Second, download a utility called "MP4CAM2AVI" (a free open source software found easily with your search engine of choice). With these two programs, the video becomes compatable with any Windows program, including just about any media player (such as Windows Media Player) and any video editing tool (such as Windows Movie Maker). ---  --- I look forward to seeing how this market segment evolves. The freedom from bulk and digital tedium is addicting and I am sure the image quality will continue to improve. For now, I am happy capturing the memories that would have otherwise been lost had I continued to own a conventional bulky tape-based camcorder	pos
Lieven's article, "In the Mirror of Europe: The Perils of American Nationalism";is succinct, cogent, and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. My experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance, whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11, war on terrorism and god, which the majority of my students now accept as truth. I have one suggestion, I think Mr. Lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. I feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch, much of the leadership of coporate America, an increasing number of Jewish and Christian denominations, much of the media-particularly AM talk radio, higher education, the military, and with another four years of the current administration, federal courts at all levels. I will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. I think the article was well-written and important, my congratulations to the author	pos

Let's start with the negatives. This vid is too damn short. A half-an hour doesn't do justice to the title Groovy Gals. Where are the Marvellettes? Where is Brenda Holloway? Second, because the acts are taken from different  shows, Groovy Gals has no flow and a chopped quality that is only made  worse by shoddy editing. Third, host Jimmy O'Neill is really irritating and  useless on these tapes. Why not edit him out and give us more acts? On the  positive side, this tape has more rock royalty than you could shake a gold  record at! The Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, just nails The Shoop Shoop  Song with her gospel-spiced vocals, and mention must be made of The  Blossoms, led by the legendary and highly-underated Darlene Love. They back  up Franklin and a number of acts and look like they're really having fun  with I Like It Like That. Speaking of rock royalty, my personal faves, The  Supremes, glide through Baby Love with the style and sophistication that  made them Princesses of Pop. Ross has big hair and, with Flo and Mary, does  the slick, subtle choreography that tattooed them as Motown acts. A rare  treat is Ketty Lester torching out Love Letters. Wow! Watch her make the  word "sign" an eight-syllable word in song, and enounciate each  word. But the wildest was the last: The Acid Queen, Tina Turner,  electrifies with Ooh-Poo-Pah-Do. Tina in a tasteful cocktail dress and nice  pumps is jarring enough, but when she lets out the clutch and revs the song  up (Backed by The Blossoms who are clearly enjoying themselves) you will be  hard pressed to tear your eyes away. Other acts include The Toys looking  bored and jaded as they sit in a fake garden setting in Lover's Concerto;  Leslie Gore romping through Judy's Turn To Cry with Shindig's lame go-go  dancers; Fontella Bass with her one hit, Rescue Me; Great rare Shangri-La's  footage of Give Him A Great Big Kiss (such naughty shimmies!); Jackie  DeShannon's tender version of Burt Bacharach's What The World Needs Now and  Petula Clark showing too much Brit restraint with her monster hit Downtown.  Yes, the filming is b+w and strange at times, but if you love the time  period or the music this one is a necessary document for collectors and  fans. Enjoy	pos
After I had my 2nd son, we bought a Graco double stoller, but it was SO long, heavy and cumbersome that I only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it.  We bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and I love it!  Great stoller, lightweight, easy to manuvuer and my 4 year old loves to ride in it b/c he can either sit or stand in the back.  It's much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too.  I wish that I had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment.  I highly recommend this stoller, but do wish that the parent tray/cup holder came standard with the stoller	pos
I was looking for a beginner microscope for my 7 year old.  This was probably more than she needed for her age, but with adult supervision, it should last well into her later elementary years.  The package came secure and on time.  It was exactly what I expected.  It is a solid product and I prefer the plug in option that this product offers versus other products that require batteries.  The highest power (400x) is difficult view with some slides but I believe it has to do with practice.  We have been successful viewing certain slides with the highest power setting with some patience.  It is absolutely fascinating.	pos

What a great line of sauces the Scarpetta brand brings to the table.  I have tried all of them and the time saving of having these already in my kitchen is very helpful.

The flavor profile of each of the Scarpetta brands is unique and tastes truly homemade.  You can feel the love that went onto each sauce.  Try them, you won't regret it	pos
I've seen better high end audio books. I'm certainly not a member of the aforementioned "Scientific School of Audio System Performance Analysis", the only instruments that can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side of your head. I listen to what my ears tell me sounds good, and generally, tubes sound good. Which is why this book is sort of a disappointment, you'd think that out of 80 projects there'd be at least one tube phono preamp, but unfortunately there are no tube amps, just a few rants about how tubes don't produce enough power. Who uses more than a watt anyway? Even the transistor amps presented aren't much better than what you could get from Rex or Circuit City, similar schematics could probably be found on the internet for free. Go ahead and buy it if that's the sort of thing you're into, but if its tubes you want, try Morgan Jones' "Building Valve Amplifiers", it doesn't have many schematics but it covers  in great detail the layout and contruction of tube amps. Good schematics can be found on the intarnub	neg
I am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch, I purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix:  cilantro, basil, parsely, thyme, savory, sage and oregano.  The parsely and sage are from the new French Herbs kit.  ---  --- Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The sage grows very quickly and is more robust than even the basil.  The parsely seems to be slow but steady.   ---  --- Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal. ---  --- I recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past	pos

This was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the Marian cult. The one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-Christian origins of the Marian cult. Other resources, however, cover  the evolution of the Anatolian fertility cult of Cybele into the Roman  Magna Mater and later into the so-called "BVM". The author does a  good job of showing the origins of various aspects of Mariology and  contrasting these developments with Christianity in the West. The author  has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the  syncretic process which blended Christianity with various pagan religions  and medeival political structures to create the Roman Catholic Church	pos

I'm not the most gadget inclined person, and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use.  But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two.  In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the "3:00" position on the dial.  And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation.  It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time!  Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless.  I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead.  Even if it costs more.  Why spend money on something that doesn't work	neg
Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.

It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier.  I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the "awful" German language was hilarious.  In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing.  The scene "riding" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face.  It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or "typical" American's attitudes today. ---  --- I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe.  It's way funnier than his "Innocents Abroad", which is also a good read on travel in Europe	pos
My 2 year old daughter (and our 4 & 6 year old neighbors) LOVE this toy!  I had it up during my daughter's second birthday party and all the kids loved it!  It holds up very well and I have only had to refill it once (and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug).  Some of the balls are not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this.  It is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes.  I would recommend this for any kids around 4 or under.  The one thing to keep in mind; the kids may be afraid of it at first; my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there	pos

The Economist has to be the best weekly magazine for current events.  Whether you are conservative or liberal you will appreciate the well thought out and reasoned essays that this magazine has to offer.  I don't think this will end up swaying people's political opinions too much but it will at least provide an informed opinion.  Americans know too little about the world around them and this is the perfect tool for fixing that. ---  --- There are arguments that this magazine swings on both sides of the political fence depending on your views.  I have my opinions on this but still love it.  The articles I disagree with force me to think and hone my own debates.  To compare this magazine with Newsweek or Time is like comparing a precision automobile with one of those 25 cent rides kids enjoy.  Sure they make the motions of a car, and look like a car but in the end they don't go anywhere and you wasted your money with nothing to show for it.  This magazine does more with its short essays than Newsweek could ever do with its six-page layouts. ---  --- Too bad there isn't a "teen" version of this magazine.  That would do a lot to rectify America's education problems. ---  --- I find the argument that some people cite that this magazine has a severe pro-laissez faire bias is ridiculous at best.  It is like criticizing Auto magazines for having a combustion engine bias.  This is a magazine of economics.  Since laissez faire economics is the basis for just about every single economy in the world, they concentrate on it.  Sorry but Marxist and Keynesian economic models didn't pan out.  Maybe if feudilism mounts a come back they might change their focus, until then we are stuck with reality.	pos
I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter.  I was so surprised at the quality for Little tykes.  It has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed.

This sparkling juice really holds up to the description.  It has the perfect amount of carbonation (not too much, not too little), is crisp to the taste, and is very refreshing.  The 8 oz. cans sounded pretty weak, but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting. ---  --- Since first tasting Martinelli's sparkling apple cider at a New Year's celebration over a decade ago, I've been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks, but none have been "just right."  Naturally, I've tasted the types that I've come across over the years, including: Martinelli's sparking cider (which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption), Martinelli's sparkling apple juice (a bit under-carbonated), Apple Beer (non-alcoholic, good but has a slightly odd taste), Appletiser (UK only, good, but UK only), and a few other local organic brands. ---  --- All of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion, but seriously... none compare to essn's Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice.  Yeah, it is a little pricey, but its worth it	pos

This is one of the BEST weightlifting gloves that I have found so far!!  I like it so much, that I've bought a few pairs.  These have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting - to help prevent injury.  The rest of the glove is terrific.  It is thicker around the palm and fingers, so it provides EXCELLENT cushioning for those heavy lifts. I have not had  one blister, or redness since I've started using these gloves, and I've been using them for over a year now.  They are extremely comfortable. After a year of use, my gloves are still in perfect condition too.  I've tried other brands, and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers,  and this causes redness and blisters, so what's the use of using them?  On the other hand, this Valeo Ocelot Wrist Wrap Weightlifting glove is perfect in every way!!  Has support, comfort, and it looks great. I have the orange pair (GLOW), and I get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look. Well worth every penny.  Way to go Valeo!	pos
I ordered the ants in December (Christmas present), and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout January, no ants arrived. I have called several times, with the same excuse.

This is a very nice watch.  It is smaller than it looks in the picture, but I actually like it better that way--it is delicate and lady-like.  The pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished.  It makes a nice dressy or everyday watch.  I have seen similar Seikos in the stores for much more money. 	pos
I did a lot of looking before purchassing a Krusell, and opted to pay a little bit more for a product that appeared to be top notch.  It was a great investment.  The Krusell case holds the Blackberry securely and yet maintains easy use.  Cosemetically, it looks great with professional attire or with casual clothing!  The pockets inside work great for holding credit cards or business cards!  This is an excellent product	pos
This ring had such great ratings, after visiting it often, I finally bought it as a gift. When I saw it in person, I was not impressed. It does look like the picture, but it also looks cheap. I do realize it costs cheap, I just wasn't impressed. It did arrive VERY quickly though	neg

College stoner cult following aside, Hunter S. Thompson's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last February.  Thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material, counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment.   ---  --- On the Campaign Trail should be required reading for all those who hold a less skeptical view of American politics than say, the average WWE heavyweight title match, for a truly sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when The Undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the referee turns his back.  Hunter has long since traveled through this looking glass -- although he can at times be found expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s -- but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious.  The image of Thompson infiltrating the Nixon Youth at the RNC and yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist John Chancellor's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids chanting "Four more years!" was one of the funniest any book has offered me in a while. ---  --- How does the cliche go -- "The more things change, the more they stay the same"?  After the thorough spanking of George McGovern at the hands of Richard Nixon, HST credits the most staggering blow to McGovern's presidential hopes to a media crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee, Thomas Eagleton.  Just days after Eagleton was named as McGovern's running mate, two Democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing that Eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions.  As the story spread like wildfire throughout the press, McGovern's presidential hopes were dealt a blow from which they would never recover.  Since then, we've seen Willie Horton and the Swift Boat Veterans come out to haunt their respective candidates, and one is inclined to wonder who the Democratic "mascot" will be for the 2008 race.  Perhaps a mentally disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of Hillary Clinton?  A Dominican prostitute who gave Joe Biden the clap? ---  --- But I digress.  I give On the Campaign Trail 4 out of 5 stars because the book, like presidential campaigns themselves, can at times seem uneventful.  Thompson addresses this from time to time, wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix.  Other parts of the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of politics.  For instance, HST's extensive interview with campaign manager Rick Stearns, where Stearns explains the intricacies of acquiring state delegates, reads like hieroglyphics to me.	pos

I purchased this car for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  Shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to Christmas morning.  The car lights up and makes sounds (very annoying) but didn't move an inch.  I replaced all batteries - still no movement.  The manufacturer was of no help.  Thank god someone else also got him the Chicco remote control car - because it works! ---  --- Steer clear of this stinker	neg
I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful.  ---   ---  I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with.  ---   ---  First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera).  ---   ---  I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch.  ---   ---  Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above.  ---   ---  I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results.  ---   ---  The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this.  ---   ---  Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations.  ---   ---  For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable.  ---   ---  In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue	pos

I registered for this sling, and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift. I couldn't wait to use it. When my son was about 3 weeks old, I tried to put him in it. We both instantly hated it. Its far too bulky to use with an infant, and it doesn't adjust small enough to fit my frame (I'm 5'6" and FAR from skinny). I kept it, thinking that my son would eventually fit in it, and perhaps as he got bigger I'd be able to wear it. WRONG. I wish I'd brought it back when I could still return it. My son is now 11 months old and we still can't use this sling. There's no way he can sit in it securely. He hates being held but can't walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this, but it still doesn't fit me, and my 24 pound son isn't held safely in it. He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds. I'm expecting again, and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby	neg

It holds my bike but seems unstable - I still can't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car, and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards.

Product matches expectations; no problems. Some other customers complained about how lightweight it is. To me it seems like what you should expect from titanium (after all, that's why they use it to make aircraft). The predictions of it getting sprung (losing its spring tension) were more of a legitimate concern to me, but I've had it for a month or two and it seems fine. It seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip, which is to say, maybe it eventually will, or maybe it won't, them's the risks of life. Go for it	pos
Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from "Sports" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled  nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them  with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). On bad days when she can't eat solid food, I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb-El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake. --- 	pos

We just got a PS2 after having no game system at all since the old Atari I had when I was 13.   So learning all the "new fangled" controls is a bit tricky.

This blatently derivative (hat tip to Ridley Scott's Alien, with a hint of Stanley Donen's Saturn 3 thrown in) movie should surely win the award for the most irritatingly gratuitous over-use of strobe lighting ever. This makes it extremely uncomfortable to watch and is, presumably, employed to detract from the lack of any genuine thrills. Throw in a ridiculously precocious ship's computer and a downright silly robot, and this adds up to one helluva big turkey in space. James Spader and Angela Bassett do their best to make something out of an inadequate script and plot, but this is unremittingly dreadful and dull.  The "happy ever after" finale will probably make you cringe in its corniness. Supernova's only redeeming factor is that it is very short	neg
I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV... ---  --- I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.   ---  --- Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down	neg

If one has to be on a restricted diet and finds a company, or in this case a bakery that supplies treats to those who can not eat regular sweets, this wonderful bakery is the answer.

I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona). ---  --- The Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.	pos

First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo, NY where it sold for close to $60/lb.  Love it, even though it was only 2 oz.  Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon.   ---  --- It's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water.  It is non-acidic like some other teas.  It need no addition of cream or sweetner.  I'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light.  It's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color, with the hint of a flora or fruity taste. The added plus at Amazon is the price and very quick shipping.   ---  --- I would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and I'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea	pos

Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, "unacceptable" because it's unsafe.

     This card, using VIA's superb Envy24 HT chipset, is a huge improvement over my Realtek and VIA Envy24HT-S based cards.  Everything sounds better.   ---  ---      My old Audigy 2 platinum (which I think I shall melt) did better in 3D games, but only slightly. Since this card doesn't snap, crackle, and pop like the Creative cards do, I'll venture to say that it actually DOES make games better, since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game. ---  ---      PROS: --- * Very high audio sampling rates, allowing for incredibly good audio production; warm, rich, warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs. --- * No crackling, popping, or hissing!  A real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why Creative Labs cards keep doing this. --- * Well-maintained, solid drivers. --- * Supports EAX 2.0 --- * Excellent ASIO support. ---  ---      CONS: --- * No hardware support for DirectSound; however, if your machine is faster than about 1GHz, you probably won't notice the difference.  Benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you'll find that no hardware DirectSound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1% difference in speed. --- * Only supports up to EAX 2.0, due to Creative Labs refusing to license the technology.  Sound difference is minimal, though	pos

Despite the excellent screenplay by Sam Shepherd and the solid acting by Harry Dean Stanton, I found "Paris, Texas" a rather unimpressive film, and the only thing that kept it together for me was Cooder's astounding soundtrack. The music here is simple, yet very moving and even haunting. His guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film was otherwise supposed to convey. It seems to seep right out of the desolate landscape of the Southwest. Every time I listen to this CD it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in Nevada, SE California, etc. Also, it's really nice that the soundtrack contains the story ("I Knew These People") told by Stanton's character, since to me that was the best part of the movie. Even so, seeing "Paris, Texas" is not a prerequisite for enjoying this CD, the music is phenomenal in its own right	pos

I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts	neg
Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it. ---  --- As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly. --- I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. --- I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste. --- As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money. ---  --- Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that.. ---  --- It is absolutely infuriating	neg
This was a subject of much conversation when I was deployed to Saudi Arabia and it's still a favorite with most military and Civilians in Iraq. "Ground Hog Day" is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here.	pos
I didn't like these at all.  The toes are too pointy and wouldn't fit.  Might be ok for younger children than stated. 	neg
I am very unhappy with this product.  The handle is hard to turn, and it takes too long for the clown to pop up.  When the clown does pop up it smells like a forst fire inside of the toy.  Over all I would not recomend it	neg

Purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren....This is Boring and absolutely NO FUN no matter what your age.  I guess for almost $40 you shouldn't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting. Doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it. --- 	neg
I bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my iPod. I used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound. Sending these ones back. I must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well (Much to my Mom's dismay, she couldn't fuss at me :-P ). Oh well.	neg
Even though Tsui Hark is one of my favorite Hong Kong directors, this movie did not at all show his skill. The story was poor along with the actors performances. I may be a little biased since I love John Woo, and  Tsui Hark killed their friendship by making this movie. Worth checking out  but i would'nt buy it if I were you	neg
I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.	pos
No reviews available pre-purchase.  Set was Totally useless.  Laughably out-of-date. Poor color.  Two disks had flasws at the ends.  I wanted to use them for a Bible study group, but wound up throwing the three dvd set in the trash.  The cost and trouble of returning for credit were not worth the effort.  -- Zero stars but one star was the lowest rating accepted. -- I exopected better of Amazon	neg

This is an overpriced, under designed lounger.  The concept is cool, the product is not.  The idea of being able to read while face down is completely useless if you wear glasses.

I bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste.  The camera was much smaller than expected, trying to figure out what mode you're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret. Nothing is a simple "one step" procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children.  I was so frustrated setting it up that I didn't bother giving it to her.  The software installed okay but was also far from "kid friendly".  I wish I would've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase. Ironically, the reviews I did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids.  I believe you'd be better off purchasing a "regular" inexpensive digital camera for your potential "shutterbugs". 	neg
I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund	neg
I thought that these would be great, but could never get them to work right. Sometimes they would flow sometimes not. I would have to take the bottom off to make it work and then remember to put it back on after using them or dump it all over. To many pieces, to much trouble, I would be upset and my baby would be also! Switched to Avent and loving it	neg
This is the same toy I was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle. The women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store.

For those of you looking for more Eva action after seeing the original series take heed. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The Death part of the DVD, part 1, is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season, and the second half, Rebirth, part 2, is new stuff, very good, BUT! If you buy 'The End of Evangelion' you get Rebirth AND a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material. So, don't buy 'Death&Rebirth'. Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead	neg
This product far exceeded my expectations.  It installed very easily with no bother and has functioned perfectly since the first day.

This Minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a cult-following,  --- and the reason is not far to realize.  Joe Mazzello.  Joe is a  --- 1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon.  His presence --- in this movie is so REALISTIC and life-life that you forget that --- he is acting.  He was pivotal in carrying this movie.  How so? --- May I add that Joe's axiom for acting is simply:  "Just make it look Real!" He achieved this to a stellar degree in "The Cure," and also in the later fare: "Simon Birch".  Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical --- score for it.  No, I am not going to name-drop. ---  --- The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social/geographical/educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly --- forged and may I add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film.   --- Joe is the best! ---  ---  --- 	pos
Lack of balance...if one thing could be pointed at as the problem, it is the lack of balance. ---  --- The battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didn't pan out. As has been mentioned, the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle. Also, the monotony of the enemies left me wanting. During one area of the game, in the Sandsea, I had a chain of 164, I wasn't trying to get chain points, either. No matter how good the battle system was designed, 164 of the same enemy, in a row, gets boring. ---  --- The license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in FFX. I loved the sphere grid, wasn't so fond of this system. Obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success, requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure. At level 20, Penelope had cleared the Magick section of the grid, although, her highest level magick that was of use was Cura...hardly an impressive skill. ---  --- The storyline was like riding a snail. Too many cut-scenes and not enough interesting developments. The gil distribution was down-right ridiculous. Leveling up for hours, exploring every nook-and-cranny of a dungeon, and still not having enough money to improve your weapons...there just wasn't a good balance. There needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting, in past games, leveling up was just as fun as progressing the story...it felt like a necessary chore in FFXII. For nearly every enemy I remember, you got 1 license point per kill. By a rough estimation, 1800 enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing system. ---  --- The last rant was the character classes, or lack of. Any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want (for a necessary price). While the openness can be good, it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost. After all, so what if Vaan gets that new axe when Basche is right behind (note: I mentioned a weapon...there are no special abilities unique to any character, either). ---  --- Between the lack of rewards, gil, ability increases with experience, and monotony of battles, I would not recommend this game. I put 20 hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt (the mini-games are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about, comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous FF games). I believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental. Naturally, another person may like everything I ranted on above. Like any FF game, you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addicted...I lost interest in the middle of the addiction-stage	neg
This Scooby-Doo VHS is ABSOULTY HORRIBLE!!

You can clean any kind of metal with this product.  I think you should buy it.  For the most part it's like copper and silver polish, only it's intended for metal.  Sometimes it may leave a few streaks here and there if you don't wipe the surface of the metal entirely.  If that happens, apply a touch of water and continue rubbing until the streaks go away	pos
Firefly is a fantastic series.  My wife and I watched the DVD set from and found ourselves rationing the episodes towards the end, because we didn't want the series to be over.

I have never enjoyed a season of any show more than I enjoyed Firefly, and everyone I've introduced to it has loved it as well	pos

My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother's 88th b-day (coming up soon) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf.  Every silk scarf she came across she would say, "What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are."  Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon, she had looked online stores at Macy's, Nordstorm, JcPennies, but couldn't really compare with the ones Vietmade made.  I agree with my wife when she said, "This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.  My wife and I definately recommend this place and we'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future.  Also, delivery was on schedule, good packaging and love the scarfs!	pos
We found the program to be easy to install and the lessons easy to retrieve. The lessons are presented in a variety of ways to accomodate one's learning style.  The accompanying text is not difficult to understand and is very helpful in explaining the basics of the program.

So far, we are pleased with the materials and have felt quite successful in learning some basis phrases.	pos

This magazine seems most interested in promoting books, etc. that it has a financial interest in--most notably lately the South Beach Diet. Prevention and it's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads.  Too bad, because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition, weight loss, exercise and natural remedies that isn't influenced by it's publishing partners and advertisers. Skip this one, and try Self or Health for a more well-rounded look at women's heath needs	neg
Very comfortable.  Better quality than most.  Good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside.  Sizing appears to right on for me.  I take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right.  The laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe.  I doubt they will last very long outside, but who wears slippers to the store??  Highly recommended! 	pos

This set of earrings was only $10 and the delivery from Silver Insanity was fast, but false advertising really pisses me off.

The other earrings that I bought from them also do not look much like their photos	neg
The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that! --- My whole family, kids and all, watched this with me and loved it! --- I can see why Yi Soon Shin is Korea's hero and why other countries teach his methods	pos
Comparisons to the 1937 classic are inevitable. Story-wise, there is little difference except for the colonization of the remake. Many of the frames are carbon copies of each other. This reviewer feels that the b&w format of the original added to the suspense. The original cast is clearly superior especially the male leads of Ronald Coleman, David Niven and C. Aubrey Smith. Also, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. outshines James Mason as Rupert of Hentzau, the main bad guy. (I wonder if a stunt man performed that high dive.) A nice gesture is the cameo role of Lewis Stone,  the star of the 1922 SILENT version. It is the 1952 female leads who compare most favorably: Deborah Kerr comes very close to equaling Madeleine Carroll as the lovely Queen Flavia, with her strong (!) sense of duty. And Jane Greer probably surpasses Mary Astor's 1937 role. Both Mary and Jane are key to the plot. Watch them closely! Blessedly, despite the many frame similarities, the remake does not carbon copy the 1937 fadeout, with Ronald Coleman's gallant wave of farewell. On its' own merits, the 1952 version is a very credible adventure story indeed. It only suffers from comparison to an original classic it cannot possibly surpass	pos

We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish.  That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival.  Of course it had to go in with the sharks.  So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in.  The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom.  After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered.  So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive.  I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish	neg
Korg makes good stuff all the way around, and this tuner is no exception. It's affordable and easy to use.

All in all, this is a great deal and it'll help you keep your instrument in ready-to-play condition	pos

I haven't had any problems using this DVD/CD burner over Firewire on a G4 iMac running Mac OSX Tiger. In fact, setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual; it was truly plug-and-play. ---  --- Minor quibbles: the open/close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended, the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case, and only the Lite version of Toast 6 is included. ---  --- Bottom line: I would buy this burner again, given my experiences using it	pos

This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning. We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it. It's just a fabric cover, perhaps with an extra layer of material, but it CAN'T be foam. Maybe only 1/4" thick at most. Then, after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4" rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally. BAD BED	neg
I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does.	neg
I bought this watch because I wanted something inexpensive, but still professional looking.  I like the lightness of the watch, the thin size, and the simple design.  It does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than I would like, but still not very noticeable.   ---  --- If you haven't seen other comments about getting the watch sized, pay attention.  I took it to a professional jewelry repair shop, and they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches.  I would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while.  The jeweler I went to has a good reputation, but does not sell Skagen.	pos
My daughter (15 months) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll, which was a gift from my best friend.  I've NEVER seen her react like this to any gift. My daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere--usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware. The doll has a soft, squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has, as my husband is constantly saying, "a hard plastic head." 	pos
On a gusty day when I saw the chessy plastic thermometer I gave my wife for Mother's Day shattered on the back deck, I decided it was about time to replace it with something decent. I did my home work on the internet and found that La Crosse made good quality unit at a reasonable price. After opening the box when my WS-8025 arrived and reading over the instructions, I had it up and running in under 20 minutes. The WS-8025 allows you to adjust the barometer to local conditions (which you can get on line from your local schools). ---     I've had it up a running for two weeks and find that the WS8025 does a good job of forecasting the weather. The atomic clock took a day to link up (which they tell you in the manual it might) but has stayed linked up since. ---     I purchased the optional TX3UP with remote probe that I have in my fish pond. So besides seeing the outside temerature and humidity, I can keep an eye on the pond. You can set the WS-8025 to alarm at any high and low temperatures that you chose. (Which came in handy the other night when the pond heater failed). ---      So far I'm happy with my purchase and I like the way the LaCrosse WS-8025OAK looks on the wall.   ---     	pos

Excelente opcion para aquellos que manejan mucho. Permite una buena ventilación en la espalda y el apoyo lumbar es adecuado para largas horas de manejo sin sufrir de fatiga.  --- Se le colocó a un Hyundai Getz 2007 y a un Geo Metro 1994 y a ambos automoviles se acopló perfectamente. --- El unico punto en contra es que no queda muy claro como se debe sujetarse al asiento y no viene con instrucciones.  --- ---- --- Excellent option for all people who drives a lot per day.

after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown	neg
The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good.

I bought this to clean my LCD monitor because fingerprints highly annoy me, but I use it to clean and dust everything around because it does such a great job dry without cleaners or anything and so it takes just a few seconds.  Cleans lenses, monitors, surfaces, etc. with no scratches.  It really holds on to dust and dirt.  Wash it every once in a while, especially if you clean up particularly abrasive dust for some reason.  Shaking it out outside works fairly well for regular dust, too, and lets you know how effective the thing is	pos
Several tunes on 'Back to Oakland' feature Tower of Power at their best.  One in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track, 'Squib Cakes'.   ---  --- Featured soloists include a short, mellow guitar solo from Bruce Conte, followed by Greg Adams' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range (leading one to believe it's a trombone!) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish. ---  --- Tenor madness abounds from lead saxman Lenny Pickett (known primarily for his work as lead Tenor for the Saturday Night Live band), wailing in-tune in the difficult altissimo range (jazz musicians call these 'freak notes' because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ), while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout.  ---  --- Chester Thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky Hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in LA in the early 70s - without the probability of cancer.  Lyrical yet hard-driving, Thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant 'Squib Cakes', then takes off on his own flight, delving out perfect 16th-note runs as though Bach suddenly had learned some jazz Hammond himself.  In the middle of the solo, as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove, Thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand, chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left, that in the days of hearing this on vinyl, I wondered if my record was skipping through that section!   ---  --- To finish the groove, at the end of Thompson's solo, the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets.  After he closes, we're back to the head to close out the tune.  ---  --- Even with so much to savor, this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more, even after the final stroke of the last chord.  The musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album's other tunes.  I have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time I spin it. I recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore Tower of Power's "sound." ---  --- - Kathryn Shut	pos
A remarkable introduction to Ezra Pound.  Makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the Cantos--periplous, ideogram, fugue, the 'repeat in history'--and gives concise readings of individual sections  that helped my understanding enormously.  He does an especially good job of  connecting Pound's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity.   Makin manages to be critical of Pound while treating his ideas with verve  and sympathy;  the writing is colloquial, witty and jargon-free.  I enjoyed  the Cantos much more after reading this short, effective study	pos

The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania. The sidescrolling platform action is spot on, the graphics truly push the limits of the DS, and the variety of equipment/soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play. ---  --- As people have said in past reviews, the use of the touch screen feels tacked on. To defeat bosses you have to draw symbols on the screen, which can be frustrating if a) you have poor penmenship, or b) are left-handed (such as yours truly) and have to scramble to take the stylus out, switch it to your other hand, and draw the symbol. It's a neat little addition but, again, it didn't really need to be there. ---  --- Also, the boss battles are sometimes a little too easy, even in the later levels. Don't get me wrong, there are some that are just downright nasty, but some of the bosses fire off their special weapon and all you can do is look at the screen and go "... that's it?" ---  --- Overall, this is another great game for the Nintendo DS. With the exception of the clunky touch screen addon, the game is overall fantastic	pos

It can go really fast and it's easy to steer.   You have to be careful if  you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it.  One time my mom was  pulling me and my sister to the store.  When she went over the curb it  tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. It is a great toy  and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot	pos
Very pretty game and fun; but for OLDER children.  This game has way too many cards to be played properly for my [..].  This is going to stay on the shelf until she can play with all the cards	pos
I found the size range to be completely missleading. My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable.  The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be	neg
This game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes.  Also, if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again.  It's a huge waste of money.  For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the DVD or have more than one DVD included in the game.   --- This is a BIG disapointment	neg
Arrived in timely fashion, product was exactly as described, I carry it in my pocket everywhere.	pos
These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).   ---  --- I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot	neg
that this great music sounds so awful on this CD. ---  --- I wanted an introduction to Kate Bush's music, and this CD seemed a very good way to start.  When I put it on, I couldn't believe how muffled and dull it sounded.  I could swear I'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton. ---  --- I went to the existing reviews here on Amazon, and, sure enough, Ferrara Brain Pan's spot-on review stated exactly what I was feeling upon listening to these recordings. ---  --- It is inexcusable that an artist of Bush's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame, considering how good the songs are. ---  --- Another little beef is that the CD clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words, there's room for 30 more minutes of music, which I'm certain could have been well-used, considering the vastness of her catalogue. ---  --- I will be looking for the remastered individual albums, but if I didn't know how good Kate Bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection, I wouldn't bother buying any more of her material. ---  --- Shame on EMI for allowing this.  I give it two stars (instead of one) simply because the music is so very good	neg

This clock was very easy to set up...pop in a battery and within 5 minutes it sets itself. It's large face and numbers are easy to read at a distance, making it perfect for business use. It was only a few dollars more than a clock with no automatic time setting, so it was worth it to me to have at least one clock I'll only have to check when the battery wears down	pos

I love this magazine and I look forward to getting it in the mail every single week, unless if the last one was a double issue. Then I have to wait another whole week, which can sometimes be painful. I love the reviews and the magazine is funny, fresh and it keeps me up to date on movies, TV, music, and DVDs. The onlt complaint I have is lately they don't have as many reviews for urban releases	pos
I found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing.  That's about it.  This mag seems to be biased towards certain products & manufacturers.  They neglected to open my eyes wider.  The reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies (microsoft, dell, etc). They don't give credit to smaller, better, less-well-known companies and technologies.  All the info is pretty basic for intro users, but if that's what you are interested in... then this is a great non-comlicated publication	neg
This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it	neg

We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress.	neg

Good black tea is not hard to find - just hard to find in your grocery store.   ---  --- The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many, if any really good teas.  This, in particular, is one of their worst.  It is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately. ---  --- Every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice - tea, chai or steamed milk.  Every time i cave in and give Tazo another chance it disappoints me.  If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups.  Try a keemun, a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes.  If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a  --- Cameroonian black. ---  --- take it from someone who really loves tea, this stuff is not worth your time.  and when you get good tea, please don't brew it in your coffee maker	neg
You can get Mac OS X for 129 bucks and it has everything as opposed to the Microsoft's 227 dollar Home Premium which is the low end. Buy Mac and get all the functionality in one OS.

Even though I know it's important to eat breakfast, I seldom do it; I'd rather sleep a little longer. These breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem. I keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning...they're whole grain, nice and filling, and taste good to boot. They're also a nice treat on the way home. The Oats and Honey are my favorite, but the variety pack provides a nice change. All of the flavors are tasty: peanut butter, cinnamon, maple sugar - all yummy	pos
Bought my Go510 on November 14 as a Christmas present for the wife. It comes with only 90 days of warranty. Today is April 6 and the thing is broken.

I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money	neg
As far as GPS software goes, there is nothing better available than Streets & Trips and AutoRoute.  There are dozens of features that you can't find with the self-contained GPS units.  It is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order, night-view is another great feature, as are the topographical maps.  The new feature offered this year, of easy-linking to satellite photos of places on the map, is also a welcome addition.   ---  --- The only reason I'm giving it a four is because of the following: ---  --- 1)  There is STILL no ground-level or 3D view of the roads for use in the GPS function ---  --- 2)  They still haven't added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them. ---  --- 3)  There isn't a lot of coverage for Eastern European countries, most notably, nothing in Russia. ---  --- Nonetheless, it is still better than any other GPS software on the market	pos

I ordered this product and put it in my Nikon D200.  The product was improperly manufactured, and caused the pins in my camera to bend, rendering it inoperable.  I had no idea what the cause was, and went to my camera store, and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well. ---  --- We took a quick look at the card, and the holes were obviously improperly aligned.  The damage to the cameras was repairable, and the replacement card I received worked ok, but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment	neg

This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.  --- Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror	neg
I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam.  It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance.  I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses.  Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them.  I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it.  I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware.  Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems.  I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam.  I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement.  --- My only complaint is the rebate- I sent in the required info and it was rejected due to "invalid/missing UPS."  I then sent a copy of the UPS they indicated that was missing, but never got anything back.	pos

About 18-24 months ago, we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter, child-toddler size 12-13, like those pictured. She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape! Also, daughter's mother has been wearing her own pair, for similar uses, for about two years. So, we highly recommend CROCS	pos

i think that logitech make the best accessories.  I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer.

Don't you find that strange?  Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model).  In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you. --- 	neg

You owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the Cree XR-E LED.  It's roughly TWICE as bright as the currently comparable Luxeon LED.

This is an amazing DVD. I read reviews online all the time saying "anyone will like this", but seriously. I even showed it to my mother who laughed.

So, I've owned a tweezerman extractor before, and I am now questioning why I didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar...This extractor is no help what so ever. the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that I would press the right pore. its just too small to even target. the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful, you could damage your skin. i would recommend not buying this extractor. i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman..	neg

When I first tried this Marshmallow Vanishing Crème in a sampler kit, I purchased five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this product. Can I say it is addictive?  ---  --- Yes, I guess it does have a banana cream pie scent and the texture is similar to a banana cream pie topped with whip cream. To say this is decadent is an understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire body in a good helping of this cream.  ---  --- Fortunately, it goes a long way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it "vanishing" crème. The ingredient list is impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax, grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract, willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady fragrance. ---  --- Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure. ---  --- "Marsh Mallow" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled the roots in wine to make a cough remedy. ---  --- I found this luscious creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal.  ---  --- If you love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask, Evening Primrose Overnight Crème and the very unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level, try the Shea Butter Decollete Crème on your feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind. ---  --- I'm still trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products make me feel. They add a level of protection to your skin care routine and the clay mask I recently tried cleaned my pores like a dream. ---  --- ~TheRebeccaReview.co	pos
In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.  ---  --- Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.  ---  --- You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ..	pos
We received a Graco travel system from our registry, and got some good use out of it. However, we are in a big city, and the stroller just couldn't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads. Not to mention it was so rickety I'm positive we could be heard a mile away. I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger, and I LOVE it.  ---  --- 1. It was simple to assemble. --- 2. It is easier on my hands and wrists to steer. --- 3. The air-filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter. --- 4. The toy steering wheel? She FREAKS out over it, in a good way. She *beeped* her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store. Since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves, I am ultra pleased.  --- 5. The price is wonderful. ---  --- We don't use the Music On The Move feature, so I can't really comment on it. I fill the tires right before we leave the house every time, and it's not hard to do, so I have no complaints there.  ---  --- It is a bulky item, so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky. However, the pros all outweigh the cons for me. I am extremely pleased with it	pos

I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now. ---  --- After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.   ---  --- One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time. ---  --- ===== One month later ===== --- I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good	neg

I've been a subscriber of E Magazine (which stands for The Environmental Magazine) for over a year now and I love it. It is, by far, the best environmentally oriented magazine I've come across.

E Magazine covers topics all over the world, including global warming, horse meat (popular in Europe), whaling, deforestation, etc. If you are concerned or interested in environmental issues, I would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine.

I once read an article in Horn Book Magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of Hans Christian Andersen polluting the minds of our young people today.  The review mentioned that stories like, "The Snow Queen", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of "The Snow Queen" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life. ---   --- Most people don't remember that "The Snow Queen" begins when the devil creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad.  By a quirk of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into the atmosphere.  If these splinters enter your eye, everything will look ugly to you.  If they enter your heart, it will turn instantly to ice.  Got it?  Good.  Cause sure enough, two small pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai.  When this happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and magnificently pale Snow Queen.  Gerta goes in search of her friend but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures.  She escapes an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess, falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself.  By the end of the book, neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they left it. ---   --- Obviously "The Snow Queen" is one big ole story about growing up.  The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old tale, "East of the Sun, West of the Moon", in which another girl goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a wicked woman.  Heck, "Tam Lin" was probably an influence as well.  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara Dalkey.  It was a tale named, "The Lady of the Ice Garden" and can be found in "Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction and Fantasy".  It is not, however, appropriate for children.  Kids today will probably look at "The Snow Queen" and instantly think of the White Witch from "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe".  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing.   ---   --- As for the Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right.  As an illustrator, Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely children.  I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair.  There is the odd stylistic choice here and there, though.  When Gerta surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower petals.  I can't think that they're comfortable (or even particularly practical).  The illustrations have been created, according to the book, "using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then erased".  As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil, but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with pen and ink. ---   --- Obviously I don't know enough about the original version of "The Snow Queen" (or, as Andersen called it, "Sneedronningen") to know whether or not this book is a worthy version to read to your tots.  At any rate, it tells the full story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be the most Freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little brains.  A fun edition of a rather odd tale	pos
This was the first brand of nursing pads I tried.  My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy.  Yet after trying several brands of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh.

I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone	pos

We bought this for a trip we will be taking in May but when my daughter saw it she got in it immediately.  She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it.  The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me.  This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now.  It is easy to open, shut and lock.  I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though.  I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright.  The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also.  	pos
No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured	pos
I was very pleased when I saw just how beautiful this car seat was. Now that my daughter is 3 months old I feel I can give it a review. I read many things about complaints but I just don't have any. Everything works well on it. It doesn't fit well in all carts but carts weren't made for baby carriers to fit in them so it's not a bad thing about the car seat itself. All infant carriers will have the same problem. I recommend this to anyone who wants an infant carrier and likes how it looks. It's pretty and fits great in it's stroller. All in all, it's a great buy. Although my next time around, I'm passing up the infant carrier and going Britax. They're much safer imo from what I've read and heard	pos
I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.  I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time.  It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton! I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers, a travel wipes container, a small changing pad, a couple of spare onsies, a nursing shawl, 2 washcloths for spit up, an extra receiving blanket, a 4 oz bottle of cleanser, phone, lipstick, keys and wallet, and that is only in the main compartments.  The only proplem I've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it.  I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect	pos
I really really really really like Allison Moorer.  Have been a fan since her first record, have road-tripped to see her numerous times, and love her songwriting and singing. ---  --- That said -- "Getting Somewhere" is by far the least satisfying of her records.  No memorable songs.  Over-produced.  No "guts", as another reviewer said. ---  --- When the Allison Moorer/Doyle "Butch" Primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one), their Lennon/McCartney-caliber teamwork was lost.  Not that Moorer sounds like The Beatles, but Allison and Butch complemented each other well when composing music.   ---  --- This CD is not only unmemorable but I doubt I would care to ever listen to it again.  Such a shame.  I've never had anything negative to say about Allison in the 8 years I've been a fan.  But this CD left me cold. ---  --- It hurts a bit to say this, but I cannot recommend this CD. ---  ---  --- The closest analogy I can think of that relates to how different this CD is from her earlier work is the B-story line from an episode of "The Larry Sanders Show".  In that episode, Sanders' head writer Phil (played by Wallace Langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy.  As a result he lost his edge.  When he was a miserable person he was an edgy, cynical, funny jokewriter.  When he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job.      Same with Moorer.  Since her recent changes in her social life she has started "singing a sweeter tune" in her life, but it came with a cost.  She doesn't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that "other" songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy, sad, sometimes bitter, or at least that's how I interpreted it.  Granted, that wasn't her entire oeuvre, but it is what made her songs special for me.  Now she's happy and she might as well be writing songs for Barney the Dinosaur	neg

Bought this crib tent after reading all the "fine print" about returns.  Besides, toilet seats etc. which Allegro Medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons, Allegro Medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days.  Not when I tried to return this.  Allegro Medical said all returns were "up to their discretion".  They would not allow me to return this despite the fact I didn't even open the box.  Very misleading & will never buy from Allegro Medical again	neg
the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient.  It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact.  Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter.  this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them.  I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said " I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal "	pos
This marble maze looks so fun and cute. However, it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. The pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. Also, the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. Either our giraffe is missing a critical piece, or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. Ugh, I'm returning this immediately	neg
My 8 year old daughter brought this book home from her school library and was excited by many of the projects.

Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent. ---  --- Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it. ---  --- If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds	pos
I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house	neg
I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle.

The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next	neg

This is an excellent story well told in script and action. However, it is quite different from the version I saw on a big theater screen.

I loved this magazine in 1995, until a few years ago.  They have changed editors a few times and now it is not even worth reading the ads. ---  --- No new information.

They've changed too over the last few years, but still a far sight better than this one	neg
How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding	neg

First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars. Sound offensive? It is. And this film is equally insulting to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism (the three big ones in China). --- Confucius, a man revered these past 2500 years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in Lost Empire as a lecherous,traitorous,lying,cowardly weasel. --- The Jade Emperor,Taoism's chief God, is shown as a despondent,apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms. --- Kuan Yin, one of the Bodhisattvas, is shown in Lost Empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man. That is as likely as the Virgin Mary turning tricks on a street corner. --- If some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda as a clever adventure-fantasy they could not easily do better than The Lost Empire. It makes me wonder if the insult was intended.	neg

These lights don't hold a charge.  I called the manufacturer and they said that these are "summer/spring" lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work.  The ad on Amazon did not say that.

I am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch, I purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall/winter mix:  cilantro, basil, parsely, thyme, savory, sage and oregano.  The basil, thyme, savory and oregano are from the new Italian Herb kit. ---  --- Everything I've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time.  The savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch, but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since I started.  The basil is the first to sprout. The parsely seems to be slow but steady.   ---  --- Your herbs will be good for at least six months.  With proper care, I'm sure you could extend their life.  These are very easy to care for and it's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal. ---  --- I recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and/or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past	pos

The sugar was perfect, I ordered it to go on a cookie I make only at Christmas time.  The cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long.  You try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it, it has a tapered look.  You leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree.  When they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky, you sprinkle the sugar on.  They came out beautiful, I then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company, they think I am soooooo talented and it is so easy	pos
I rec'd this today.  I had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from Bulova. (I looked for nearly two years!)  I did some looking around online and in stores and Amazon by far had the best price (they beat everyone by at least $100), so I did what any girl would do, I bought it.   ---  --- It is a substantial watch. It's not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming. I don't think it's heavy, it just feels like you've got a watch on.  I personally like the size and weight.  I plan on this being my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens to it.  I have a Seiko Coutura with a black MOP face w/diamonds that I love, but I wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it. 	pos

I have read reveiws before i bought it that said the trimmer "pinches" or cut people, but i haven't found that to be the case. I wouldn't use it in ultra sensitive places (but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially dangerous near sensitive areas) but it does the trick quite well.  I have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a good price.  It also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver (which wasn't advertised when i bought it) but worked well on my legs; not as great as some more expensive  electric leg shavers but is great when you don't have much time.  All in all i suggest buying it.  	pos

With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained. --- Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie	neg

I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.  IT IS NOT!!!!  Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress.  Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed.  Beware of this seller!  I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description.  Believe me - it was there before	neg
This thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours.  Characters weren't given clear introductions or motivations, they react in ways that don't make much sense and the accents come, go, and change into new accents altogether.  While the format reminds me of a primetime soap, the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime: which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	neg

I have been a long time subscriber to Vogue Knitting, it was one of the few US knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns. I am from Germany, where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns, I missed that when I moved to the US. However, I find that the content in Vogue Knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs, sometimes, it was just too far out and there wasn't a single pattern I wanted to knit. I stopped my subscription for a while. Then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky, yet still chic and fun. I still enjoy reading it every once in a while.  ---  --- After having my daughter, I changed my subscription to Family Circle Easy Knitting, since Vogue Knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids, which I really find a shame. I even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission. Especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them! The German magazines do a great job of having some unique, but still fun kids designs.  ---  --- If you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns (some very expensive), then Vogue Knitting is the magazine for you. If you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional, but still challenging, I would suggest Interweave Knits and Rebecca (English version of a German magazine), both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns. If you have kids, there isn't much out there, I would suggest Family Circle Easy Knitting, also Rebecca does a kids issue once a year, which should not be missed	pos

Amazon rebate is a scam.  I purchased this headset on 1/23/2007, and received it on 1/25/2007.  However, the RebatesHQ site was not functioning on 1/25/2007.

After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a "snap shot" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR. 	neg

The versions of "Black Sabbath" and "War Pigs" actually comprise half of Black Sabbath's appearance on the April 26, 1970 edition of John Peel's 'Sunday Show.'  "Black Sabbath" features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song.  "War Pigs" is actually "Walpurgis," an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics.  Incidentally, the other two songs from that broadcast, "Fairies Wear Boots" and "Behind the Wall of Sleep," were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release.  All four of these tracks, while fascinating, don't rightfully belong on this collection, as this disc intends to highlight Ozzy Osbourne's career as a solo artist.  For that reason, the live version of "Paranoid" that appears on this set is equally unnecessary. ---  --- Those songs are frustrating inclusions on an Ozzy Osbourne greatest hits album, particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of Ozzy's biggest hits and/or notable tracks such as "Flying High Again," "Shot in the Dark," "I Don't Know," "Breaking All the Rules," or "Road to Nowhere." ---  --- To add to the confusion, some of the solo-era material included here isn't exactly what it purports to be.  Ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties.  These disputes ostensibly prompted Ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with, in some cases, re-recorded tracks.  The 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts, presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of Lee Kerslacke (drums) and Bob Daisley (bass), who, incidentally, wrote the lyrics to almost every Ozzy solo track from 'Blizzard of Ozz' through 'No More Tears.'  The 'Bark at the Moon' album, while not re-recorded, was most certainly remixed.  It is the re-recorded versions of the 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman' tracks and the remixed version of the 'Bark at the Moon' track that appear on the current edition of this collection.  Finally, the version of "No More Tears" is actually the video edit, not the album version. ---  --- In addition, due to one of the disputes mentioned above, 'The Ultimate Sin' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from Ozzy's catalog.  That album's biggest hit, "Shot in the Dark," which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection, has now been replaced with "Miracle Man" from 'No Rest for the Wicked.'  Along these lines, the 'Just Say Ozzy' live EP and the double-disc live album, 'Live and Loud,' both of which contain a live version of "Shot in the Dark," have also been deleted from Ozzy's catalog.  Not even 'The Essential Ozzy Osbourne,' a double-disc collection covering Ozzy's entire solo career, features a single song from 'The Ultimate Sin.'  The ultimate sin, indeed. ---  --- My recommendation is to avoid this collection (and the 2002 remasters) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or, better yet, search for the original albums on vinyl	neg

I am only an amateur photographer, but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an SLR film camer costing a lot more, and a lot more complicated to use. I caught the digital bug sevearl years ago. My latest before this beauty was a simple little Canon SureShot 3mp. A great camera, but this camera has the same simplicity, but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than I paid for that camera four years ago!! This Panasonic Lumix has a Leica Lens, which can' t be matched by any other camera but it's twin Leica camera--a much more expensive piece of equipment. The long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog, but if you want an all around 35mm-12X camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses, like me, this baby is for you. It only looks massive. It is quite lite and manageable. I use it for bird photographsy, but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution. Don't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera? This is the answer. I love it, and I think your will, too. Easy to use, and easy on the wallet. If you're not quite there, try the next model down, with the same focal length but 6 mp, for a couple hundred less. Another terrific buy. No, I don't work for Panasanic. I'm a retired print editor.  ---  --- Jim Isha	pos

China Glaze is my favorite polish, but perhaps it's because they are the only ones I've ever seen with this color #86, Your Touch.

The essence of painter Francis Bacon is not a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to take in life.  Seen through his central nervous system and eyes, we experience  his world of fragments, like collage pieces of existence.  The only place he could make those fragments whole was in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully realized human being, himself, together.  Tellingly, one of his best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job with his lover George in his paintings of George.  However, he has been unable to do that in his actual life lived with George!  That sums up Bacon, his art and his life, in a nutshell.  Bacon is not a person you will like but you will understand him and how the fragments of his existence made for great art.  Yet he is also the most alone person imaginable, something no amount of lovers and sordid excess could allay.  One of the very best films about an artist ever made.  You don't need to see the actual finished paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his paintings in his head that matter here.  If you want to see his paintings, you should be able to find page after page of them online in about a minute, or less, using any visual search engine	pos
I bought this set for my daughter. The bedding is such a poor quality, that my daughter won't sleep in her bed.  She says the sheets are itchy.  The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard.  I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	neg
These glasses are a great idea.  However, they do not work with long hair.  The back "strap" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair	pos
Jensen JM10 Anonymous Review I love these headphones!! The easy access volume control is right where I need it and I can turn it ON and OFF whenever I need to. They are a great value!

I love the look of this watch!  I have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date. ---  --- Originally I was attracted to the Seiko SKX173 which I came across first.  However I was concerned that the physical size of the Seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as I wanted.  ---  --- Later I found this Citizen watch which looks virtually identical, yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43, height 10.5mm vs 13.5), and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement. ---  --- It also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding Seiko. ---  --- The only negative I have encountered is that it (as well as the Seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap.  While this is more comfortable than I expected, it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt.	pos
Disclaimer:  I am not employed by or associated in any way with the game's publisher or developer.  I am just another consumer. ---  --- I put that disclaimer because people have a tendency to point out all the positive game reviews here as "planted by the developers".  That may be true in some cases, but, not here. ---  --- CivCity:Rome is not without it's flaws.  The mouse cursor bug is a known issue on high-resolution settings, and the game developers have acknowledged this and will be releasing a patch soon.  How this slipped by their beta testers is beyond me, but, I'll agree with some others here, it is nearly a game-breaker. ---  --- That aside, if you love things set in ancient Rome, like me, and if you love city builder (CB) PC games, like me, you'll absolutely love CivCity:Rome.  Don't be fooled by the title, the game has absolutely nothing to do with the Civilization series of games.  It is more like a blend of Caesar III and SimCity, with a heavy influence of Stronghold II thrown into the mix.   ---  --- I personally have spent many hours playing the game, on medium difficulty, and I find the interface and in-game advisors extremely easy to navigate.  Some have stated the game's interface is "clunky" and hard to navigate...I would love to know what game they are comparing CivCity:Rome to, because, the interface is slick and very easy to use. ---  --- Graphically, the game is beautiful to look at.  Those who say the graphics are dated are living in a fantasy world.  Just take a look at the screenshots!  Admittedly, the graphics are not as pretty as those in the upcoming Caesar IV game, but, they are very well done, especially on newer systems.   ---  --- The tutorial and the manual were both very generous and well done, the in-game voice acting is charming and appropriate, the gameplay is challenging and addictive, and the learning curve is about what you would expect for any city-builder.  I strongly suggest anyone interested in city-building games, and especially ancient Rome based games, to check this game out.  It is well worth the 40 bucks and you'll get many hours of enjoyment.  If you have a high resolution monitor, you may want to wait for the first patch, though. ---  --- Cheers	pos
This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree. You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter, so I'd suggest saving $50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car, which is actually faster than using this device.	neg
My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed.  The graphics are awful, some give me a headache.  The songs are awful--they all sound alike.  Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard.  The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly.  I've had it two weeks, and already I'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss.  I gave it two stars because my kids (ages 6 and 2) love it, but then again, they don't know any better.  I am using it to get better at DDR, but then I will invest in a better pad and game. 	neg
The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a  couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an "infant"' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up	neg
With his snarling, gritty guitar tones, swampy grooves, and scratchy vocals, C.C. Adcock makes butt-shakin' music that blends rockabilly, old-school Memphis R&B, New Orleans funk, Cajun dancehall tunes, and juke-joint blues. He's young, but no poseur: Having paid dues with Bo Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, Adcock knows rootsy textures like the back of his hand. But despite the tremolo guitar and slapped upright bass, this isn't a retro-sounding record. Adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous. Doyle Bramhall joins Adcock on two songs, and together they raise 6-string hell. Boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of attitude, Adcock's music is soulful, somewhat twisted, and deeply satisfying	pos
I don't own one yet; But I am buying one this week!  Although I am a diehard amazon customer.  I am NOT buying it here cause LOWES regular price is "half" what it is here.

I'd recommend it, BUT I would probably check around to see if it's cheaper in your area.	pos
This game looks like so much fun! I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to play as Shamu and swim around and stuff? I am very disappointed in the lack of screenshots and videos, I really think this game has potential. I've been a huge fan of Shamu ever since I was a little kid. Every summer when me and my family go to San Diego on vacation we always go and see him. I have at least ten Shamu stuffed animals on my bed. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to this game. Think about it, how many games allow you to go underwater and swim around as a creature that's home is the deep blue sea? None. With this game, I won't have to get my stuffed animals all wet when I take them in my bath with me and play around. Now if I want to pretend to be Shamu all I have to do is turn on my Gamecube! Ya see, if this game is advertised correctly it will definitely be one of the best games of the year. We need to spread the work about this	pos

I would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all!  This seemed like a good idea, but my little guy was kicking and moving all over.  It barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath.  It also says that it is for 0 months on up, but I definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit	neg
Musician's Friend ships orders very quickly and I got this bag together with my new dreadnought guitar within 3 days.  This bag is really well priced ($15) so it's a great deal.  It is built with very sturdy nylon which protects the guitar well.  The nylon is not very thick (about a third-inch), but it gets the job done.  It also has nice shoulder straps to allow carrying the guitar over your back.  The only weakness is that it does not have many/good pocket compartments.  It has a large pocket but the pocket cover is not tightly closed - it's closed with a strap, so things could fall out if you somehow get the bag upside down.  It also has a smaller pocket on top of the larger pocket - this pocket has a zipper and things will not fall out.  Overall a great bag for the price	pos

Flight from death is a "must see" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it!  --- 	pos

I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. --- While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: --- -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery --- -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. --- -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. --- -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. --- -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) --- -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. --- -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) --- -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. --- If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.	neg
I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.  --- I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong	neg

Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the "least best" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed	neg
Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3	neg
Some products lead to real improvement of your skin (retin A, exfoliators) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up. The sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement. ---  --- The Regenerist contains SILICONES that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup. Such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow's feet are smaller. If you really want to do a test, you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash. If during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works. You can't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello.... --- And another thing, a wrinkle can't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin doesn't produce collagen that fast (unless you cut it). ---  --- Paying $18 / 1.7 oz (retail price, its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better -  try Monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 OZ, $7 at CVS.  ---  --- I have been using Matrixyl(the active peptide in Regenerist) for 6 months in my own formulations (without silicones) and frankly speaking haven't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead. Currently there is only one study of the effects of Matrixyl conducted by Sederma - the MANIFACTURER of Matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...	neg

I'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is.

I was expecting to see a decent film by Bava, but after having seen about 5 of his films, I can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us. Most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story, this film is just like all the rest.  ---  --- There is no point to any of it, there is no plot and hardly any suspense, suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult, its quite tedious. Chris Lee is rather banal also, he doesn't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio, most of the cast is rather dull also, supposedly playing some ancient noble family, they look more like 1960's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid. The dialogue, what there is, is crude, probably written by a drunk Italian because there are so many mistakes, one example was when Lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says, "I can't have more ice cream!"  ---  --- So, I would suggest renting "Planet of the Vampires" because that is more enjoyable than this waste. Interesting character to note was "Lesmo", dubbed as the "European Peter Lorre" who doesn't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget.  --- 	neg
I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated.  ---  --- My advice: avoid SUNPAK like the Plague! ---  --- 	neg

But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure! ---  --- These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat). ---  --- Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen.	pos
I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price	pos
We bought this machine for a Christmas present for the inlaws, knowing I'd wind up installing it. The first disk played fine, but while I was eating lunch my father-in-law tried moving to a different CD. It wouldn't play. It'd go back to the first disk and play it fine. So, I shut it down, restarted on disk 2 and now it played fine, but wouldn't go back and play disk 1! I moved the disks around to other slots and still they skipped like an old-fashioned vinyl record with a scratch. Both CDs worked fine in another player. In the meantime, mother-in-law is busy putting her collection of CDs into groups for me to program.  --- Not this holiday season. This sucker's going back to the big box store from wence it came!	neg
I was expecting this book to be a great story, but very disappointed. I cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is. The book is insipid and dull,  has no flow, no story, or no plot. Let me present an example. I have read many insightful Newsweek articles by a writer Allan Sloan. For example, Sloan describes a Sprint merger event in this way, "If talk is getting cheaper, why did MCI WorldCom pay $115 billion to buy Sprint? The once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world. Can regulators handle the complex new order....."  It has a clear logical axis, and has a force to attract readers into it.  ---  --- But Jeter describes it like this,  "The merger announcement of WorldCom and Sprint spurred building activity around Worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity. The real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit....." It always presents off-center, trivial detail which makes a reader bored. 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact, like "the merger of company A & B raised the stock to $X" etc. There is no insight here.  ---  --- But unfortunately, unlike Enron scandal, there is no other book that centered on the Worldcom scandal. You would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in Newsweek or Business Week, if you have LexisNexis or EBISCOhost.	neg

So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him.

This high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies.  When screwing together the sections, I managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest.  Any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy.  This toy is very basic, the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth.  Invest in some power tools and make your own, I guarantee it would be better than this one	neg

ah... ---  --- um... ---  --- well, my brother picked this up not too long ago, and , well... --- it sucks! it's the WORST of the whole series! --- i thought it would have to do with the mask Michael wears in the others, but not a FICKEN THING!!!!!!!!!!!! ---  --- I gave it two stars because i liked the killing scene in the hospital, but then i took one because of how bad the rest was..	neg
On page 116, formula 6.1, the price formula for a bond is actually for a semiannual coupon bond, not as stated on the book, for annual coupon bond. --- As a consequence, the dv01, duration and convexity formula it states are for semiannual coupon bonds as well.  --- I think both Tuckman and Fabozzi's books have their own pros and cons. Tuckman's book touchs more on the trading, which is interesting. Although it could be less rigorous in terms of treating the formulas. I own both books.	pos
A very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love, happiness and meaning. The film takes place on new year's eve, 1981, and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party (which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through.) Elvis Costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third. The soundtrack is great--all late 70's early 80's pop and new wave. And the one who steals the show is Dave Chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point, dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way, on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to "get booty." (smiling at a girl is very important, as is avoiding talking about death--"Everyone knows they're gonna die someday, they just don't want to hear it from you.") Ben Affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor. Oh, and Courtney Love was actually bearable. All in all, a very smart, enjoyable ride	pos
I'm not kidding, it's worth every penny (though I must admit that I get it at a lower price from a secret supplier in Asia). After using this, you'll swear that you just got a hot oil/deep treatment done from a professional salon.  ---  --- I have chemically treated hair (relaxed, double process - colored & fine hair equals damaged hair), and this is the only conditioner that works for me. Another plus is, this is the only conditioner that elicits "your hair smells sooooo good" reaction from my boyfriend & daughter. ---  --- Surprisingly, even if it moisturizes my hair excellently, it still leaves it bouncy & with enough volume. ---  --- This lasts about 6 months if you use it once a week, so it's really not that expensive, especially if you substitute this for your regular deep conditioning treatment at the salon. ---  --- If you're still wary, try a smaller bottle	pos
I tried this last year, and by the second day I woke up in great pain. I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn't the juice that caused the pain the first time, and the same thing happened.  --- I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff	neg

Like I said I would, I finally got around to purchasing this CD. I especially like tracks 9-12. Cheap Trick is solid as always. I have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases. If I do have any criticism at all, it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled Trick riffs. I guess it's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. Anyway, there are some great tunes on this. Buy it like I did!	pos
This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation. ---  --- I think the toning section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights.  ---  --- Minna is a great instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD and I love that one.	pos
My daughter got this for her 6th birthday.  She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister.  One of them is using it all the time.  The 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her.  My 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD.  My 3 year old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what she can.  Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD.  I wish there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat	pos

When my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head/side wings, this pillow worked well.  It was propped well enough to support my son's head when he took a nap.  But when we had to switch him to a straight-back booster seat that had shallow head wings, this pillow was not usable at all	neg
The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase	neg
I immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  I wanted to savor it, and make it last.  Much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  It also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  I am soooo disappointed!!!	neg

...and it wasn't worth having to send it back.  Seriously.  I thought maybe it was the batteries, so I switched them.  No luck. It ran very, very slow, and then it just quit.  As another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use, it's my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism.  I will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I'll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash.  I have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it, so I know all their merchandise isn't shoddy.  Maybe I got a dud, considering many others' positive reviews.  I sure hope so	neg

This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller.

My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations	pos
I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic.

This software might be recommended if better utilities weren't out there. This one gives the user a sense of security, but when my system crashed, Fix-It couldn't. I dutifully put in the Rescue Disk, booted up on it, restored my earlier system, exited and rebooted. ---  --- Nothing. Before I'd been able to get into safe mode, but now nothing. So when I manually restored my system, guess which program got yanked? And it freed up a lot of system resources, too. (Had I known how much before, that alone would have soured me.) My system now runs faster and doesn't lag while typing. ---  --- Another small criticism: Even though Fix-It has automatic update for virus scans, I found more often than not I had to go to the VCom site and manually download the anti-virus files. No reason was ever given; I'd just get a message telling me to do it. Very inconvenient. ---  --- Also WARNING*WARNING: This program has strict activation. You can only have it on one computer, so forget putting it on your notebook computer.  ---  --- Finally, be careful when cleaning your registry. Look at every entry this suite wants to delete. If you run it on default, it may remove critical registry keys and settings. In fact, I'd use a different registry cleaner or some of the free ones.  ---  --- Fix-It has some great features, but not enough to make it worth the system resources and a system sluggish system. (Not to mention the anti-virus problem). Try System Mechanic instead.  --- 	neg
I have very mixed feeling about this tape.  When I bought it, I did not realize it was for new mothers.  I have Cindy's two previous workouts and love them both, so I purchased this without question.  Here are some random thoughts: ---  ---    --I enjoyed the different length workouts.  You don't always have 45 minutes to workout, even if you aren't a parent.   ---     ---    --These workouts are lead by Kathy Kaehler, not by Cindy like her other tapes.  I found Kathy uninspiring and uninteresting.  Cindy does not seem as familiar with this workout as she is with the Radu ones.  She is more "window dressing" in this video.   ---     ---    --The amount of repetitions for the movements varies greatly, which I found very annoying.   ---     ---    --The warm-up and cool-down are very, very short, even on the 40 minute Workout "C". ---     ---    --The music will put you to sleep.  I suggest hitting the "mute" button on your TV and listening to your own music. ---  --- If you are a new mother or beginner, this is a good tape to ease you into a workout routine.  However, I believe you will quickly outgrow it. ---   	neg

AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.  ---  --- Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co. ---  --- Stiff Upper Lip --- ~ AC/DC : 2 stars 	neg

Installing the software was a piece of cake, using it is quite another matter. The basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a PhD in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles, tweaks and options. First attempts? The moon came out real nice, but Saturn was a white blob with no fine detail. Nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the Celestron site. Will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well  --- (oh - was using it on a classic LX200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry Celestron!	pos
I just watched "Mommie Dearest" for the first time tonight. As most critics and fans of "Mommie Dearest" acknowledge, the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse, with such an over-dramatic (but entirely true-to-life) performance by Faye Dunaway, it was both hilarious and depressing.  I'm 30 and didn't know much about Joan Crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being "classic camp."  Seems to me Crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder.  I think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to. She knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do, whether it was having a successful marriage, a happy family, or even giving to charity. Her life was a running commercial directed by Hollywood, not unlike the tabloid-driven, image-obsessed Hollywood we have today. Despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling's victimization on film, Christina's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life. Christina Crawford was completely justified turning her mother's image on its head with her book and movie. Yes, the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering. After all, what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh. Mocking the unexplained, unjustified pain you experienced in the past, renders it powerless to harm your future. This is the legacy of "Mommie Dearest" whatever Joan Crawford really was	pos
My children absolutely love this version. They wake at 5 a.m. to play before school. My son says "it's great--I've learned lots of tips, and now I'm a much better chess player."  ---  --- Why a 4-star and not 5? The down-side--the game doesn't allow the player to "save" at a certain level--totally frustrates the kids when they want to return, they have to start at the beginning again	pos
I have to get on the bandwagon here.  This is a superb little camera, definately five stars!  I also have the TZ1, which showed promise, but has  limitations. In my review of the TZ1, I noted it had lots of "noise" and pictures shouldn't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp.  I also wanted more manual controls. ---  --- The TZ3 fixes and improves almost everything about the TZ1 and adds some new, very useful features.  The noise has been drastically reduced, the lens is better, the sensor is bigger, and the processor is not only faster, but produces better pictures.  The TZ3 adds a very handy "function" button - or I should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so "most used" settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several. ---  --- The TZ3 keeps the Mega Optical Image Stabilization and adds Intelligent ISO, increases the sensitivity without adding noise,(I have not tried the 3200 setting yet.), increases the size of the viewing screen, etc., etc. ---  --- The TZ3 is a "well-rounded," and very capable camera.  There is simply no comparison between the TZ1 and the TZ3 as far as the quality of the pictures.  The TZ3 wins hands down.  In my opinion it also beats some big name, higher priced digicams - a couple of which I own - rather handily.  ---   --- Of course, the big selling point for the TZ3 is still the 10X lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera.  This lens is SHARP, and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results. ---  --- While there are no manual controls, per se, the camera seems to do very well without them.  Pictures are sharp, exposures seem nicely done (haven't tried it at night yet, but low light forrest shots were excellent), colors were accurate, appropriately saturated, and vivid (OK.  I like the vivid setting.), good contrast, etc.  There are a variety of AF settings, settable focal points, and focus modes.  There is also exposure compensation, and exposure bracketing available - and they work well!  The live histogram is a welcome bonus.  The TZ3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent, sharp results.  The TZ3 is very well speced out.   ---  --- One nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the TZ1.  It was  really not to inconvenient, but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake.  The TZ3 lens includes an built in lens cover.  Very welcome. ---  --- I currently own five top flight digicams (including this one), and have owned about that many others, I am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results.  It is a quantum step forward. ---  --- I also have a couple of quite nice, and fairly complete DSLR kits.  They are wonderful, and in a class by themselves, but when I want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10X, wide angle lens, or a back up for the DSLRs, the TZ3 is now my camera of choice. 	pos

RKO filed for bankruptcy in the mid-1930's and was on the verge of finally getting back on their feet financially by 1940. I suspect that someone from their cost accounting group wandered into the studio commissary in 1939 and found it full of under-contract actors and production staff goofing off and eating studio food. They rounded up this group, stuffed the whole bunch onto an unused sound stage (with a leftover southwestern set) and got them singing and dancing to songs from a Rogers and Hart Broadway show (which they had an option on but had deemed unworthy of feature film treatment). ---  --- The result was released as "Too Many Girls" (1940), financially practical because with almost everything already paid for (insert fixed cost here), the additional expense of actually producing something boiled down to a little electricity and some black and white film stock.  ---  --- No good reason to track this one down, it's pretty witless as a comedy-with the miscasting making for funnier moments than anything else in the film. Everyone except Ann Miller is too old to be playing college students and they try to pass Hal Le Roy (one of Hollywood's most effeminate actors) off as a college football All-American. I generally like this kind of stuff and will sit through anything to watch Ann Miller; so if it totally turned me off it is unlikely to appeal to most viewers. ---  --- Mostly it is notable for what happened off camera as Lucy and Desi made their first connection.  ---  --- Some of the musical numbers by Rodgers and Hart were bearable; "Heroes in the Fall" and "Pottawatomie". Trudy Erwin dubs Lucy's only song. Francis Langford does most of the other numbers.  ---  --- Mildly wild heiress Connie Casey (Lucille Ball) returns from finishing school in Europe with an unusual request to attend her father's alma mater in New Mexico-Pottawatomie College. "You mean a lot to me, Pottawatomie. You hit the spot of me, Pottawatomie. I love Pottawatomie with all my anatomy. So every tot of me, that is begot of me, will go to Pot, Pot, Pottawatomie".  ---  --- Lucy was almost 30 at the time and even with "extreme" soft focus and minimal close-ups can't remotely pass for 18.  ---  --- Her father suspects that she has a boyfriend at the school and hires four Ivy League football stars to monitor the behavior of the new freshman. The four eventually end up playing for the school's hapless football team, which in a matter of a few days has changed its schedule to include games with big time programs like Nebraska, Columbia and Tennessee. There is a grand celebration at which the student body sings the following less-than-immortal lyrics: "You're a ham-better scram-Notre Dame, We'll make Williams wail, Army-you too Navy, Boo Hoo to Purdue, Georgia Tech day you'll dread-you're a wreck, Look at Brown turn blue, We'll make a bumpia out of Columbia, In a quota Minnesota's got to go, You'll see U of D, We'll have all the alphabet to shout out." (reviewers note: the U of D is the University of Detroit which was once a football power). ---  --- The scale of this thing is ultimately its undoing as Broadway ensembles of 15 are replaced with a cast of hundreds (remember all those people sitting in the RKO commissary drawing paychecks for doing nothing). On risquï¿½ Broadway the girls who are still virgins wear beanies; in the film they wear them to signify that they have never been kissed (it is amusing to watch these aging and jaded RKO starlets trying to pass for ultra-chaste teens). ---  --- There is a corny and unconvincing romance between Lucy and Richard Carlson; whose brand of wooden acting would eventually work to his advantage in 1950's science fiction films like "It Came From Outer Space".  ---  --- Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child	neg

For someone who knows little about Bach and wants to learn something, you couldn't do better than to give them this CD.  Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra give their signature warm, plush sound to the work of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, making him sound very nearly like a Romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer.  This is not a bad thing--some complain that Bach, with his mathematical leanings, leaves them cold.  That isn't possible with the inviting material on this CD	pos

With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has great transfers, but few interesting extras	pos

The size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there. I put the swing on the 5th speed and it barely moves, so much for the other 4 speeds.  ---  --- My daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what I hate most about this swing. My daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing, looking like she is going to fall out. I just pray that buckle is secure! She also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars. So, I don't like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing. If you don't like to get house work done or take showers, this swing might be for you	neg
I bought this product to hang a 42" LCD. --- I am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns.  The mount is only 32" wide.  The "virtual axis" tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me.  There are only two tilt options with this mount, vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree.  Being 32" wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16" centers.  Make sure you get at least 2 studs.  My experience is this mount does not support VESA 400x800mm pattern.  800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart.  My TV did have another attaching pattern but I had to use the M5 bolts (provided with mount).  I would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where I could use the thicker M8 bolts.  A 42" LCD isn't going to weigh as much as a 50"+ TV, so take that into consideration.  I am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy.	pos
My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading.  --- Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money	neg
Excellent case, no question about it. It is stylish and well-put together. This can not be worn on a belt, though, it must go in a pocket, purse, or in your hand. The main thing is that it keeps the awesome camera safe and sound, and it looks good doing it.	pos
This movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books. Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on. The best way to watch this movie is in the background. You don't need the visuals, and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away	neg

This smoker provides an inexpensive way to get into real barbecue.  I find that it runs on the hot side with a full load of charcoal, so it's better for ribs than something like brisket or a pork shoulder.  Still, what I've made so far is miles ahead of trying to smoke on a Weber kettle grill	pos

I didn't give this pail 1 star because it does keep the stink out, and it does take standard garbage bags.   ---  --- After a few months of use, the spring assembly on the blue cover popped off.

I just purchased a MoGo mouse, and I'm *amazed* at how usable it is.  I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is.  The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of "scroll-wheel" technology.  That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse. ---  --- That said, there are always trade-offs, but in this case that's the only one.  Battery life seems great, usability is great, convenience is great...just add the touch pad and it'll be THE mouse for notebook computer users!	pos

First, let me say that Ahmad tea is great tea for the price.  This is not quite the same thing as great tea, but given the "price/performance" of Ahmad tea, I should rightly rate it four or even five stars. ---  --- So why only two stars? ---  --- Amazon claims you'll get the following six teas in each pack:  "Ceylon Orange Pekoe; English Breakfast; Earl Grey; Darjeeling; English No. 1; Jasmine Green" ---  --- But instead of Jasmine Green, I got English Afternoon tea. ---  --- What you might not realize is that Ahmad's English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 contain Bergamot.  This is a citrus oil used to make Earl Grey, which is also included.   ---  --- English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 are both Earl Greys.  The bergamot might be slightly weaker than in a traditional Earl Grey, but it's still obviously there.  So half of this package is Earl Grey. ---  --- I don't really like Earl Grey tea.   ---  --- If you really like Earl Grey teas, you might enjoy this.  Otherwise stay far away	neg
The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review	neg

Most serious directors and actors aspire to a level of professionalism that seems effortless to the point of casual.  Like the best baseball outfielders catching swirling flyballs with a nonchalant jog and a flick of the wrist.  On the other hand, Kinski and Herzog want you to feel every moment of effort, every muscle twitch, the oppresive heat, the mind-numbing glassy eyed exhaution,  the dangerous waters, & the sleepless nights. Watching this movie, I can easily imagine the furious arguments and sullen bitterness of men pushed to their creative and physical limits. They suffered to make this movie and they want you to know it.  Herzog's actors tolerate conditions and exertions far beyond the call of duty and for what?  To make a flick.  Aguirre's men tolerated far more for gold most didn't live to see.  At the heart is the titular character, played by Kinski as a wild eyed wraith more dead than alive as he descends into an utter madness as a refuge against the ordeal and death he presides over.  To know anything about Kinski is to know that Aguirre is not a terrible stretch for him.  If anything, his performance is more brave in its selfexamination than creative in its acting chops. Herzog, for his part, seems to be a good old-fashioned meglomaniac as he appears to derive great satisfaction from pushing his cast and crew far beyond normal limits and treating them like little toy people so he can be a rich famous director. He has a singular vision and is determined to see it on the screen, no matter what.  He is a throwback to the American studio director/petty tyrants like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock (a gentleman tyrant who referred to actors as cattle), Michael Curtiz and many others.  Herzog is determined to control and Kinski resists control and their collaborations are the output of a kind of two brained insane but brilliant filmmaker. Aguirre is almost two movies.  One is a brillant study of madness and ordeal and the other is an equally fascinating, if unintentional, documentary of two difficult half mad professional collaborators making a great movie often in spite of themselves	pos
I read this book from cover to cover and was fascinated by the information it provided both in scientific and in laymen terms. I started drinking Himalayan Goji Juice shortly after, in hopes of improving my poor night vision.

I love my Cayman Crocs. My sister swore by these shoes, but I wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer, but I'm practical and they can only go with so many things.  --- I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. I'm not at all disappointed. They really don't look bad paired with casual outfits.  --- I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. It's not so much that you slip them on and say "wow this feels great" ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. I think they are great ... even with the "different" look ... though I do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point	pos
Of all teas I've tried, this is my favorite; sweet, powerful, and fragrant, MarketSpice is the answer for many moods and cravings.  I prefer this tea hot, steeped for 5+ minutes, but its good cold as well-although I've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming.  Be warned: if you only like very subtle white teas, this may not be for you . . . but it has converted many a non-tea-drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts	pos

This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every penny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it	pos

We have an original Hatteras Rope Hammack which we purchased when we lived in North Carolina. I love it but the rope tends to stretch too much and requires rehanging to tighten it. We were informed that it would when we purchased it four years ago, but now it seems to be more work than it is worth. The solid quilted design seems like it would be better and would require less maintenance. Also, our poodle-mix pet just loves it. She would try to jump in before we could even get it hanged. We had to attach a cover to it to keep her paws from going through the ropes, so that adds to the value of the solid design.Thanks for listening to me and we plan on purchasing the guilted hammack as soon as possible	pos

This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair.  I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair.  However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything.  I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage.  Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair.  If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs	pos
Shannon Lawson is capable of a much better album.  I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing!  If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites.  Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD.  Instead they gave it this generic, overproduced sound, leaving Shannon sound like everyone else.  With the way bluegrass is selling these days, it's a shame that Shannon couldn't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena..	neg
This book is a rare but insightful look into the practice of one of the New Urbanist legends. UDA began the pattern book revival a decade ago (and also has a book out describing the process of writing one.) They also are one of the pioneers of the New Urbanist revolution, which, by discarding the fictions of Modernist planning, have rediscovered existing methods and have discovered new methods of creating compact, mixed-use and walkable neighborhoods that were always the basic cellular structure of cities from the dawn of time until just before World War II. We have understood the basic principles again for some time. What this book shows are some of the mechanics of how to do it again	pos
Just like a big chunk of us right now, I'm quite the sudoku addict. I just can't put those little puzzles down! So, I have to tell you first, if you haven't worked sudoku puzzles yet, you are really missing out! Get your hands on some! ---  --- Naturally, I was excited to try out a sudoku game and race against my friends to solve the puzzles. But what a disappointment! One small board, several people straining to see it, everyone racing to fill in the puzzle...it just doesn't work. ---  --- The way they designed this game was to have a board, which is the puzzle to be solved, and number tiles that you distribute evenly amongst the players. Everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle, and the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner, assuming the puzzle is solved correctly. ---  --- First of all, if you have more than 2 people playing, the players aren't all going to be able to see the board well. Some people are going to have the board upside-down trying to solve it. That's rough! Talk about getting confused between 6s and 9s! Plus, everyone's hands are in the way while they're laying their tiles, which makes it really hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle. ---  --- Next, inevitably in the games I've played someone lays a tile wrong. Then the whole game is thrown off. The instructions say that if someone rids themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly, then the next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are correct. Most likely, if one person has made an error, that will have caused a chain reaction and the next person's tiles will also be placed wrong, and not necessarily by fault of either of the players. It could have been anyone who started the chain reaction. ---  --- The format just doesn't work for this game. My advice is to pass on this particular game. Perhaps a game where people were racing side-by-side on the same puzzle, but with their own puzzle, would work better	neg
Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.  ---  --- Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.  ---  --- Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.  ---  --- Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to "the call of the wild," becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed	pos

The great thing about this "movie version" is that all the original voices of Clifford (John Ritter), Emily Elizabeth, Cleo, and T-Bone are exactly the same as the Clifford episodes on TV. Basically, it is a longer version of a regular Clifford episode but they've added a few new friends and some songs here and there. Speaking of, the songs are actually upbeat and a bit catchy.  But NOT so catchy to where I find the tunes stuck in my head for hours........unlike some other kid movies (i.e. - Thomas the Tank Engine) where they play the same droning chorus over and over and over again. This movie is a great compromise because my 2 and a 1/2 year old son LOVES it, and after watching it with him numerous times now, I still like it too. 	pos
    "Incredible" I saw one review describing this production.  The meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is NOT incredible.  It is slow, convoluted and uninspired.  No chemistry exists between the actresses, with no connection to the audience.    	neg
I just purchased the small bottle(Thank God) of the Ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  It seems like it made my hair a little softer, but the smell is horrendous.

I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child.  I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it.  You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere.  Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.	neg
Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious!

I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!

This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use	pos

For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house. ---  --- On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess	neg

I had been waiting 3 years for any manufacturer to market a camera similar in specification to the Canon EOS1. As exploration Health, Safety & Environment advisor, work takes me to middle of the desert or the oceans. The wait was for 35mm film quality, with speed of picture taking (5 frames per second is barely enough to capture dolphins - hence the 8 + fps of the EOS 1 was desired). There was a parallel wait for an Image Stabilised 28-300 zoom lens. ---  --- Let's cut the story short. If I want a camera to bring on holiday, it would not be this one - the battery and charger are too heavy and bulky; instead I would choose the EOS20D without hesitation. ---  --- But having hundreds of failed 35mm film frames I decided not to wait any longer but to buy the EOS1D Mark II because the 1Ds Mark II is not fast enough at 4 frames a second. ---  --- With 35mm cameras, after a few seconds on the shooting, I would have to run back inside to the cabin (of a ship) to change film. If there is large enough memory card in the EOS1DII, there is no need. This camera is built with seals against the environment (and so does the 28-300mm lens). Instead of being scared of running out of film, now it is easy to keep the shutter button pressed while panning (and hoping) the dolphins do their jumps into the air. ---  --- With the 28-300mm lens attached, there is no need to change lenses either. Dolphins riding the bow wave of the ship could be captured at 28mm while those further away could be caught with 300mm setting. ---  --- It is a disappointment that the battery is not LiOn but the older NiMH. But as with any photo gear requiring a battery it is wise to have a spare, whatever the substance. I just wish Canon package a small travel size charger instead of the standard one which is very bulky. It has connections for two batteries (yet it could only charge one following the other) but most people would be happy using one battery while the other one is being charged. You just try to convince some airport officials to let you on the plane with the above kit, binoculars, laptop, mobile phone, GPS.......ext. hard disk....as hand luggage. ---  --- For work, I am committed and therefore bear the weight and troubles of hauling the hardware. But for holidays, I would choose the EOS20D with built-in flash because who would want to lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun and possibly a tripod? ---  --- The camera gets 4.5 stars but the battery and charger lets it down. Why just 4.5 stars ? One of the beauties I had thought with digital SLR was not having to do anything in processing, just transfer the images to the computer. Wrong. The .jpg straight out of the camera is not sharp enough. Post processing is required. Why ? Why is that necessary when the Canon S60 (which I use for different assignments (with underwater housing)) doesn't need to ? That defeats the point of having a .jpg file at 5.5 Meg when the 1.5 Meg of the S60 looks sharper straight out of the camera ? Still, there is RAW if the standard output is not suficient. ---  --- Incidentally, the EOS1DsII also produces 5.5 Meg .jpg and those also require post processing. For those of us who are not interested in working longer than necessary (me) 16.7 Million Pixels would seem a bit wasted. ---  --- I am still waiting for the camera which produces sharp .jpg files in-camera without having to post process, and can shoot at 8+ fps with a sensor size equivalent to 35mm film. Meantime I shall have to learn to shoot with RAW files and post process. ---  --- Also incidentally, the sensor size of the EOS20D is smaller, which means although itself is lighter than the EOS1D series camera, having to carry around an extrawide lens is not my idea of fun on holiday. The magnification ratio for the EOS1DII is 1.3 whereas the EOS20D is 1.6. This means I could still travel reasonably light (compromise) with the 1DII and 28-135mm IS lens attached. Sure it is possible to use stitching but that is more time spent at the computer and time is precious. ---  --- Any regrets ? None what-so-ever. It is state of the technology at the moment. Another benefit of using digital is that, it doesn't matter if you had been shooting ISO 100 all day. come the night if you want to shoot the rig with a moon as backdrop, just change to ISO 1600 without having to bother about "pushing2 the film in developing. It's a beauty when an IS L lens is attached. You'd need IS when there is machinery vibrations and the ship is moving with the swell ! Good job Canon. Now you need to shoe horn in a more capable CPU (to process the images in-camera), fit the 1DsII sensor into this one or this motordrive into the 1DsII and you may persuade me to part with more cash.	pos
I'm a first home buyer so with the nice weather coming up i decided that i needed a grill... so I wanted something that I could smoke too so the char broil smoker seemed like the ideal grill. assembly was simple. took about 30 min.

I agree that the Denver reviwer is totally out to lunch. This doll greatly resembles my daughter's friend Jenny Liu. Jeeny  was born in Taiwan.

Good lord, but this was awful. Normally A&E makes a mean costume drama, but /Benedict Arnold/ stank like rotting poultry.  The dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic, the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo-mo to cover up the lack of extras, and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap Halloween shop (with the exception of the military uniforms, especially the Continentals', which were accurate). Aidan Quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used "historical voice" (the lame semi-British accent affected by actors in costume drama).  Kelsey Grammer was pretty darn good as Washington, but his lines were horrid, horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade-school history text. Worst of all were the simpering John Andre and Peggy Arnold, whose rose-garden courtship scene was laughably bad.  In short, don't even bother to rent this.

This book shows in detail how much of the media has gone out of its way to attack the President and how many facts have been distorted in the process. ---  --- It also provides a rare look at what the President really does with his time and how much effort he puts into his work. ---  --- If you are looking for a book that labels President Bush as a liar or a dummy, this is not the book for you.  But it is a superb look at the events of the last year and a half, including the election of 2004. ---  --- Don't be narrow-minded.  I highly recommend it	pos
I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers.  It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed.  After trimming their claws you often get rough edges.  I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short.  They don't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet.  I must state that I will never again use this product for my own nails	neg
I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other "insane" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption. ---  --- Not this hot sauce.  It's perfectly hot enough, yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle.  I put it on everything:  Burger too blah with the normal condiments, El Yucateco can fix it!  Shrimp cocktail not kicking, El Yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss.  I even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat.   ---  --- It's definitely hot.  If all you're used to is normal, red-colored vinegar water, this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire.  But, if you're looking for something with good flavor that'll keep you coming back for more, this is the stuff. 	pos

I had no prior experience with music playing (other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica) and, yet, I found this --- book to be surprisingly easy to learn from.  It smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing, starting with one-hand playing, but quickly to two-hands, then chords, etc., and ending with sharp and flat notes.  It is well organized, has well thought out exercises, advices, and a diverse collection of (short) attractive tunes of increasing complexity (from Jingle Bells to Waltzing Matilda to Silent Night to Green Sleeves to We Shall Overcome to Minuet in G Minor).  I prefer it to other teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills, such as The Complete Piano Player or Piano for Dummies.  I particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing almost right away, which I feel is better preparation--even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially.  It may have helped (coordination-wise) that I have been typing for 20+ years with both hands.  If you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way, then I recommend this book. --- If you perfer a slower pace, then maybe look elsewhere. --- For me, this was the perfect book to learn from. 	pos
After hearing about this product and reading the reviews, decided to get one for our newborn baby.  The problem however, is that this does not cover the entire room even on its "high" setting.  Over the course of an hour, I would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room (12 x 12).  I put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting.  I've only had this product for a month so I will have to follow-up on durability.   ---  --- First month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room.  If it were a bit stronger, would give a better rating.  I feel like I will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner, or buy 3 of these (not practical)	neg
I love this smell- its sweet yet warm- not too sweet though, just right.  Very inviting, and you can wear with anything anywhere.  ALOT of compliments! with this one.... Will buy again! and again	pos
Be aware that the reviews for a book are displayed not only for one edition, but for all editions under the same title.  The Oxford Philosophical Texts edition of Hume's "Treatise" should be the standard student edition. The Prometheus Books edition is cheap, but it does not include a modern introduction or any study notes. I recommend the Oxford Philosophical Texts version if you want or need more than just the raw text	pos

Unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me. However it took quite some time before I could read anything about the era. Now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream I wonder if I should have kept up with this magazine.  ---  --- I now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area I was in. The major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information.  ---  --- Yet I have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them. ---  --- There is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in Vietnam in that time in history. ---  --- As with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history.  ---  --- Be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items. ---  --- 1/10 th Cavalry 1967-68 Armed Recon.	pos

I feel like an idiot, maybe I didn't have all the parts or something but I tried and my husband tried and my neice tried and my friend tried and my stepson tried and NONE of us could figure out how to get this thing together.   ---  --- Since there were no instructions, that helped alot.   ---  --- There was a picture but the hoops that went over secured to nothing and fell on the kid, making it utterly useless.  Though there were little things that appeared to attach to something, they taunted us and we tried and tried to attach this here and that there and maybe that will work...it was ridiculous.   ---  --- We haven't had the issue with any other baby thing...not car seats, not the red wagon, not the baby gates, not the crib or the cradle...but this thing after several attempts we just took the hangdowns off and she played with those until the batteries died.  We sold it at a garage sale for a buck and felt like glad for it to be out of our lives and out of our closet	neg
This game has a great design and excellent/fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC. Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues. This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly to the commands. The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat. This CAN be a fun game, just don't play the PC version. Borrow someone's Xbox and play that version. This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	neg
This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.

I have a hard time understanding what it is that I dislike about the novel. I dislike it almost as much as the movie. --- I have been a loyal follower of Smiley and some more after that. Once the Cold War was over, JlC had to look for a new realm. I tried to follow him, but gave up with the Kaukasian troubles, forgot the name of the book. --- Maybe it is this: JlC's trade mark, his USP, is the evilness of the other side. With the KGB & Co., that worked perfectly. His readers were willing to stay with him and believe him. --- Now he is transferring the KGB style to all sorts of other badies. I think it does not work any more. --- It is not that I trust the pharmaceutical companies enough to not be like here insinuated. I do not. --- What I do not like, I guess, is the artificial mood of intellectual suffering from the evilness of all kind of conspiracies. Tess in this story seems to be the normal do-gooder who falls foul with the baddies. That is more ok in the book than in the movie. (There, for my eyes, Rachel Weisz does herself discredit.) --- What is absolutely not ok is the surrender of command by the narrator mid way. JlC gives up on trying to keep a believable storyline and declines into darkest conspiracy allegations	neg
Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester. --- After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much. --- Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing	neg
This is a great book to have in your collection if you're a fan of blues music and history.  By far, it's not the ONLY book out there.  There are a  number of notable artists this book is missing.  Hopefully, future editions  of this book will begin to fill some of the gaps.  That being said, this is  a very good reference just the same	pos
I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	neg
I've been a subscriber for over fifteen years, and will probably continue to subscribe until the day I die. But at times I find National Geographic frustrating. I have no interest in Soccer, nor do I want a huge fold-out map discussing the sport. Aren't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today? Also, Geographic does have its pet topics.  ---  --- How many articles must we read about Pandas? A dozen? I like pandas, believe me, but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss. Also I could do without lectures and PC environmental propaganda. The articles about oil-drilling in Alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying. Yeah, we get it, you don't want Alaska drilled. Can we move on, please? ---  --- Other articles are quite interesting. I enjoy the zip code discussion, the old-fashioned pictures, and articles about countries. I could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though, and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring. ---  --- A friend of mine (a Joe Average type guy), said he stopped subscribing to Geographic because the articles were depressing him. I tried to argue with him, because I think the magazine is great- but I do kind of have to agree, the topics of late are downbeat and aren't particularly uplifting. I do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there' with its choice of topics, too.  ---  --- I recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them	pos

I have yet to see a PW review of anything that was not vetted by the PC Police, not to mention utterly stupid. When they want to pan a book, they apparently have a list of criticisms they pick from at random, such as "non sequitur" or "murky argument" or "reductionist". They pick them by throwing darts at the list and writing down whatever phrases the darts hit, in ways that prove that they don't actually have any understanding of what the terms mean. It's especially annoying because even when it's a book I like, I can easily see criticisms that someone with a different worldview could make that would be valid, but they don't make them; that would require work. ---  --- The reviews are so shoddy and wildly inaccurate that I thought about asking Amazon.com to stop using them for the product info pages, but then it occurred to me that any book PW pans is guaranteed to be good, so they are useful in a backwards way. Anytime PW praises a book, I don't bother with it, but if they attack it, I know it's going to be great	neg
Stiff Upper Lip is a good AC/DC album, it's not a great AC/DC album. ---  --- It kills me when people say that AC/DC have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done.  Nothing could be further from the truth. ---  --- I have always thought that each AC/DC album has a sound and a feel and a story in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album.  For instance, can you image Shake a Leg on Stiff Upper Lip?  Or Ballbreaker on Back in Black? ---  --- It doesn't work.  Stiff Upper Lip has its own kind of rough, bluesy feel to it.  Brian's voice sounds different, the tones and the guitars sound different.  It's good but not great.  The standouts... ---  --- 1. Stiff Upper Lip- Pretty rocking song.  Has a good attitude.  It's fun. ---  --- 2. Hold Me Back and Can't Stand Still.  Very odd rolling songs.  They sound a lot alike.  Again, these songs could NEVER have been on Back in Black.  I have heard that Brian sang Can't Stand Still in one take, that's why they all clap at the end.  I don't know if that's true, but it's an interesting song. ---  --- 3. Satellite Blues- This one is an instant classic.  I LOVE this song.  This song could have been done back in the days of Back in Black and if it were on that album I think it would be as popular as You Shook Me All Night Long. ---  --- Everything else is ho hum.  Not good, not bad.  Better than most bands out there.  I am really hoping AC/DC put out a killer album with their new release, whenever that is.  I hope they don't turn into the new G&R and suffer from the Chinese Democracy syndrome	pos
My new Shoe Wallet is even better than I expected!  It securely fastens to my running shoe; holds my key, emergency cash, and identification; and most importantly, serves as a safe place for my iPod Sport Sensor.

Goes on easy, and wipes off super, amazinglyl easy, and gives a very nice finish. --- I'll wait a few months to see how long it lasts, but the application was a pleasant experience. --- One thing - they said it doesn't get the black trim white, but it looks like it does - the white is starting to show about 2 weeks after I applied it.  It is possible that it is from my previous wax, but I don't think so since I covered that with Mother's Back-to-Black product.	pos
One of the most disastrous purchases we've ever made.  It works fine until you try to get the video images onto your computer.  Don't bother trying to consult the instruction guide; it's the worst one you've ever seen.  You could go to the website to attempt to download all the drivers that you supposedly need, but they're not actually on the website. ---  --- DEFINITELY find another brand	neg
Like 90% of the people who played this game, my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of 24. The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show.  ---  --- With the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show, it should not have been too hard to please me with this game. And in that respect, the game fulfilled, but did not exceed, my expectations.  ---  --- While I enjoyed watching this extra "day", the gameplay left a lot to be desired. There was quite a bit of variety, which was nice, and you get to play as almost every character from the show. There were so many different types of missions that the standard "get from point A to point B while shooting people" missions only made up about 60% of the game. The rest of the game involved driving, computer hacking, interrogating, sniping, and such. This would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun. Pretty much any mission involving driving sucked, since the controls were incredibly sloppy. Interrogation was kind of fun the first time, but it didn't need to be done several times. There were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again, so that they weren't much fun by the end of the game. As for the rest of the game, I'd describe it as mediocre. There wasn't anything spectacular about the gameplay; there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where I was going; and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter.  ---  --- In addition, there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult, in my opinion. In one such mission, you are playing as Jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb. There is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you, and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working. It wouldn't be nearly so annoying if it weren't for the fact that there doesn't seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission. I must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success. I have no idea what I did differently when I finally beat it. Pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying, because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover. And despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly, they never hit a single enemy, so you have to take everyone out yourself. ---  --- In all, the game is worth playing through for the story if you're a fan of the show. Otherwise, you could find much better action games out there	pos

"American Buffalo" was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic.  It is indeed raw, but not at all fantastic.

I wrote a review but I guess it was so bad for Ultramagnetic, Amazon booted it. The album is trash. Nothing at all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago. But don't take my word for it, sample for yourself. ---  --- Ahead of their time? Faith no more. What can I say about this album without my review getting kicked off Amazon again? I've used no profanity or content of explicit nature but this album highly does. 1988's CRITICAL BEATDOWN never, ever gave that kind of deliverance. That's why that's a classic and THE BEST KEPT SECRET is not, by any means (vocally, production, lyrically, concept). Can I get a witness? Please? ---  --- DJ MOE LUV is the only producer on the album trying to keep that old Ultramagnetic sound alive here on "Vibrato" and "Mechanism Nice (Born Twice)" the album's 1st single. CED-GEE kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging of 16 bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and obscene (never heard that on CRITICAL BEATDOWN by CED). KOOL KEITH does fine on solo track "Late Nite Rumble" but KOOL KEITH is goin' nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other songs, HIS delivery is sounding just like CED's towards the end of the album. T.R. LOVE? M.I.A. You see him in photos, you hear silence from him, he doesn't even produce a track. Production by CED, MOE and 2 others and the other 2 sound like KUTMASTA KURT producing (producer for most of KOOL KEITH solo stuff). I do not mean that in a good way. The beats of "Nottz" is bangin', the lyrics by both KEITH and CED should raise eyebrows on what's next to come for THE BEST KEPT SECRET being the B-side to the 1st single "Mechanism Nice (Born Twice)". ---  --- Songs like "Ain't It Good 2 U" (2007) and "Party Started" are for gentleman's clubs for the girls to dance to. Now do you see what direction this album is goin'? If you're lookin' for Ultramagnetic to comback with a reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and/or the masterful, brainiac, monkey wrench lyricism as CRITICAL BEATDOWN; FUNK YOUR HEAD UP and THE FOUR HORSEMEN albums gave you over a decade ago, you will not find it here. Maybe in the next 14 years. Right Ultramag	neg
I highly recommend this bundle for the price.  For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger, you get a travel charger, home charger and a USB cable with driver CD.  Everything works just fine.

My daughters are a little young for this toy and aren't that into it yet. It is very cute, with lots of sweet, tiny, realistic pieces, and I can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational. However, they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby. Well, my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off. Even if it hadn't broken, you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange. This is the least favorite barbie my girls own. If it weren't for the arms, this would be a great toy. Oh, and the back of the dresser is open, so you can't really store the small pieces in it. Not sure why they didn't just close it up to make storage easier.	neg
My son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly.  Talked about it for a month so we got it for him.  He was super excited when he got and and the thing didn't work.  It just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears. He was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it, then say he was no where near it.  Then when he was standing next to it, it said he was no where near it. He was so disappointed.  He thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him.  We followed the directs and helped him play with it.  He's 4. ( He wasn't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it doesn't work for some kids.) I think this is a terrible toy and Hayley's now in the trash.  She's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with	neg
Many people are having issues with the 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapters and Treos.

My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony (isolation) headphones work fine with this adapter.  ---  --- Maybe I'm just lucky, but for this low price, this adapter is fine. If you want sterling sound you shouldn't be listening to mp3 anyway. I can hear the limitations of my files on the treo, so it's clearly good enough	pos
Well, the labels did it again. First, when they released the album "Dream" on cd.

That being said, I love some of their other hits, especially "The way that I want to touch you." Luckily, the rest of the tracks are the originals. If you're looking for the original version of "You never done it like that", you would have to get the 20th Century Masters collection of theirs	neg

It doesn't download the complete trasaction details, reconcilliations are very difficult. --- You will be doing twice the work to use it. ---  --- Once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though Quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank, it didn't mark it internally, so on the next login, it sent the payment again!!! It has cost me $1509 of double payment that I am still trying to get back! ---  --- How you pay a bill is totally messed up, There is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection. (Bank's billpay can't be used!!) ---  --- It's very poor in organization, you can't have 2 accounts #'s with  a vendor (still in 2005!!!). --- It has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes, which have no real definition and no "default" use and stop every transaction. ---  --- One of the biggest thing Quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll. Technically you can do it yourself, but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should (must) buy the $299/year payroll service (old tax-tables). --- In all the documenation, not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how. --- Compared to the earlier products, this is a huge cost. By that reckoning I would have paid ~$2000 for the previous version of quickbooks!! ---  --- It's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be better  --- off. Don't waste money on Quicken services or premium products, they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum	neg
This DVD skips quite a bit, making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie.  Also, the plastic covering on the DVD casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off.  I've never had a movie do that before.  I would think twice in the future before buying movies from Amazon.com	neg
I've used this product with two of my children with out problems.  I have never had a leak unlike with some of the other brands.  Suggestions: Write the date on the bag before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use labels.  Also, never fill the bag!  It's only meant to hold 6 oz.   ---  --- These bags are much thicker than the Gerber bags and they are the only ones to have the double zipper. I used these liners with my Avent Disposable system and standard bottles.  ---  --- I've gone through over 600 of these bags and I must say Amazon has the best price around	pos
So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not	neg
Let me first say I am one of Martha Stewart's biggest fans! I have enjoyed MSL magazine for years and loved the format of the "old" show (the new one is taking awhile to get used to). I jumped at Body and Soul when it first came out, but have been repeatedly disappointed in the obvious exclusion of anything "male" in the articles.  Not to mention, the articles on relationships and love have NEVER mentioned same sex partners which I find totally unacceptable, unforgivable, and just plain stupid from a marketing standpoint.  Why exclude men and gay people?  I have also noticed there are no ads from advertisers marketing to men either. Most if not all of the articles are nothing more than "new age" pablum, either "borrowed" or stolen from much better magazines such as Alternative Medicine.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  This isn't even good enough to line my cat's litter box	neg

 This spring is of industrial strength. It can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs. Better than any made available at your local hardware store. It's only about 4 in. long so it does not take up much space.

It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived. ---  --- The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes. ---  --- Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost. 	neg

I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingerie store lady), but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the "Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the "Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra," which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.). ---  --- So, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in. ---  --- This bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bra, too. Good Luck	pos
My 3 year old got this for a Christmas gift, and I thought it to be a great idea, since he loves Elmo and bathtime.  WRONG...  the darn crayons stained my bathtub!!

My son likes the Elmo still, but I wouldn't recommend the crayons, especially in an older-style porcelain bathtub, like ours	neg

i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume!  --- like all the LUSH bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong STRONG smell.  --- i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore. --- so yeah, if you love love LOOOOOOOOVE patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one. --- i love LUSH, but not this bar	neg

I remember when this ran on ESPN2 during the week between Christmas & New Year's back in 2000. I'm a huge fan of the microgenre of football movies...but this one stays at the bottom of the barrel.  ---  --- Pettine Sr. seems like a class act & worthy of the respect "local legend" high school football coaches deserve. His son, Pettine Jr, coaches at the rival school but lacks the charisma to make this documentary work.  Maybe the footage of him not seeming like a dolt didn't record right & thus we have no reason to root for him or his program at the finale. Rather than having a bittersweet moment at the ending after the dad plays the head-to-head season finale against the son, Pettine Jr seems kinda clueless giving the old guy a half-hearted handshake.  So much for paternal respect & love. ---  --- Had the potential to be great w/the setup. But don't let the glowing summary trick you...there's no emotional payoff to speak of for "The Last Game."  Football, after all, has driven grown men to tears on numerous occassions. Your time would be better spent watching Brian's Song, Rudy or the NBC series "Friday Night Lights." Even reruns of MTV's "Two-a-days" about Hoover of Alabama would be superior if you prefer the doc/reality TV style	neg

I was never a diehard Huey Lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll. If you're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection, this one is worth the price of admission. I'm not familiar with all the original members so just having Huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as I remembered them, it was memorable, high-energy performance. One little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me. About halfway through the show, Huey's shirt had a meltdown. All of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour. Am I the only one that noticed this? But it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had. Who could ask for more	pos

To start - I miss my hair. Last september I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January - and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it that length. (I've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - I couldn't get it out via any other method tried except "growing out"). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get. --- My last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck length  - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut, and then layered. That got rid of the really saturated henna'd hair - so I was ready to start growing it out. After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad. I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them. Last night - maybe it was wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day. He knows I've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color. Last night he looked at me and said "Hey wow - you're hair's really grown - I can see a half inch more of the roots! Wow - you're hair is getting dark!" --- I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins! I can't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks, come August - if I have another 1/2 inch to add to it, I will definitely be reordering these pills! --- But a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day. I find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well.	pos

We learned about agave nectar in San Francisco at Tres Agaves, a Mexican restaurant that makes the best margaritas we have ever had.  They use 100% reposado blue agave tequila with lime juice and with agave nectar to take the bite off.

I love the History Channel, have infinite respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years in the part of China where Flying Tigers is set.  So, you'd think I might adore this film?  I had hoped so, but unfortunately Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap. ---  --- John Wayne plays a fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton.  He does his best to carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone.  Bad effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all plague TIGERS. ---  --- Republic made little effort to hide the California filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES!  There is little mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were accurate. ---  --- The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that does them little service	neg

This product is a huge waste of time.  It loaded easily enough, looks friendly, and is feature rich but it just doesn't work !  And support is awful.  Biggest problem is it just would make a good back up image.  Burned many dvd's and the program kept telling me the files were corrupted.  In most cases, I couln't even get confirmation of that.  The program did something to my DVD drive.  It would ask me to swap a spanned set, yet disable my drive !  Process had to be cancelled, whole system rebooted just to get access to my dvd drive again.  When I tried manually checking the files they wouldn't open.  Explore or mounting the images kept requiring a "password".  But I don't use passwords !  Made sure the settings were all password free.   --- Stick with Norton Ghost !!!!!	neg

Great features on this watch.  I especially like the linked timers and the three alarms.  My wrist is tiny, and the selection of holes is great (I use the tightest).

"Modern" usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch.  It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop.  The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are  basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics  and great hooks.  I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch  Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy "Operator's Manual" or  "Going Steady."  Or dig up the amazing "Different Kind of  Tension" from a used record store somewhere!  Also, see them live if  you have a chance	neg

When you decide to adapt a classic film you should take warning several aspects: Has the story aged? How has the suspense's concept altered for the new audiences?   --- We know about the professed sympathy of Cimino for Rourke. We saw him in The year of the Dragon. And somehow Mickey doesn't look credible as the distorted mind criminal. He is too rational and cold to represent that hard character. The illumination is another serious problem. The whole drama looks extremely theatrical: Anthony Hopkins looks uncomfortable with the role and Mimi Rogers is inexpressive. Elias Koteas is simply out of context and perhaps that's why the insipid dialogue. Maybe David Morse shows certain wild tendency. There is a rigidity in the dialogue. Obviously you assist to the common places: the internal disagreements in the policy procedure. Lindsay Cruise is assertive in this role. But the initial sequence of the getaway is terrific. It looks too artificial and the viewer' adrenaline simply is not emanated. The sumptuous photography saves the film of the collapse. The music didn't help to maintain the suspense. It is not easy to readapt a classic film of the fifties. Something similar happened with Cape fear `s remake. --- The question might be around the new approach of the suspense and the new technologies. Bogart looked extremely old for the role and Rourke looked too elegant to be a convincing ex con.  --- Good entertainment for teenagers in a pop corn rainy weekend.         	neg

I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then.  I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year.  I pump once a day, so they get used, but not abused.  The model has changed some, I think it is more powerful this time.  The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield.  My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option.  I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap.  I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.  I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it's still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off.  I still very much like this product as it gets the job done	pos

"The Great Director," Volume 2 in the "Unknown Chaplin" series from Thames Television, looks at Chaplin working on some of his biggest films, including "The Kid," "The Gold Rush" and my personal favorite, "City Lights."   The chief assets of this documentary are the treasures found in the Chaplin family private film vault, including discarded sequences and home movies never before seen by the public.  There are also interviews with Jackie Coogan, Lita Grey, Virginia Cherrill and others who worked with Chaplin.  The emphasis remains on how Chaplin worked, beginning with simple sight gags and slapstick and transforming them into comic masterpieces.  This volume also gets into a bit more of Chaplin's artistic temperament, especially when his patience ran thin with Cherrill and he temporarily replaced her with Grey as the blind girl in "City Lights."  There are even clips of the film's classic ending shot with Grey.  Kevin Brownlow and David Gill were given access to these unseen films by Oona Chaplin and they make the most of it in providing a portrait of a great artist at work.  James Mason provides the narration, managing to sound like a college professor lecturing students and at the same time like a fan of Chaplin's comic genius.  Whether you have seen a few or all of Chaplin's films, "Unknown Chaplin" is an absolute treat	pos

I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more	pos
A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. The red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem	pos
I have always carried a soft spot in my hear for shiny metallic eye shadows and metallic browns, chocolates, coppers and vanilla such as in this quad for look fantastic on pretty much any complexion. Each prismatic color cube is in it's own tiny little clear box with a tiny lid on, those I discard and simply keep the top four squares open unless I out the entire top lid on once I'm done doing my makeup. ---  --- I love to sweep the palest shimmery vanilla on the entire brow bone and my whole lid, I usually wear black liquid liner right under the lash line and right on top, creating a black back drop that make applying any eye makeup on top easy and gives it great depth. Then I use the darkest color with a short brush I cut on an angle to blend the dark color on top of the liner for a smoky and glowing effect. The other two colors I layer on top in between the vanilla base and the dark smoke, but I don't feel the need to use all four colors at the same time. I also wet the brush sometimes, Visine is good for making liquid liner type of a finish when used on a brush and then dipped in some shadow. ---  --- The colors have deep intensity to them and they sparkle like melting precious metals in the sun. Wonderful for any makeup novice or artist for their ease of use and the dramatic and breath taking effect they so easily produce. ---  --- - Kasia S.	pos

I first encountered Moleskine notebooks in a bookstore in London this spring, and what lodged in my memory was their marketing claim to be "the legendary notebook of Hemingway," et cetera. I have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. But now that I own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it, I'm beginning to see, at least, why Moleskine notebooks have so many fans. ---  --- For more than ten years, I've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. I never bought into that aspect of the company, but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers, and with a place for a pen besides. Going from that to a Moleskine, with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument, is definitely a switch. It's the part of the change I'm least sure about. On the other hand, the Moleskine definitely wins for portability, ease of use, style, and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms. ---  --- So I'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. But it's definitely a good one, and I do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. Sure, you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price, and a whole "lifestyle system," updated annually, for quite a bit more. It's all a matter of taste, and my taste is starting to run in this direction	pos

My Coolpix 8800 lapsed into "system error 2" mode within weeks of getting it.   After taking 3 or 4 shots the error message comes up and I have to shut it down and start it back up to take a few more shots before the error 2 message recurrs.  Nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card...no help.   Now Nikon says says send it in and we'll fix it- but don't say what it will cost...   The shots I do get aren't as good as an HP camera we have that was half the price.  The controls are ridiculously complex.   The flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light...the whole thing is a piece of junk.  The only good shots I've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away...but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable... I wouldn't recommend this camera or any Nikon product to my worst enemy....Oh yeah, and they made the lens an oddball size so you have to buy overpriced Nikon filters for it....	neg
This is an excellent movie for the romantic type. A real classic!  Got it for my wife for her birthday.  Enjoyed it very much	pos
I enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera.  My Minolta Dimage X (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life, having been around for about 5 years.  The Minolta had a 3/4" screen on the back.  (this one has a 2.5" screen- great colors) ---  --- The best feature I liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens.  I don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty.  Therefore, I was excited that this camera had an internal zoom. ---  --- Tonight I was at a Bulls game, in the 300 section (nose bleed), and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of Kirk Hinrich.  The 3x optical zoom is incredible, but more so incredible is the digital zoom.  I was also able to zoom into the jumbotron, and it looked as crisp as if I was taking the photo directly.  ---  --- Action shots are GREAT. Low light shots are GREAT!   ---  --- It is exactly what I was looking for 	pos
Great movie and musical numbers courtesy of Quincy Jones and the wonderful cast.	pos
I regret buying this gun. It broke within four days of buying it. We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up(for accuracy), and it fired great. It was really accurate. The gun was made of really cheap plastic, and the trigger stopped working. Right now, we're waiting for a RMA on it. I would recommend paying a little extra, to buy a more durable gun. I bought another gun that cost $55, and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable	neg
This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful, positive, entrancing, funny, inventive, has a great soundtrack, and doesn't involve violence / carnage.  I'm 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks.  My 6 year old son was equally engaged, and was able to complete about 40% of it without help, himself (he needed help with boss battles, or anything under time pressure). ---  --- You can lose hours to this game but you won't emerge with tense, sore shoulders from anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks.  At the same time, it is definately not too easy.  It's just challenging enough.  And it's long thank goodness, because I didn't want it to end!  The overall tone is so positive.  You get to be a Japanese wolf goddess romping through what is a detailed, beautifully imagined and executed Japanese watercolor world.  You have weapons and you do take out monsters, but your weapon is a ink brush, and you take out the monsters with calligraphy strokes.   ---  --- Simply brilliant, and would make an excellent Christmas gift for an adventure game lover	pos
-- Update 4/23/2007 - The vendor indicates a new firmware release is due in the 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame, and it may fix the issue of the limited number of pictures mentioned below. -- ---  --- Picture quality is fair and adjusting brightness and contrast in the setup yields good results. Appearance of the unit is good and the black and cherry frames are nicely finished, but the red rectangular sensor for the remote below the LCD display mars the effect somewhat. ---  --- At 5.6 inches, this size frame is only useful where it can be viewed up close. The images are smaller than a 4x6 print that you would typically view in a book or hold in your hand. I found putting it on a book shelf to be too far away. On an end table next to the chair you would view it from is better. The size of the LCD also should tell you that resolution is not spectacular, true of any frame in this category.  ---  --- My biggest problem with this particular unit is that even after updating to the latest firmware (~3/2007), it will only display up to about 250 pictures. I expected that what ever was on the memory card I inserted would be displayed. ---  --- Overall this is still a good buy if you do not want to display a large number of photos.  I am very disappointed that the number of displayable pictures is not listed in the manufacturer's product description so you know of the limit before you purchase it	neg

At church today I came upon a man who had partially collapsed.  Since I'm a physician, I stopped and offered aid.  It turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was having some pretty concerning symptoms.  To my dismay, we do not have an AED at our church (yet).  We notified 911, and he was taken for medical care without any problems, but I was a bit worried there for a few minutes.  While I'm trained in BLS, that is, at best, a temporizing measure.  AEDs have a proven ability to diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms.  In my opinion, places of public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices.  I'll be working with our church to see if we can get one.  I would have been a bit more relaxed waiting for EMS if I had had one of these today. ---  --- However, buying an AED is not a cure-all.  I have been trained on these, and they are very simple to learn to use.  However, I think it would be quite difficult for someone who had never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac arrest.  If you are considering buying an AED for home or public use, I strongly suggest reading the section on AEDs at the American Heart Association website.  It discusses some of the important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a device. ---  --- So, while not for everyone, this is one of the few products available that can truly save lives.  In the right situation, it is indispensable.	pos

I bought the WMR968 2/10/2005 and as of today,2/14/2007, only the indoor Baro-Therm-hygro still works. The Anemometer was replaced under warrenty 11/2005. This service took 2 months to complete with Oregon Sci. The anemometer then quit 12/2006 and Oregon Sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. The Thermo-Hygro quit 2/2007 and once again, tough luck. ---  ---  My thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: Cheap and cheaper. The manual is nearly worthless. The anemometer is accurate to about 60 Kts. then gets wildly optimistic. The temp.,humidity, baro seem accurate. The rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. All of the failures I have had I think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. Everone has had green corrosion on the PC boards when taken down from the rooftop. The sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap.  ---  ---  I just got off the phone, again, with Oregon Sci. and Juan from customer Service told me "we can't help you".  ---  ---  If you want a weather station that is made cheaply, has no customer support and will last less then 2 years buy a WMR968. I guess for the price compared to professional weather stations this thing will attarct a lot of people but buyer beware	neg
Most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning Srdjan Dragojevic film at select film festivals in the U.S. have not forgotten its clarity, its anger, and its power.  The movie was passed up for theatrical distribution, although it was readily available on VHS and now on DVD from Fox Lorber. ---  --- This DVD is a bust in every thinkable way, although Fox Lorber was obviously aiming very low.  The phrase "bare-bones" is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary, dismissive releases, lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant.  This DVD does contain a trailer, but the trailer, sadly, looks better than the feature.  "Bare-bones" would have been fine, but watching this disc is torture. ---  --- It's obviously a quickie transfer from the VHS -- I could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout, poor audio balance (with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo) poor contrast, a muddy, dark image, burnt-in subtitles, and so forth.  Fox Lorber were long the scourge of the art-film DVD market, and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc.  New Yorker and Wellspring (formerly Winstar) are guilty of similar offenses	neg
After watching this video I examined the Bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy.

Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers).  Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are.  Most amazing to me was that they  held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously.  The movies, of course, are not serious.  I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these.  The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable.	pos
I used my last little smokey at least 3 days a week 6 mounths of the year here in MN for 18 years. I am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a Webber but you use verry little charcoal. Don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking, this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. Getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. As far as preformance goes you can't beat a Webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot), or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. Read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. The only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic.	pos
I expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called "batteries."  Number one, I was disappointed to find out, after some scientific analyses I performed on them, that duracell's world famous  "copper top" statement is erroneous. This so called "copper  top" is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called  copposyclamatrane. I can't top the copper top? hardly.     After the  analyses, I put these "copper top" batteries to the test.  What I  did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like  sheen.  What I got was far from.  A tiny light that could only be  classified as much less than miniscule.  I threw the flashlight at my cat  in disgust, expecting hilarious results, and I wasn't disapointed!  This  was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision I've  ever made.  Thanks for nothing, dura-hell	neg
Wow, this l932 camp classic squeezes so much into its running time--S&M, near-nudity, drugs, racism,sex, sex--you're left gasping. Boris Karloff turns in a delightful turn as the menacing Fu Manchu. Myrna  Loy, in her pre-superstar days, is his "horribly ugly" daughter,  who delights in capturing gorgeous hunk, Charles Starrett, and playing with  him like a toy. His nearly nude scenes--when he wears a loose, constantly  shifting diaper--while she runs her long talons over her glistening  torso--must've have accelerated pulses of all sexes back in this pre-Code  extravaganza. Fay Wray should have played Karen Morley's squealing heroine.  Silver-haired and elegant Lewis Stone makes an off-beat hero-adventurer.  Gorgeous photography by Tony Gaudio, comic book costumes by Adrian, art  deco settings by Cedric Gibbons make this a smash-hit from the first frame  to the last. Lots of flesh baring by Charles and the dark slaves. It's fun  to watch Myrna lash her whip over Starrett and her "Nubian"  slaves. Great quote: "Will we ever understand this Eastern race?&quot	pos
I was looking for the Black and White Deluxe Version (with expansion pack) and came across this. I was a little hesitant in purchasing it because one of the reviews (by Computer Dude) said none of the games have activation numbers. Let me start by saying that this is not true. This is a little four page installation manual that tells how to install all four games (really five including the Black and White expansion pack) and on the back were all five activation numbers. I installed Black and White without any problems and was up half the night playing it. The only difference between these games and the originals is that all the documentation (manuals etc.) except for the four page installation guide, are on the game CDs. So if you are looking for a couple of these games this is a great deal and the information by computer dude claiming that their are no activation numbers was inaccurate	pos
Before buying DDR, I read everyone's reviews, and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it.

Well, it's not really 50 different songs.  About 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track. --- ~The graphics are horrible...a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are. ---  --- I wouldn't reccommend buying this...at all	neg

I bought one of these for my Canon SD-800 and can recommend it.  For many years now, I've carried Canon pocket cameras on my belt while traveling and the Canon-branded cases are simply the best for this purpose.  My only criticism of the Canon cases has been their lack of a small pocket for media.  I was hoping that with the tiny size of SD cards Canon would have added such a pocket to their newer cases, but they haven't.  On the plus side, the case retains the superior leather construction, uses a neat magnetic tie down for the flap instead of Velcro or a snap, and has a belt loop that is tight enough to hold the camera comfortably against your body.  The package also includes a nice looking leather replacement strap for your camera.  Incidentally, the SD-800 is well matched to the case, fitting quite securely	pos

This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.	pos

We use our videocameras to tape preschool classrooms for observations.  The hope was to use the microphone to isolate conversations. --- To test the microphone.  I went to a Noisy Starbucks, huge lines, moderate music and tons of conversations.  I recorded on the video cameras mics, then used the zoom mic then used the gun feature.  I aimed the microphone at the barista yelling out the coffee orders.  In all instances, there was no difference in sound quality.   --- I then went to the Sony Style Store in the Mall and had her open a different Microphone and allowed her to install it. She read the package from a distance and then we listened to it in all three settings.  We could not find any difference.   --- I checked the camera instructions and there was no setting for the external mic.  Once the mic is attached and turned on, the external mic is suppose to override the on board mic.   ---  --- I am still insearch for a gun mic for a digital camera.  Many of the new camcorders with hard drives and DVD drives do not have a MIC input or Active Interface Shoe.  I would rather want a MIC input so that I can use a more powerful mic rather than being at the mercy of Sony to create one for their shoe.   ---  --- Overall, I am stuck.  If I record something interesting I will probably have to try to enhance the audio portion while editing.  (The camera shots great video	neg

Yes, it is messy...it's a giant bubble wand...when was the last time you played bubbles that there wasn't a mess?  But if you keep it out doors, I don't see the problem.  My son was able to make bubbles right away (something he wasn't able to do with smaller wands since he can't seem to blow (he sucks air in instead of out).

There are several real advantages to using Quicken Willmaker software.  ---  --- 1. The legal part of the software was done by Nolo. They publish an awful lot of do-it-yourself software, and are well respected (if you are not a lawyer). Nolos involvement helps to assure me of a quality product.  ---  --- 2. The user interface, a fill in the blank approach with a lot of help screens, make the whole process quite easy and painless to go through.  ---  --- 3. Besides the standard last will, the package includes a number of other documents that you may want decide you need. Among others this includes Living Trust, Living Will, Final Arrangements, Notice to Terminate Joint Credit Card Accounts, Child Care Agreement & instructions, and many more.  ---  --- Having said that, there are two problems with the software:  ---  --- 1. If you live in Louisiana, your laws are based on the French system, not the English system and there is a caution on the box that says: 'Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana.'  ---  --- 2. There has been at least one law suit saying that if you fill out the will for another person, you may be practicing law without a license. Do a Google search on 'Heirs sue over will-making software' where someone apparently used this software to do a will for a lady.	pos
After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them. ---  --- 1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal. --- 2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak. --- 3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. --- 4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod	pos

Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping. ---  --- The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good. ---  --- We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land. ---  --- Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!	pos
I was really pleased with the quality of this patio table.  It was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering.  As others have commented, the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table I ordered.  I had to buy additional screws at Home Depot, four in total.  The missing instructions, for the table ordered, were not really needed, it was simple enough to put together without instructions.  All tools needed were included with the shipment.  Had I not needed to purchase additional screws, I would have given this product 5 STARS	pos
As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful. ---  --- Ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your PS2 to your compatible tv/receiver. These cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable. Therefore, you'll have to forget using the single plug-in the PS2 offers for both audio and video. However, your sound will be uncompressed, fully digital audio. This is definitely a plus, rather than a negative. Any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input	pos

Please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature. Read this book yourself before giving it to your child. It discusses oral sex, anal sex, how to use and purchase condoms, masturbation (for girls and boys), etc. When the author discusses Exploring Your Own Sexuality, she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth, as she would have stopped sucking her thumb. The cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within. It is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve. For many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate	neg
Columbia sport sandals for kids are great! We've bought them three years in a row now for our kids. ---  --- They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.

This is a great "linguisa"!  I usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have 'HOT' Chorizo Sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not 'hot'.

And the price is good too.  Free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy.  I highly recommend it	pos
These dominos are great for the hello kitty lover.  My six year old loves them.  Don't be fooled by the picture though, the tin is not full.  If you ask me, there are not enough of them in there.

I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope. ---  --- This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.   ---  --- The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks! ---  --- The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful. ---  --- I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects. ---  --- Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored. ---  --- NOT recommended	neg

MechAssault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to  destroy everything in his path, and school armys with one huge battle machine. Destroying other Mechs and tanks as well. But when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs, then you would throw it aside not play it again? No. Not if you have Xbox Live. In Live you can play Capture The Flag, download new Mechs, and play with hundreds of players just like you, and you will always come back for more. If you don't have Xbox Live or a system link, that your wasting your money.    	pos

George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys. ---  --- This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package --- wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be. ---  --- However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then. ---  ---  --- In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did. ---  --- By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way --- better than the main feature.	neg

I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed! ---  --- If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it	neg
I enjoyed this book having read other non-fiction frontier books. However, I must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools/objects, etc., I could have done without. I would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker, because such descriptions were so detailed.  If you're a technical/hands-on person, then you probably would like knowing how items/tools were built from raw materials in the frontier. But for me, I was more interested in the story, than the instructionals.	pos
We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!   ---  --- Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars. ---  --- Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.   ---  --- Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor	neg

Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. --- Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  --- On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around. ---  --- If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job. ---  --- Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately	neg
This has got to be the BEST adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen. And Samantha Morton is the reason. She is positively delightful in the title role. She has grace and beauty just perfect for the roll. One of her lines of dialogue is incorrect. She says "I am not a beauty, I am Jane Eyre". Truthfully speaking, she IS a beauty! The story flows smoothly. It's not too long nor too short. My favorite used to be the Orson Wells, Joan Fontaine version. But after seeing this British version, I had to change.

Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake).	neg

This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY!  My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it.  After all, it IS a ball!  We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors!  We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time.  So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time. ---  --- I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work.  It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use.  She never played with this toy as a crawling infant.  She only plays with it now, and she only throws it.  Please don't waste your money on this toy.  It's not worth it	neg

I love granola and cereal in general, but I have to say that this is the very best granola I have ever had. The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: "we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce." Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste. ---  --- Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.  ---  --- The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy. ---  --- Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly	pos

This book is pitched, at least in part, to Linux beginners. But it fails in small, maddening ways when speaking to this audience. After a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install, page 65 tells you to run the "man" command in a shell session. It offers no clue that the only way to terminate a "man" command is the letter Q - a completely unintuitive action. So a new user can flounder forever, or at least until they get frustrated and reboot. But I don't mean to slam just this book. That same problem exists in most other beginning Linux books, even O'Reilly's pocket guide. All these knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow magically gain access to information that the authors have in their heads, but haven't committed to paper.  ---  --- Except for that, it's a very good book.	pos
There are some amazing moments on this record.  I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row, and waiting for the fourth song to end.

We had better luck than some - the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out. Called customer service, and they said it isn't a replaceable part. Too bad. It was easy enough to install, and worked well up until it didn't anymore. The click is pretty loud; we found ourselves trying to close it two-handed to avoid waking up the baby. Disappointed it didn't last as long as we needed a gate - but my daughter is only 2 1/2 and I still need a gate at the top of the stairs. I'l be replacing it with a different product, obviously	neg

My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother.  He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets.  Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart.  NOTE:  he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys.  But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play.   ---   ---  --- After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it.  We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale.  I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money.

I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product.  They say it "transforms" into the batmobile - that is a joke!  You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that "feature" in the first place?  The whole thing is made terribly.  It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks.  None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it.  Bottom line:  this was a complete waste of money	neg

We first had the original diaper champ, which I would have given 4 stars.  It kept the odor in pretty well, was easy to use, used regular trash bags...etc.  We really liked it until one day a velcro tab on a diaper pulled the foam out of the lid.  Since it was letting the odor out, we decided to replace it with the new and improved model.  WORST DIAPER PAIL EVER.  As soon as the diapers start piling up, the lid grabs tabs, wipes, etc and jams the top so you can't flip it.  I spent so much time shaking, wiggling and kicking the thing I was very quickly exasperated. When you flip the top, it created much bigger gaps on the two sides than the older model.  This is why things get jammed...also why it lets a huge waft of diaper odor out every time you flip it.  HORRIBLE	neg
I ordered this through Walmart.Com and received it damaged, but Walmart and/or Storkcraft use a distributor called SEKO Worldwide.  The Seko delivery truck delivered the crib. So either this is a Storkcraft problem or a SEKO problem, but the head board had a piece completely split off in two and the other pieces were dented or chipped off. Walmart is re-odering another crib and having this one picked up for me as it is an 80-pound box.  Hopefully the next crib won't be damaged, but if so, I am giving up on Storkcraft completely. Walmart didn't have a rating system to leave comments, and when I saw others on this website that had damage problems, I wanted to relay my experience as well.  Walmart graciously refunded my shipping fee, which was large.  I then received the second crib and it was spotless.  The delivery man from Seko Worldwide said that they hear complaints on this a lot and blamed the air carrier that flies the boxes out to the ground shipping location. I also emailed Storkcraft about what happen and the other negative reviews, they offered to send a replacement piece for the broken piece (but no mention about the dented/chipped piece) and then proceeded to place the blame on the retailer.  I was not impressed.  ---  --- I was willing to take my chances on the reorder and was one of the fortunate customers who recieved an unmarked crib.  I put it together myself, all the parts were accounted for and the drawer works great.  I only bought this for the price and the convertable feature but will not buy Storkcraft in the future.  	neg

I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I've just finished the first workout.  There are some familiar moves from the original TAE-BO tapes, but these exercises are much more challenging.  The 'Billy Bands' add resistance to the basic moves.  This allows you to get a strength, cardio and flexibility workout in one.   The choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step.  This is a very challenging workout, and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape.  If you are moderately fit, you'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating. According to my heart rate monitor, this workout burned a little less than 700 calories, so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors.	pos

As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer.  I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years.  After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed.  It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch. ---  --- Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either.

T. Dorau -- when properly stored, what you complain about will never happen.  A battery should -never- be stored in sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures.

The inclusion of the LED light source is very thoughtful on the part of the designer(s). ---  --- In addition to jump starting a car, this is a good choice for small household items (TV, Radio, Weather Alert Radio) or emergency communications equipment (CB, Ham Radio). ---  --- This product also appears in some stores under the "Husky" and "Vector" brand-names	pos

For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc.  The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above.  Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV	pos
The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long. I tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn't last. This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks.	neg
My girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday. He won't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on. We can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it. The main reason he quit listening is because after I spent time trying to set the station in the morning, during his shower the station would automatically change to another one, give me a break! This is a worthless radio, it doesn't even deserve 1 star	neg

Bailie draws on Rene Girard's theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force, and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence.  I found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory.  Bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory, producing a hard-hitting indictment of all forms of violence, whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act.  Increasingly, I find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice.  I have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading Violence Unveiled, nor do I react to photojournalism with my previous detachment.  The impact stays with me, despite the fact that I read the work initially two years ago when I borrowed it from a friend.  I now have my own copy, heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by Bailie's excellent analyses.  Provocative and insightful	pos
Casino Player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler (and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps!).  It is one of the pricier magazines, but the cost is well worth it, and it isn't over-run with advertising.   ---  --- The letters to the editor touch on basic gaming, slot, and comp questions, and I always glean useful information from the Q&A section.  The magazine content covers slot machines, video poker strategy and probability, table game strategy and expected pay-offs, investing in the gaming industry's publicly-held corporations, and reviews of properties, restaurants, and shows.  I always read it before heading to Vegas to learn what is new and happening on the Strip and in the area. ---  --- Casino Player provides balanced coverage of Vegas, Atlantic City, Indian properties, and riverboat casinos.  As a Southern CA native, I usually skim features outside Vegas, but the magazine should be commended for reaching out to gamblers in all parts of the country	pos

My son received this toy as a present from his father on Christmas (Dec '05) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box.  I bought my son the V Smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system.  While a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right.  While with the V smile system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system.  I have  only one complaint and that is  I wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters.  My son loves Thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could I think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages.  But all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.	pos
Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".

I've seen this in retail stores for 25% more, but never got around to buying one. I stumbled over it on Amazon, and couldn't beat the price.  ---  --- I cook a lot of salmon on my Weber Genesis, and have always had a difficult time keeping pieces of fish from sticking to the grill with my regular flipper. ---  --- This product solved my problem. It's the perfect size for a 1lb. filet, and the edge is tapered just enough that you can get under the fish without cutting in to it. No more jabbing at the fish to keep it intact, and no more balancing.  ---  --- Think about it... this is just a fish turner. And it's so good, someone's taking the time to review it.	pos
I eat pretty healthy and I'm always looking for new healthy snacks, especially sweet ones!! But this purchase was a real disappointment. The quality and quantity were fine, but the taste was totally lacking. If you've ever had "Dr. Fuhrman's Date Nut Pop'ems" this product is nothing like those. I would say the primary taste is "ground flax seed", not a bad taste, kind of mild, but certainly doesn't satisfy a sweet tooth	neg

We got this before our little one was born. She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs. We used it in her bedside bassinet, and later in her crib. Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib, they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours. Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it. She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one. Comparible in price to other nursery monitors, you get so much more. It also has clear sound and little interference in our house	pos

I got one of these to help me after I had major surgery.  I have better than average hand and arm strength, but I found this particular model to be hard to operate (I can't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it).  Normal sized cans (like soup or beans) slipped out of its pitiful grip.  I wound up using it just to roll things to myself when I dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash.  This is definitely a lightweight... too light for much real use.  I should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more	neg

I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn.  It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other "gourmet" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars.  Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known.  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better.  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.   ---  --- As a treat, I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger, sprinkle a little of this on it, and then pretend like I'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter, but without the lime.  Almost like a couple of hours on the beach. ---  --- I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don't get enough iodine.  This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood, but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties	pos
This Lady Grey loose tea is a sensory experience. It is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine.

I was very pleased with this charger. I was considering a portable charger but was advised that it may not work if the battery is too low. My van would not start after some cold weather and my battery was so low that the interior lights were out. After reading info about other chargers I decided on this one.  I read the directions connected it and it did the job. I called Black and Decker and they were very helpful with any questions I had. This is a small price to pay for the convenience, certainly better then having to call a tow truck. It's portable and lightweight, stores easy.I never charged a battery in my life and I was able to do it	pos
 --- I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February.  I am returning it and this is why: ---  --- The package arrived from Amazon.  I loaded up the software on my computer, then hooked up the player through the usb cord.  I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state.   Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player.  So after the music was loaded, I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music.  The sound quality was good, the player is easy to navigate in the menus, etc...  The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player.  I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there.  So I plugged the player back into the usb cord, and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer.  The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player.  I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there.  Then I accessed through the computer just fine.   ---  --- All my songs, all 4,500 of them, are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd's.  The player just wouldn't read about half my songs.  There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize.  I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks.  This happened with my entire music collection.   ---  --- So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update.  It did not solve the problem.  I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine.  I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service.  It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why.  They have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company I have ever spoke with.  After three calls, never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language, more like a 3rd or 4th language, I arrived nowhere.  They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem.  No email ever came, checked the junk folder and every other possible place.  So I tried a fourth call.  This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand, saying "I can't believe you Americans" and then mumbled something in another language.   I asked for a supervisor. He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days.  Then he hung up.   ---  --- I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature.  They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way.  So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again.  ---  --- By the way, after all this, the problem never was fixed.   ---  --- Also, when doing research on this product, I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files.  This is not true.  This player will not play any files without being converted first.  I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file.  The format they use is absolutely a waste of space.  If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format, it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more.  I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie.  I was wrong, the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted. ---  --- I would not recommend this product to anyone.  As much as I don't like the IPod, I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because:  1. It plays all my music 2.  They have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers. ---  --- I hope this helps anyone looking at this player. ---  --- Jeff	neg
I'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color....I would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil, this is a perfect neutral color.I subtracted one star because i --- prefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush. I think it looks more natural..  Brenda Christian makes a brow powder which I prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powder --- I can find.  Sometimes I mix the two. I start with the pencil and add a bit of powder.  All all, it's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils	pos
We bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. It resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears, but nobody thinks will happen to them. Attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find. ---  --- Expecting our first child in less than three weeks, we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament, especially with years of other irreplaceable photos, financial data and other documents on our laptop. Now we're doing weekly, monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. Even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen, it's better than what we used to do -- which, though thankfully uneventful, was absolutely nothing. ---  --- If that's not enough to make you want to buy this, then the Sony name, quality, reliability and ease of use should be. The drive is small, stylish, easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. Although it's a little loud when the drive is working, it reads and writes CD-R media up to 48x, Ultra Speed Plus CD-RW up to 32x, DVD+/-R up to 16x, and High Speed DVD+RW up to 8x. After a lengthy initial full backup using the included Nero BackItUp software (about 8 GB onto 10 old CD-R discs in 2.5-3.0 hours), smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x DVD+RW discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing, copying and verifying everything. Backup copies of our 4 GB wedding DVD onto 8x DVD-R discs took about 15-20 minutes. ---  --- The Nero software seems very extensive, but I haven't used much of it so far. The interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do, but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the PDF manual. The only real complaint I have is with the BackItUp program's job scheduler, which only gives you daily, weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months), it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily, weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup), and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job). ---  --- Overall, great external DVD/CD drive for watching video, listening to music and backing up data. Good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement, but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. Excellent value -- bought it at Amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping, and got a $30 mail-in rebate from Sony. Also bought pack of 25 Ritek 8x DVD+RW discs from TheTechGeek.com for $33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of Velocity 8x DVD-R discs. So, for well under $200 and a little effort, you too can view, hear, copy and/or backup your valuable photos, videos, tunes and other data in no time	pos
This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first	neg
I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks.  Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks.  I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable.  I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer.  I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work.  They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company.  I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system.  I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company.  I will never again buy a Norton product.  I only wish I could get my money back from them.	neg

This gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge.  Although the clip only holds 30 rounds, the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough.  But please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s---.  I recommend blowing it up.  Anyway to answer that person's question the cocking handle is just for looks.  Now back to my review.  The scope does not have red crosshairs as i've heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws.  The foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position.  Overall this is a great gun and I would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it's only $30	pos
After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed.  The packaging arrived torn and open in several places.

TCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would've done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It's an overall good movie and I loved it	pos

This book is beautiful outside, I love the lace up binding and place for picture on the front. What I do not like is how there is no specific places to write in, you just have to use your imagination as to how to word and to position things on each page..too much like scrapbooking for me, I wanted a book with blank lines and spots to write in..For example one blank page will say, "All About Mom" then another that says "Baby Shower" etc..but the pages are blank.

After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on.  I tried all the suggestions made by the factory.  The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong.  I found totally frozen fan bearings.  I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.

If I could give it 0 star, I would. My humble opinion is that Kaspersky is not better than Norton at slowing down your computer. One brand new computer, plenty of space and memory. One old computer but with plenty of space and memory as well. Each time Kaspersky updates, I can't open Outlook Express nor Explorer. Well, the programs do open actually but I have time to vacuum and dust before they're launched. I used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement. --- Samwis	neg

now, if we're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts, but maybe just because people are lowering their standards. Besides, the fact that I dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges, this CD is no "Dangerously in Love". Where Beyonce's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album, Cole's raspy voice and sometime-y pitch concern me. --- Aside from the obvious car banger  "I Just Want It to Be Over" and the wildly popular "Love"(which Cole butchers when singing live by the way),nothing here surprises me.  Like I said , you can call me a hater, but with women like Beyonce and Fantasia around Cole's fire will probably be put out soon	neg
For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual. ---  --- I've seen Acronis True Image recommended by some both here and elsewhere. I've tried Acronis and find it lacking in one major respect: It simply is not reliable. During trials, I made backups with Acronis. Acronis indicated that the backups were successful but, when attempting to make a system recovery just minutes later, Acronis indicated that the backups were corrupted and could not be used. The backups were worthless. ---  --- When purchasing backup software remember that bells and whistles don't count for anything. The only thing that counts is reliability. It must be able to reliably restore your system. Norton Ghost passes that test with flying colors. --- 	pos
  The classic Final Fantasy games (1-3 [not 6]) are NOTORIOUS for their difficulty.  This does not hold true until you reach the center of the moon.   Then, you will find yourself guzzling Elixirs, Potions, and Ethers just to kill ONE monster.  For example, the Behemoths (found past B5 in the center of the moon, and in Bahamuts cave) will counter every spell and attack with a brutal 2300 hit on one party member.  Most of the boss fights (Asura, Bahamut) and tough monsters (Behemoths, Wicked Masks) are gimmick fights.  Bahamut is actually one of the easiest fights in the game, just cast Reflect on all of your party members. ---   Let me reinstate what the previous reviewers have said about this game --- + Crisp graphics --- + Great music + sound --- + Fun --- + More to do once you beat the game --- - Somewhat short (beat EG Zeromus in 18hrs 42mins) --- - Very difficult --- - Prepare to grind 10-15 levels once you reach the center of the moon! ---  --- I enjoyed this, and you can bet I'm getting FF3 for the DS.  Great blast from the past, a must-buy for any Final Fantasy fan, RPG lover, or GBA owner	pos
Hallmark Entertainment has made many movies from children's books, and this probably one of the worst.  Based on both "Alice in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass" this movie stars many of the familiar faces of Hallmark movies and children's movies, such as Gene Wilder, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short, and Whoopi Goldberg.  The lead character of Alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good.  The movie revolves around her, and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression.  Even the crying scenes seemed fake.  Where is Dakota Fanning when you need her?  The cinematography, costume and set design are spot on, as usual for Hallmark movies, but the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  The only bright spot was the engaging song by Gene Wilder's character.  All in all, quite boring	neg
  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality	neg
If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO	neg
Well, this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust. Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine gal--but that's why they call them movies. When are these post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them, not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations. --- Uh, another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert, something which should be, and for a time is here depicted as, a foreboding and life-threatening task. Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog; and we see the boy's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner, considering the dire situation they are in. The sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted, inane scenes. --- Look, I dig Disney kid movies--more realistic ones. You know, old style Disney movies. You take "Old Yeller" for example. Now there was a quality kid movie, and quite true to life.  --- This movie was not. It had a plastic, spoiled-American-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout. Disney has gone down the tubes. In any number of ways, they've been subverted by radical Marxist agendas (Note: One more of these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion--something called "tapping," while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-PC Judeo-Christian religion--this is bias, folks, leftwing, PC bias, same as the aforementioned feminist bilge). I am learning to run, not walk, away from Disney stuff, and this movie was further cause for me to do so.	neg

I liked these.  I was prepared for an awful stench upon opening the package, but mine didn't smell at all.  I followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture.  These noodles weren't like pasta, but they were good.  I'll have no problem eating them agian.  As a matter of fact I thought they were quite delicious	pos
I bought this over a different product because I liked the smiley face/frowny face options & they don't even work. The frowning face is on there all the time regardless of the weather. It's kind of depressing. Also I think it's off by about 1 degree in general. --- 	neg
Unlike the December 2006 review, and much like the most recent reviews, there's not much in this soup, other than very small bits of seafood and some potato.  I'm thinking that 1) the recent quality has gone downhill, or 2) the December 2006 review was a "plant."  Anyway, the taste was okay, but it definitely doesn't rate up there with Legal Seafood (which I've had at one of the restaurants, and at the Boston airport, both much better than this)	pos
I bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here. I'm not sure if I got a defective unit but I've had these problems from the gitgo: ---  --- -I noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly, they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you'd need force to expand/retract them. Very interestingly, if the section right above the one I'm trying to expand/retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless! --- -The ballhead does not support my Nikon D80 and lightest lens (18-55mm) a less than 2 lbs combo, which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs. The camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard I try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly. ---  --- Again, it might have been a defective unit, but I thought I'd point my observations out anyway. I wanted to buy this from Amazon, it wasn't in stock, it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available Amazon bumped the price to $40+, so I went elsewhere and got it for $30.	neg
Buy anything.  Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you'll get pretty much the same end result.  I don't have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it's still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible.  I had a Diaper Genie with my older son (now 4) and gave it to my brother.  I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag....woo hoo...NO REFILLS!!!  So for three months now (that's how old my little butterball is now) I've used the Diaper Champ and the first day it's not so bad (maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags (for the prayer that they won't break when I'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop) which also have Odor Shield (so the bags start out smelling so nice!) but already by day two, my husband is walking in the nursery saying "HOOOOOOONEY, it smellllllls!  I clean the thing all the time....the stench remains.  This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online.  I feel like throwing a party when it gets here.  I'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house. 	neg

My 10 year old received the Massively Mini Media Player for Christmas and she and I both are very disappointed in it.

5 Stars for the Stevia product...natural, delicious! 0 Stars for Amazon's inability to correctly store this item in their warehouses. I experienced the same trouble as other reviewers, packets showing up hard and useless. When purchased in the store, I have never had one hard or brittle packet. Don't bother purchasing from Amazon, instead head to your local Trader Joe's where you can purchase 100 packets for $5.99. Not the fiber supplement type, but doesn't clump and more per packet. Amazon really shouldn't even bother selling this product if the Stevia shows up ruined	neg
I recently viewed this film when it was broadcast on television, and I must say that it was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Part of the spy genre, Quiller travels to Berlin to investigate the resurgence of a group of Nazis and it is necessary for him to uncover where their base is located. As with any spy thriller, it is difficult at times to differentiate between a supposed friend and and an enemy. One keeps wondering if Quiller is indeed placing his trust on the right people, particularly those who claim to be on his side. Quiller is a spy who doesn't carry a gun, noting that he is less likely to be killed if he is not armed. Despite his intelligence and wit, he still gets caught in precarious situations. Impeccable acting accompanied by astute dialogue make this a compelling piece to watch over and over again	pos

The one song I know is a remake is "Goodnight My Love."  I know this because I have it on the original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake.

I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday.  After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back.  She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game.  My daughter has always played a lot of "simulated life" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin).  I suspect this is why she found this game limiting.  Other games that she has played portray a more intricate "life" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree.  My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this.  If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine.  However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking.   	neg
This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts. I bought it in the spring and this fall, with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage. I don't really think its worth the money. It is very spacious, just wish it was better made.	neg
This is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports.  It is easy to use and not too bulky.

I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck.

OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters. ---  --- The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!? ---  --- Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics	neg

Billy Elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class (meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike). ---  --- This is the classic "family doesn't initially understand," "teacher believes in him," "screws up audition but spirit carries him through" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out. ---  --- The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring. ---  --- The beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real "feel good" part of the movie	pos
It's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select side 1 of "Rust Never Sleeps." It took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of "Rust Never Sleeps." My flatmates never complained. ---  --- Oddly, the songs I see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves. You don't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar, contagious handclaps, and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of "Welfare Mothers," now, do you really? As for "Sedan Delivery," I have only the vaguest clue of what it's about, but it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job). Allright, maybe we don't need two versions of "Hey Hey, My My," but which one would you delete?  ---  --- As far as I'm concerned, there's only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: "Sail Away," which is innocuously pretty, but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff. "Trasher" and "Pocahontas" are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places. Poor Marlon, poor CSN. ---  --- Do I wax nostalgiac? Perhaps, but not overly so. This remains essential Neil, which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets. It still sounds fresh and relevant. And fun. Did I mention fun? In fact, I'm gonna go plunk it on right now, maybe take a breather between "Sail Away" and "Powderfinger" to relive the LP experience. You should too. ---    	pos

I have used Bic and Papermate ballpoint pens for years. However, I finally got tired of them not working half the time. I was at my Doctors office one day and used the girls pen at the front desk to sign in. She had this Pilot G-2 Gel pen. I loved the way it wrote and the way it felt in my hand. It has a rubber grip and you can see when you are running low on ink. It writes the first time and evertime right out of the package. Not at all like the Bic and other ballpoint pens. I am hooked, I will never go back to ballpoint pens again. I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $2.50 for a two pack. They also have the refills for them also. Unless you write a bunch these two will last a long while before you need to buy refills for them. They came in Red, Black, Blue, and other colors also. I got the blue extra fine point. I highly recommend these Gel pens.	pos

We have a really bad bug problem (inherited with the trailer when we got it) - these things do work - no bugs in my sisters or mothers houses anymore, but we do still have bugs.  We do move  the 2 units around as recommended - bugs can get use to them.  Also stuff in your house can absorb the noise making them less effective - we are wall to wall stuff with 3 kids in a tiny trailer.  To effectively do our trailer would take 8 - 10 units.  Bugs that we do see are easier to catch and seem disoriented.   These buzzers are best used in wide open spaces with minor to middling bug problems.  The spiders and beetles and moths have totally disappered though.   Our dog hates the things when we move one over by her bed.   So, these units need to be moved every 2-4 weeks.  You need multiple units - 1 for every 200 sq. ft. at least - if you have lots of furniture or smaller rooms, then more - they don't work through walls or furniture.  You need at least one for every room that you have a problem.  It takes 2 - 3 weeks to really start to see results.  Works better if you have fewer bugs - for a really bad bug problem - use in conjunction with other solutions	pos
This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he knew what he was talking about. ---  --- I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. I say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. When you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. I gave it a low rating because I have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book	neg
From the moment she glimpses her idol on Broadway, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) strives relentlessly to upstage Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  Cunningly, Eve steals Margo's role, smashes Margo's best friend, Karen Richards' (Celeste Holm) marriage, and becomes the toast of Broadway!  Great performances all around with some of the juiciest, wittiest, and oh so quotable ("Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night") dialogue ever!  I don't know if the film would have worked as well without the suave and sophisticated performance by George Sanders (Rebecca (1939), he is truly remarkable as the story's narrator and Broadway critic, Addison DeWitt.  This film also marks the screen debut of legendary beauty, Marilyn Monroe, who plays a bit part as Addison's lovely date at Bill's welcome home party.  Even here Marilyn's astonishing screen presence and simmering sensuality (of which she would later ride to fame on) is clearly evident. ---  --- "All About Eve" has been hailed as "One of the smartest pictures of all time....a picture for any era" by the L.A. Times, and Variety put it simply best as "Captivating!"  It's interesting to see Bette Davis and co-starring romantic lead, Gary Merrill (who play's Margo's lover Bill Sampson) play out their scenes together, for in real life they actually marry and similar odds ends their relationship.  It's all told in the included Special Feature, AMC's "Backstory" telling all about "All About Eve."  Anne Baxter and Celeste Holm are featured in the interviews and give some interesting insights on the film and it's "behind the scenes" antics.  Bette Davis and Gary Merrill should also not be missed in the 1952 suspense classic, "Another Man's Poison."  A new dvd release of this picture would be much appreciated, for the current release is discontinued.   ---  --- Also included in the Special Features is the film's Gala Premiere footage / 1951 Academy Award footage, in which "All About Eve" won 1950's Best Picture / Theatrical trailer for "All About Eve," "Gentlemen's Agreement," and "How Green Was My Valley," are also included.   ---  --- If you're a classic movie buff, you don't need to be told anything about "All About Eve," you will have already discovered it a long time ago.  I don't have to tell you how essential it is to add it to your dvd library, for you either have it already or have placed it on order -click "add to cart" NOW!	pos

This is one of my favorites. I love the scent. It doesn't smell like fresh strawberries because it's not supposed to.

Thirty five years ago my high school (Thomas Jefferson, in Federal Way, Washington) held annual competitions in mathematics.  They did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet, just was a few pages long.  There weren't many questions, perhaps a dozen or two (usually in the form of story problems), but they required deep thought and concentration (at least for me).  I still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as I took the "white book" and opened it to the first problem.  Several hours later I'd consider myself accomplished if I'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions.   ---  --- Ian Stewart's book reminds me of those tests.  Here's a sampling of what's inside: ---  --- 1)Mrs. Anne-Lida Worm decides she wants a new couch, and tells Mr. Worm to get it for her, while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby Wermintrude.  But Anne-Lina doesn't want just any couch.  She wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house, and around the 90-degree hall at the end.  What shape does the couch have, and how big is it?  This is a truly riveting story.  Will Mr. Worm solve the couch problem in time?   ---  --- 2)Alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes, evaluating the influence of different soils.  He wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine.  His land is on a hillside, though, which is narrow, so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land.  How can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species, where any two plots have exactly one variety in common, and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot? ---  --- Sixteen chapters make up this book.  Though their titles are whimsical, the mathematical problems aren't.  Some are still unsolved.  Even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics, they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions, and developed insight along the way, that are at once challenging and rewarding.  Here's a sample of some of other topics discussed in Stewart's book: ---  --- How might one transport a lion, llama, and head of lettuce in a boat, across a lake, without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker?  How can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve?  How can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place?  Suppose that you need to tile a room, and the tiles come in odd shapes.  Is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution?  Can mathematics tell us things about evolution, such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts (or both)?   ---  --- This is a fun, lighthearted book, but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think.  I enjoy reading as I exercise on my elliptical machine.  I get double the sense of accomplishment when I can read and workout at the same time.  Ordinarily, I can estimate how long I've been on the machine by how many pages I've read - 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average.  But with Stewart's book I had to be careful.  Several times I found that I'd worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half-a-dozen pages or so.   ---  --- If you love mathematics, particularly mathematical puzzles, then this is a book you'll really enjoy.  It has many problems for the reader, with answers at the back of each chapter.  If you do the problems and understand everything in the book, in detail, it will occupy many hours of your time.  All in deep thought and utter enjoyment.   	pos

The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me.

This is my favorite film of all time! --- I am sad to say that most people have never even heard of it - ---  It was an Acadamy Award winner, so I don't understand why it's not gotten much attention over the years... --- I find it  superior to other classics which seem to have withstood the test of time better than Captains Courageous. --- I don't know why this is the case, but I am it's biggest advocate - urging all my friends to see it... --- It is a wonderful and moving story, that will bring me to tears time and time again the same way as "It's a Wonderful Life Does"... --- If you have strong values and a warm heart - this movie is for you! --- Do not miss it	pos
Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!  --- Splenda Flavor Blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. Please note that this is not a creamer. It sweetens/flavors coffee. If you find you just have to have creamer to "tame" down your coffee you can add a Splenda Flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy, buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the Splenda Flavor blends. --- Lots of times, I find products with Splenda already in them to be too sweet but I didn't think that was the case with this. All three of the available flavors (hazelnut, mocha, vanilla) taste great without being overpowering.  --- Finally, now I can kick that fatty creamer bad habit!	pos
I SAW THIS MOVIE 'CAUSE I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE CATHY RIGBY, "WHO WAS BORN TO PLAY PETER PAN". I HATED IT A LOT. SO, NOW I AM IN A HIGH SCHOOL PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN, AND I HAPPEND TO SEE THE MARY MARTIN VERSION, AND THE MARY MARTAIN CD. I LOVED IT! THEN I REALIZED THAT 'PETER PAN' IS NOT A BAD MUSICAL AT ALL. CATHY RIGBY AND THE "CREW" WERE MAKING IT BAD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY THINK CATHY RIGBY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. SHE ISN'T. SHE SOUNDED LIKE SHE WAS A STUIPED LITTLE BRAT THAT JUST WANTED TO ROT THE REST OF HIS [HER] TIME JUST SITTING IN A DARK CORNER CARVING FORKS WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MARY MARTAIN SOUNDS ALL CHEERFUL, FUN, AND REAL. I RECCOMEND MARY MARTAIN'S VIDEO AND CD. I SAY NO MORE	neg
First heard his stand-up on CD when I worked at Borders a few years back.  Sometimes he gets a bit carried away (a lotta comics tend to, though), and his comedy comes across dopey, yet easy to relate to.  Clean (no naughty words or uncouth situations here!), family-fun comedy (dirty or clean, as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well, then he/she is funny in my eyes)	pos

This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.

The mouse is perfect for games. I use it to play ET and is great. The software provided by Logitech is configurable in all ways	pos
If you're one of those people like me, who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time, now is the time to upgrade.  You won't be disappointed.  Just ask the editors of both PC Magazine and C|Net which awarded this version their Editor's Choice Award. ---  --- Once again Adobe has listened to its loyal customer base.  The proof is in the new version of Illustrator.  Many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn't even think of.  I was happy to find out that even with the new features, Adobe has not altered Illustrator's previous palettes or keyboard commands.  There's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version.  No fear here! ---  --- First of all, I want to say that I am really impressed with the Live Trace and Live Paint features, especially when used together.   We all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer.  We end up drawing it out on a napkin, paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment.  Normally, once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using Illustrator which takes both time and effort---not any more. ---  --- Take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in.  Once the image has been scanned, then the fun begins.  Once the image has been scanned in and brought into Illustrator CS2, use the Live Trace feature to actually trace your drawing.  This feature actually turns to drawing into a Live Trace object for easy manipulation.  After applying some blurring as needed, your traced image is cleared up.  Then, convert your Live Trace object into a Live Paint object using the new Control Palette.  I like the Live Paint tool also because it reminds me of working in Photoshop. ---  --- Once you've converted to the Live Paint object, you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking.  Live Paint also has a feature called Gap Detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line.  This is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later.  When the object outlines are finalized, use the Live Paint feature to easily fill any region with color.  Voila!  You are done.  Go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes. ---  --- A concern of many of us for years was the fact that while Illustrator keep getting better and newer features, it also mean more and more palettes.  Sometimes it became a little unmanageable.  However, the pros at Adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution - the Control palette.  This new palette sits at the top of the screen.  First, it acts as a an object inspector providing information.  Secondly, (and more importantly), the Control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus, brush shape, opacity, and style.  No longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features.  If you are fans of Adobe's other Creative Suite 2 software, you will be pleased to learn that the Control Palette is apart of their new makeover too. ---  --- Here are some more new additions and changes to Illustrator: ---  --- * Like Photoshop, Illustrator CS2 now supports custom workspaces.  You can display only the palettes you need at any time. You are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates. --- * Adobe has improved the Swatch and color integration.  Now, working with the other Creative Suite 2 programs is seamless. --- * Isolation Mode is a feature that allows you to double-click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the Layers Palette. --- * CS2 now supports all of the latest Wacom tablets. It now provides brush support for the new Wacom 6D Art Pen and adds a new dimension Illustrator's Calligraphic and Scatter brushes --- * Adobe Bridge integration is now a part of Illustrator CS2.  Bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow. --- * Macromedia Flash exports are now available.  You can export both text and objects as Flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects. --- * You can now open Photoshop files with layer comps within Illustrator.  This new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time, just as you do in Photoshop --- * Custom stroke placement is a new addition to Illustrator. You can now place strokes on the outside, inside or center of a path. --- * Underline and Strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements. --- * These are a few of the new features! ---  --- The $169 upgrade cost is well worth the money, just for the Live Trace and Live Paint features alone.  However, you get so much more in the new Illustrator CS2.  Upgrade now and be completely satisfied.  If you haven't purchased a vector graphics program, get Illustrator, especially if you are already an owner of a version of Photoshop.  This new version of Illustrator even looks more like the familiar Photoshop layout. ---  --- Loren Elks --- Group Manager, D-MAG.org	pos

for $10 these were too good to pass up.  First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece.  First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.    ---  --- This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine.

I love to hear old standards and such.  But I like to hear people who put their own take on it.   I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe.  Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention.  So, hmmm, nevermind.  I guess it's always been that way	neg

Shakespeare's life is frustratingly beyond our sight. Aside from the plays (which, in many cases, come down to us in different versions), we have a slim scattering of legal documents, marriage and birth records, and vague secondary accounts.  ---  --- As the world's preeminent Shakespeare scholar, Greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and, with a healthy dose of conjecture, arrive at something resembling a biography of the world's greatest dramatist. More than that, though, this work is a biography of the age in which Shakespeare lived and wrote---Elizabethan and Jacobian London---and how the major events of this time affected Shakespeare's plays. For example, the writing of King Lear may have been encouraged by a trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and estate, while the youngest daughter (named Cordell) tried to stop them---a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the Bard's greatest tragedy.  ---  --- What impressed me the most about this biography is how ORDINARY Shakespeare seemingly was. He didn't seem pretentious or snobbish, as some people envision him. He was born to a humble family and lived frugally, despite dying a rather wealthy man. ---  --- Although Greenblatt's writing is clear and accessible, he makes the assumption that you have already read Shakespeare's plays, or at least are VERY familiar with them. I have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when he discussed plays I hadn't read, so if you haven't read more than, say, ten of his plays, the major ones, you need to crack open the Norton Shakespeare (of which Greenblatt is the editor-in-chief) before you approach Will in the World.  ---  ---   	pos

My 21 month old daughter received Baby Pooh for Christmas and plays with him EVERY day. She loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change, and bathes with him nightly. He comes with a duckie and bottle of his own. The high chair back does not stay attached to the chair, but Pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter. Pooh is made from hard plastic and, sadly, his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. My daugher is handling the trauma OK, but we are getting her an new Pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much. I recommend it	pos

This pasta is very good.  It works great in salads, casseroles or regular pasta dishes.  I've only been gluten free for a few months and I think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta.

Dr. Mark Albion is a consistent and heartfelt--seemingly lone, sometimes--voice of responsibility and truth in what's often a cynical, clutching corporate world.  I was energized by his first book, "Making a Life, Making a Living (ML2)" and empowered by "True to Yourself." ---  --- Albion builds upon the strengths of ML2 in his most recent title with practical, actionable strategies for transforming your business or career into one of real social value.  Readers walk away with principles they can start executing tomorrow, and a re-calibrated moral compass by which to measure their progress. ---  --- And Albion lives it:  While admittedly starting out with some privilege, he bravely walked away from a tenured position at Harvard Business School (simply unheard of) to follow his heart.  To this day, Albion continues to shun the easy money, and lives his life by the values he preaches.  You can practically count on one hand the number of businesspeople out there who truly walk the talk. ---  --- Whether it be the insatiable drive for "more," or just the rudimentary economics of opening the doors everyday, any business can very quickly shake you free from your social moorings.  If you feel like you've lost your way, or just need some inspirational words ahead of that next challenge, "True to Yourself" is the book for you	pos

I have owned and broken most grabbers on the market. The fold-up Gopher is a joke, another, with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use, and the heavy-duty unit from Lowes is hard on the wrist. This unit is the smart way to go!

Please do not waste your money	neg
Occasionally when I go to the grocery store I pick up a magazine by the check out counter. So I bought an issue of Fitness magazine and then decided to get a subscription. I don't know what the heck I was thinking. Each time I got the issue I noticed there was always some skinny blond chick on the cover wearing a bikini.  There were NEVER any women of color on the cover. So when I was sent a letter, asking if I'd like to renew my subscription, I said he11 no. I'm not wasting my money on a so-called fitness magazine that doesn't feature women of color on its cover. There's just no way. I thought fitness was for everybody, not just for skinny blondes who wear bikinis. And just because your skinny doesn't make you `fit' either. Skip this if possible	neg
Length of ownership: 8 weeks ---  --- This puppy really reaches out. My laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the Hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. Thanks to some friendly neighbors I've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections, and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi I'll get by with that thanks to this neat Hawking device. ---  --- Unless I need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices I hope the Hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far, albeit good ones. ---  --- Note: For me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. Also, placement by a window will help your reception	pos

The first time you play this CD you're just gonna hate it. Promise Ring's third album is the opposite of this. Very Emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick of it quick, there's just not much there. That understood, this album will rock you for years. It grows on you. At first listen it sounds like really bad emo demos. Like the faceless band you saw open for Fugazi the last time they hobbled into town. No hooks, no choruses, lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar [with the drums mixed way too loud, an emo thing]. On the 100th listen, if you make it that far, it will sound like an old friend yammerin' on about the good old days. Trust me, it's a desert island disc in the making, I envy those of you just discovering this Cd	pos

My husband is a NYC doorman so we found it very fitting to decorate our son's room in this theme. Since my hubby deals with taxi's and limo's on a daily basis we thought it was very cute that the main theme of this set had those things in it. We also love Manhattan and are there often so we brought a little bit of it out to our house in L.I. The set is very well made and I like the fact that since it feels like it will last, my son can grown with it. It is also not too pastel and babyish that he can use it well into his toddler and pre-school years	pos

I do television editing for my church and I dabble alittle at home. I have many editing programs that I use for music and video editing of home movies from cams and 8mm.I had nero 6 and it was ok, but nero7 ultra (enhanced) has taken the place of all the other programs. It is my primary editing suite for music and videos. for music I can make changes to songs for skating programs where I would have to send out to have words removed or create a cd for pleasure.This program is remarkable, there are still somethings I have not yet used, this was the best but in this type of program for under $800.00 that is how much the programs that we use in the studio starting price is. Buying this program will be a great investment.	pos
For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)	pos

It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story. ---  --- I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species. ---  --- If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage	neg
Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah... ---  --- The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night? ---  --- Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money	neg
I bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the Dollar Tree. When i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures I decided to give them a try. I have two complaints with this product. One, the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and I could'nt get one of the phones to communicate.

As I get older I like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive.

The photo shows four containers, each 9oz.  The product is actually only one 9oz. container.  Very misleading, possibly intentionally so.  Also, shipping costs $10 for a $9 product?

...but the game was too simple and too short.  I do like Creature of Kapu Cave better than Danger by Design.   ---  --- While I appreciate the quality of graphics, sound effects, and music, it seems like the producers of the Nancy Drew games have changed hands in recent years.  We're seeing a stark difference in the newer games compared to their past games such as: Shadow Ranch, Danger on Deception Island, Treasure in Royal Tower, etc.  (Those games are fantastic!)  With the recent games, play is not as fluid, the tasks are too simple-minded, there's not much mystery or suspense (if any), and game play time is too short. ---  --- In 'Creature', you can collect shells and make necklaces and you can go fishing - for as long as you want to!  Or until you get bored with it.  The beach and water graphics are cool.  There is some humor with some the character conversations.  I enjoyed that.   ---  --- You get to move between four locations that intertwine and make sense.  I didn't see any problem with the auto-switching (via cell phone calls) between Nancy and the Hardy Boys.  That was not a problem for me.  I almost rated this a 3 star, but gave it 4 due to the graphics, characters, and variety of locations. ---  --- Hopefully, Her Interactive will hear their customers disappointments and revamp upcoming games.  Fans do want the Nancy Drew games to keep coming	pos
If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.

Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me	neg
This is just incredible. Many subtle layers of scents, non of them too strong or overpowering, despite the fact that this will stay with you all day long ( no need to respray, in other words, so it's a great value for the price ).

I am happy to say there is really nothing I can compare it too - and that's a good thing, it's not "samey" like so many men's fragrances out today, and not feminine at all. Very nice.	pos

My family never knows that the recipes are light and I'm actually somewhat happy about sitting down and planning out meals. The recipes are also a mix of complicated and simple, fruit and desert, main dishes and salads. I buy subscriptions as gifts. Plus, there's not one iota of advertising in this beautifully photographed magazine. Refreshing! Mary in P	pos
We already have the base unit for this product and have previously added another sensor which worked so well, that we have now added a third sensor.  In addition, we have bought the base unit as gifts and have now bought additional sensors for those that we bought the base unit for.  We like to be able to check the temperature in our motorhome, especially during the winter, as well as the garage, attic, etc. My husband moves the sensors to other locations from time to time and has been very impressed with the whole system	pos
I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too.  I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport.  The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair.  The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless.  Save your money on this one	neg
Great boots.  Perfect for playing in the rain.  Great Quality.  I bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season.  No problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size.  We previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs	pos
This cooking set was on sale and even with shipping beat the "best" prices locally.  I gave it to my son as a gift, and he was thrilled to get it.  It included the pots, lids, lifter that were also good quality.  Very nice set.  Good quality/good value	pos
I saw these reading glasses on CSI:NY and just had to have them! It's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses...and the WOW factor doesn't hurt either! I've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses. My hair is shortish (layered to the bottom of my neck) and I wouldn't want it any longer if I was going to wear these glasses a lot...which I do! They aren't portable...but they aren't supposed to be. I keep mine in my office where I need to take them on and off the most frequently. I'll probably get another pair for home but I'll used my old ones I can put in my case for carrying in my purse. All in all...I'm very glad I got them	pos

I've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the Butthead Golf Club Cover, and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been Playworld Putt Putt. There's also no dress code involved there. ---  --- Now, on to the review! ---  --- I strongly endorse this Butthead Golf Club Cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten: fun! Those teets really help my handicap like you wouldn't believe. Many clubs have a problem with this cover, because they're incredibly elitist, but when I think of golf, I think of cow teets, and that's why I refuse to play without it	pos

Being from Midland you might say I'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie.  This movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period - in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released (that's how fast the bust hit).  Terry Jastrow (who is from Midland) and his real life wife Anne Archer are great opposite each other on the screen while Mary Kay Place provides great commentary on life in Texas Oil Business	pos
Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money.  I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price.  Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less!

Unfortunately Xenosaga I - Der Wille zur Macht is never come to Europe. But as the second Xenosaga (Jenseits von Gut und Bse) was released in Germany in November I was very happy. --- So I played it and was impressed of this cool story and gameplay!

I have had the Harmony for seven months and use it about 2-3 times a day.  It it still working great with all the original parts.  I have not had to buy replacement anything.  I do admit I recently tried another pump. It was supposed to more closly mimic a suckling baby.  With in two days I called the company, I got a refund and am back to my Harmony.  This is a great pump and I am so happy that we bought it.  Stop searching and buy this pump	pos
I was more than pleased when I received this pendant! It has a nice feel and you actually know it's there, instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away.

The leather case has a magnetc latch, the magnetic force is strong enough for an SD card to stick onto it.  I have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire, but I decided not to chance it. I am surprised that Canon cautions against placing the camera in Strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature! ---  --- Although constructed of fine leather, the case is also very bulky, making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse. ---  --- The neck strap is OK, it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing, making it look quite cheap and stiff, again increasing the bulk of the camera. ---  --- The battery works fine, but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money	neg
I'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life. I'm still bemused and puzzled the mechanics of toilet-flushing. My wife (may she rest in peace) bought me this book as an anniversary present last month before she was tragically torn apart by a rabid pack of alligators at a Wyoming nature preserve. Anyway, life moves on. ---  --- Much to my disappointment this book did not teach me everything I should know how to do. "But Fred," you might be saying (and I'll be saying "Fred isn't my name, idiot!"), "how do you know what you should know if you don't know what it is to begin with?" ---  --- Ah, well, let me explain. See, if Tchikavoslky taught me one thought, it was this: I know nothing. ---  --- So it is with this deep insight into my own mind that I came up with the following Things I Should Know, based on what I currently do NOT know: ---  --- 1. How to start a hurricane. This is very important. ---  --- 2. How to kill a man with a toothpick. What if you met a hitman at a fancy restaurant and found out your were his next victim? Scary. ---  --- 3. How to run a nuclear powerplant with a one-man army. I don't want to be the next Homer Simpson! ---  --- 4. How to raise children. I've raised ten and still haven't figured out what a diaper is. ---  --- 5. What a diaper is. I don't know, my wife used to talk about them a lot. ---  --- 6. How to drive. Sure, technically we're supposed to learn how BEFORE we get our driver's licenses, but like many people, I just got a fake one when I was 12 and have been driving since then. I've been in over three hundred vehicular accidents and been charged with five counts of manslaughter, so I figured it might be good to learn how to drive. ---  --- 7. How to stalk a celebrity. You just never know. ---  --- 8. How to put on underwear without leaving stain marks. You fellas know what I'm saying! ---  --- 9. How to make coffee. People ask me to all the time, and because I don't know how, I just take some warm water and pour mud in. Thankfully no one's noticed my inadequacies yet, but I'm sure soon enough they will, after another person dies of food poisoning and internal infection. ---  --- 10. How to kill yourself. I don't want the aliens to get anything out of me when I'm taken hostage. I saw it in that Tom Cruise movie, and it was sure scary! ---  --- So with these things in mind, I'm severely disappointed by this book, and feel it is mis-marketed and stupid. ---  --- Please, Barbet Schroeder (or whoever the author was), write a better book next time	neg
I am a fan of Arena Football.  I enjoy watching it because it is exciting, but this game doesn't live up to the real game.  The game is very similiar to NFL Blitz except NFL Blitz is better.  What makes Unleashed worse is  there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass.  The most action  comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each  other up.  If you are thinking of buying this game, rent it first to see if  it is really worth the money	pos

It would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the Mahler Eighth ever recorded; I believe it is. But it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something, because after experiencing this colossal achievement, the competition (including, alphabetically, Abbado, Bernstein, Chailly, Haitink, Horenstein, Kubelik, Nagano, Olson [Colorado Mahlerfest], Solti, and Tennstedt, among others) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had. What sets this Mahler Eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy; of a transcendent vision being communicated, of a religious fervor. Mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work, such that he could bring us to the brink and say, "There. It's out there. You can't see it, but you can divine it" (and call "it" what you will: "God" or "Love" or some all-embracing power outside of ourselves). Most performances miss the mark, then, in one of two ways: by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand. The problem, of course, is that if we can understand it, it's no longer a vision, it's something mundane. In the closing pages of Wit's extraordinary (and that word, as well as any other, hardly begins to do it justice) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension. You know it's there only because you're willing to take that leap of faith. And that's what I mean when I say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor. There is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion I'm referring to here. ---  --- So let's look at the basic components of the performance, element by element: ---  --- The sound: Spectacularly natural and all-encompassing. The soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra, and the chorus, orchestra, and organ blend to perfection. ---  --- The soloists: To a letter the finest group I have ever heard. There's a distinctly Slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given Mahler's Bohemian roots, and a refreshing lack of self-importance. No operatic grandstanding here. And for the first time ever I felt as though I was missing something by not following the words (no libretto is provided, though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing. They weren't going through the motions, making pretty sounds. They had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it. To be honest, part II has often bored me to tears (with Chailly's performance being particularly offensive in this regard) but here I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout, impatient to hear what (and who) came next. And throughout it all, so importantly, there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end. ---  --- The choruses: Easily the best I've ever heard. The way they rip into "Hostem repellas longius" with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part I is unforgettable, and the fugue itself, which has never reminded me more of the "rabble" section from the first movement of Mahler's Third, literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course. That's nothing. I got chills right at the beginning of the Chorus Mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated! I have NEVER experienced anything like that before. Ever. And I don't just mean while listening to music. ---  --- The conductor: What can I say? He holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before. How? I have no idea, but when the start of part II doesn't jar, as it usually does, you know you're in for something special. Maybe it's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual, or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part (the first entry of the soloists, for instance, is so raptly caressing). ---  --- The orchestra: While they don't have the "Mahler sound" that the Concertgebouw or Vienna Philharmonic may produce, there's an earthiness (but never sloppiness) that sets them far apart from the bleached, sterile sound of too many American orchestras that make Mahler sound not like Mahler. ---  --- To sum up, then, I could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording, and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it, especially those radiant, visionary, and extraordinary closing pages. Record of the year; record of the century! It crowns not merely my Mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music.	pos

I have now seen several Gerry Anderson projects, many hits and some misses, this one is close to dead last for me (wait, it is dead last). A priest driving a model T is the hero in this one. He also has a shrinking ray (shrinks to like 1/3 normal) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent. Sound interesting? Well, I got the set cheap so why not buy it? If your an Anderson fan as I am, it was worth the price, just don't expect to show it to your friends as it's really tame and slow plodding with model T car chases and not a whole lot of action. Here is my ranking of the shows I like from Gerry Anderson so take that into account of your own tastes. #1 UFO (a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development), #2 Joe 90(the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here), #3 Captain Scarlet (I love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me), #4 Thunderbirds (had a Corgi toy as a kid, it was the best show for kids on TV at the time), #5 Stingray (for the time, it was a great action kids show), #6 Fireball XL5 (like a Stingray except in space and black and white), #7 The Protectors (eh, it's OK), #8 Space 1999 (this is where my recommended shows stop, this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even I couldn't stay with it in the 70's),#9 Terrahawks (just started watching it now it may move up above Space 1999 and the Protectors), #10 Secret Service. I haven't watched his other stuff and I know there is stuff out there like Supercar but that would probably rank above Secret Service for me.    	neg

A great series concept - highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the  American Music Library. Ofcourse the originally withdrawn [w. new  at-the-time Funky people] "Talkin' Loud.." by JB (I bought it  retail! ) is the highlight, along with the live  "It's My  Thing..." by Marva Whitney. (Yes, I saw MW sing it **l-i-v-e** at  Madison Square Garden in July, 1969). The prev. unrel. Bobby Byrd track and  Vicki Anderson's contribution to the "Cold Sweat" session also  reinforce the value for listeners	pos

I have used three of these.  The first two each lasted a year before shorting out.  I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function.

It's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market. 	neg

Spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played.  It was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating.  There are alot of Xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old. This game was not meant for an adult gaming audience.  I was surprised when I realized this game is no longer in production.  There should be more games for the 5-10 age bracket.  My son loves this game.  He literally wore it out.  I have to find him another copy of Hero's Tail to replace his old one	pos

  I purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework, and reading all the reviews I could on the different kinds. The one I purchased was flawed, and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before I could get it to boot up. When it was running I was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures. ---   What the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable- so it does not hook up to a computer. This means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera, or that you must have/purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card.( A side note - if you have a Sony digital camera, Memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent, you took with another camera, or you reformatted with a photo program).  ---   I went with the digital pic frame from Brookstone instead - far better quality, and MUCH more user friendly	neg

Now i dont usually write reviews for things, but when i do its because i really like it or i really hate it. And i must say this is one of the best, if not the best music magazine out there. But before you go on if you like bands like simple plan or new found glory just stop and go read something else. this magazine is for indie rock fans or just plain rock. They give you reviews on at least 30 albums and have great interviews with artists. Now this is not like "Spin" who jumps on anything that is popular at the moment to make some money. I enjoyed reading this summers issue ( with Death Cab for Cutie on the front) so much that I ordered it the day i got the magazine. A must have for indie fans	pos
This works great for charging both my DS Lite and classic DS from USB. I also like the included keychain flashlight- it's kind of random thing to include that is in no way related to the charger, but it's quite bright and handy to have anyways. ---  --- I'm not sure why the previous reviewer says that it doesn't fit the DS Lite- it does, perfectly. Perhaps she is trying to use the GBA Micro adapter that is included? You don't need to- the adapter is only to charge classic DS/GBA or GBA Micro- the cable itself is all you need to charge DS Lite	pos
I am new to the world of gourmet salts--and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago!  The granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel--but that is where the similiarities end.  The salt dissolves instantly on the tongue; it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste.  The jar suggests it be used  on grilled fish and salads, but I would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also. 	pos
I will try to keep this brief... by the way I'm only 10 hrs thru... only just got out of City #1 Rabernastre, Dalmasca and now in city #2 Bahjerba (sp?): ---  --- Quickly, my first impressions of the game were strange... I was like "MEH I dunno if I want to keep playing..." but after maybe 20 min of getting of the 'wierdness' it really sucks you in. Ughh I really wish I didn't have midterms coming up so I could go home and play! ---  --- Pros: --- - Love the battle system! It's still strategy but it doesn't require you to have random battles... ughh I'd hate the "whzzzhhh" of the starting of random battles... I can still feel in control but doing less actual work. --- - Like everyone else says, CG always good. --- - Story... though not as much character development/focus as previous ones, I do like the whole war/polity centered plot. It does follow FFT's tradition. --- - I actually like the license board... some people have said it's a pain in the beginning, but so far it hasn't been the case for me... granted I did very early in the game decide to level up Vaan a bit (~40 min or so). You really just need to know to only use the board when you really need to... don't randomly buy spots on the board just as things become available as its difficult for one person to learn EVERYTHING. Plan, plan, plan. (Right now by the way I'm constructing my chars in the way the game hints at... its only one way to do it, but first time around I'll follow it... the already licensed equipment/abilities hint at what they'll be good at.) --- - HUGE game. Lots of stuff to see... and quite beautiful. --- - Character design... course there is always someone to love... (Har har har... as a fangirl I must say I love Basch :D lol... tho I love the babyface of earlier FF characters I think Vaan is too babyfaced. He looks like a kid.--haha I'm a college student and such a fangirl... haha... sad isn't it?--If I were a guy, I'd say I'd like Fran the most... this is of course subject to personal opinion.) --- - I like subs and I like how they are not bland... they have fancy font this time :D. (Kinda reminds me of Nochnoi Dozor.) Makes the game really movie-ish. --- - Widescreen capability... (Looks SWEET on my widescreen PC monitor.) --- - Course everyone always talks about the realism of selling pelts and what not... I also like that. --- - Free-moving camera... Thank heaven for that. I LOVE it. I hated the still camera immensely in FFX. --- - Cute monsters... lol love the cactuar like monster and the rogue tomato! --- - Also love how you can avoid some boss moves by skillfully moving around them. ---  --- Cons: --- - HUGE game... (yes also a con)... lots of time running around. Good thing all the characters don't run as painstakingly slow as Tidus did in FFX. ---  --- Meh... neutral: --- - Voices - I dunno what is up with people liking the previous FF's voice actors but anyhoo I thought this time there were better ones. The prev. FF's voice actors were okay but not great. Here the voice actors are really good, but the choice of some of them seems strange... like I have a problem with Fran's voice... it was a strange choice and a strange voice. Also Balthier's voice doesn't seem to go with his look, but I really do like the voice acting by itself. (In sum, some voices, though really well acted, didn't seem to fit the actor's look... however, I do favor good actors with mismatched roles over okay actors with well-matched roles so I  give the voice acting a mild thumbs up.) After reading a review which mentioned mispronunciations, I feel I must also address that... As someone who speaks some French I did twitch when I heard "Marquis" pronounced both as "Markus" and "Marquis" rather than "Markee." I also did twitch when they pronounced "fete" as "feet" rather than "feh-t." --- - Soundtrack - I liked all the music (there was a lot) taken from FFT... esp the battle music in the Estersand, I think it is... totally taken from FFT (obviously as both take place in the same world)... I did enjoy the non-midi renditions of the themes... but the rest of the new guy's music was just 'meh'... wasn't particularly bad, but it didn't really stand out much either	pos
This has been a good purchase for us.  We are in northern Italy for about 7 weeks, and needed to navigate a number of cities: for several business meetings and just to find our way around.

When DVDs came out I thought that CDs were gone.  I thought all bands would start making videos out of all their songs and selling DVDs instead of CDs.  That's what happened with records.  CDs came out and no one released vinyl anymore.  I am so glad that The Sun was the first band to do this.  Every song on this disk is golden.  There ain't a bad song in the bunch.  I heard about this disk on NPR radio.  It seems that it was taking Warner Bros. so long to release the CD that the band made homemade videos for all their songs.  The record company heard about this, watched the videos and said, that's cool, here is some more money, go and make the videos professionally and we will release it as a DVD, like it was a new idea or something.  I talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should have been done a long time ago.  Another thing that is way cool is the audio tracks.  All the songs are on the disk in .wav form too so that you can put it in your computer and tell Windows Media Player or whatever you use to put it on a regular CD and play it in your car or convert them into MP3s.  There is even a sticker on the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the .wav files. --- I could go on and on about how much I love this disk.  I played it for my wife, kids, coworkers and they all loved it.  Like other reviewers said, The Sun is a new classic.  Keep it up boys.	pos

You likely won't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very "messy" system. But it does have a great antivirus and firewall, and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on "behind the scenes", it's an okay product.

The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because I have only taken it on the road once, so as of yet I can't call it a worthy 'road warrior.' However, it is certainly a great case.

I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings.  I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy.  I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs.  Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games.  Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not.  In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy	neg

I was eager to read this book, but after reading it I was left completely flat.  The rest of the iceberg?  Hardly. ---  --- Smith barely gives us more than what we could get from reading Sports Illustrated, or any Minnesota sports page.  He admits he's not a fan of football, but for the majority of the book leisurely describes the most basic parts of his football career.   ---  --- This book is touted as: his full and complete story.  So we learned he was watching Ren & Stimpy during his NFL Draft.  Wow, are these the types of meaty stories that we want to read? ---  --- How about telling us more of the inside details...  How did Smith deal with people who wanted to be his friends or girlfriends only because he was a star football player?  Who were his friends that he could trust, and when did he need that trust?  What thoughts enter your mind as you look to hire an agent?  What was he doing when he was "goofing off and missing class all summer" which led to one of the most covered stories of his time at Ohio State?  When, and why did he begin using pot?  If football is not "smart" enough for him, why doesn't he study and break down some of the coaching process that is more mentally challenging?  What happened to plans for medical school?  We know the stories of football; those are the parts of the iceberg that have already been documented. ---  --- I also felt Smith wrote this book as if he is defending himself from all of America.  Who is attacking him?  Why does he feel the need to explain why he was paid so much?  Highly paid athlete stories are, sorry for the pun, a dime a dozen.  He tries to compare his sitting out for more money to a scenario for the average guy.  The truth is, many people will take a job for 5% less than a co-worker because yes, they value things other than money, and yes, they are happy to have a job.   ---  --- Leaving the grammatical errors to the other reviewers, it felt like I was reading an average high school creative writing project.  'I did this, I did that, I went to bed, next day.'  Half of his quotes are from the wellspring of deep philosophy: pop music.  Smith notes "less than 50 percent of Americans read at a 10th-grade level".  Well, this book certainly won't tax the reading ability of too many people. ---  --- One lesson from this book is that Smith had opportunities to swallow his pride, take some coaching, and come up with a better solution.  This book is another one of those times.  He should have hired an editor or writing consultant who could give guidance.  Build the characters; help us feel their stories.  Instead, Smith felt it necessary to go alone to get to the raw emotions.  Sorry, but compared to other autobiographies, this was not an emotional book. ---  --- I'm sure Smith is all the things that Mike Gutter says he is, such as: thoughtful, honest, trustworthy, dependable, passionate...  but I felt that some of the best stories that would demonstrate these characteristics were left out of this book.   ---  --- Instead, we are still looking for the rest of the iceberg.	neg

My daughter, 6, received this for Christmas. Her 4-year-old brother also  wanted to play with it. ---  --- The first problem is that there are NO INSTRUCTIONS included for how to put it together. This is a problem when you have two antsy kids eager to play with it. I was struggling with getting the various panels to snap together solidly when, after repeated attempts, I happened to look in the drawer underneath the colored bulbs and crayons, and found -- what do you know! -- screws. Then, after I put on the top, I realized I should have installed the light bulb first (you need a light bulb of 25 watts or less, not included). Then, when I thought I was done, I found I had a piece left over. Arrgh! ---  --- That extra piece was a clip that is supposed to hold a picture for tracing. Ha! Even after I installed it, there's no tension on the clip and very little chance that it will hold anything. ---  --- There are two drawers to hold the bulbs and crayons. Good idea. But for some reason the drawers catch and stick. How hard can it be to make drawers that slide easily in and out? --- 	neg
Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor	neg
This story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing. It clearly establishes a sense of time and place (modern day Madison, Wisconsin) and offers the "promise" of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) from the perspective of a personal caregiver. While we learn to understand the struggles of the patient, Kate, this is more about the struggles of a college student known as "Bec," as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own. Author, Michelle Wildgen, fulfills the promise. ---  --- This story is character-driven, and what made me turn the pages wasn't the story, which was, at times, a bit slow and uninspiring. With the exception of the "blue butterfly," the additional sex scenes felt extraneous. Further, one can guess from the beginning that in terms of Kate's condition, there wouldn't be a `happy' ending. Regardless, Wildgen paints a very realistic picture of ALS, and definitely puts you in the room. What made me turn the pages was Wildgen's ability to make each of her characters come alive. I cared about them and wanted to see how they'd handle Kate's progressive and ultimate demise. ---  --- Bec is the narrator who learns as she goes (both how to take care of Kate and how to cook for her guests/staff/family). We see everything through her eyes, particularly as she becomes Kate's voice. The title, "You're Not You," comes from Kate, as she asks Bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation. The secondary characters are also well developed, including Kate's husband, Evan, Bec's roommate, Jill, and to a lesser degree, Bec's lover, Liam. Liam, a married faculty member, represents another dimension of Bec's floundering, and her search to, in a sense, pick a major. Ultimately, the story becomes a vehicle for Bec's eventual direction of career choice. ---  --- I recommend as a thought provoking read, and for the strong writing and character development. Additionally, if you know (or have known) someone with ALS, I believe you'll appreciate the author's knowledge and sensitivity. ---  --- From the author of "A Line Between Friends," McKenna Publishing Group	pos
After watching Anastasia do eye brows on TV i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows.  After receiving this kit, i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself.  Holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves.  I do however shape my daughters brows.  In conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person. 	pos
I knew I wanted a bowflex and couldn't decide between the models available.  This model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my "spare/exercise" room for a weekend guest.  --- This product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team (A husband/wife team worked for us).  --- This is the first exercise equipment I have been consistent with.  It is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets.  I also have the Ab attachment.  Love it	pos
I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn.  I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse.  Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it.  Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick.  My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath.  The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it.  I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out.  Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated.  Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40.  So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-	neg
I was very disappointed that the version of "Paper Roses" included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated "Paper Roses.&quot	neg

I recently purchased this for use with my 550EX. If you use alot of flash for event photography, you will want this in your kit. It is expensive, but I think it is worth every penny. It will keep you from changing AAs in your strobe and it quickens the recycle times to nearly instant. You can shoot bursts and still get the proper flash exposure. You can attach a strap to sling it over your shoulder or slip it on your belt. Mounting on my 20D was just not comfortable. It gets in the way of the hand-grip	pos
[Below is my recent review of the JVC Everio GZ-MG40, which has a 20GB hard drive rather than 30GB. Becase GZ-MG50 seems to be identical to GZ-MG40 save the hard drive capacity, I thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy GZ-MG50.] ---  ---  --- ---------------------------------------- ---  --- I have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now. And here are my impressions: ---  --- PROS: ---  --- A) This is a tiny camcorder and I can easily carry it in my pocket everyday. ---  --- B) It records directly on a [30GB] harddrive. This is probably the most amazing feature of this camera. It has the following amazing benefits:  ---     (1) A huge recording space  ---     (2) Random access to recorded videos when browsing  ---        (through a thumblist of videos)  ---     (3) Super fast transfer onto your computer through USB 2.0.  ---     (4) No tapes, no CDs, no DVDs to worry about while recording video. ---     (5) Facilitates easy archiving/organizing . For example, all the recorded files on the camera's harddrive have  "creation date"s as a part of their file information. When the camera is connected to your computer, you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging. (This is extra, but if you want to index and be able to search your video files, say with google desktop, simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file.)  ---     (6) The harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media- this is unlikely but If you wanted you could even install linux on it and  carry with you an operating system on your camera. ---  --- C) Video quality is good for a consumer level video camera. The sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good: i can hear the lectures I record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera. ---  --- D) The charger that comes with this camera is very small. So you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery. ---  ---  --- CONS: ---  --- A) No mic jacks. --- B) manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus. --- C) The editing software that comes with it is  limited. --- D) The battery life is a mere hour(but you can buy a 3 hour battery for 70-80 dollars). ---  ---  --- As with all camcorders, the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera. It produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations. ---  --- The video files recorded by this camera have a ".MOD" extension in their name. I replace ".MOD" with  ".MPG" and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files	pos

You could get the same info on "percentage" of body fat by going online. Think about it: how does a scale "measure" your body fat? Good question. So I went to the website of the manufacturer and...surprise, surprise...there were no details about HOW this worked. It did, however, note what it was SUPPOSED to detect and how that might connect to body fat.   ---  --- The scale supposedly measures something called "electrical impedence" which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all that hard to understand. All it means is that the more fat you have in your body, the more "impedence" you have and the higher the body fat reading. Electricity doesn't flow as well through fat and the scale is supposed to detect that.  ---  --- BUT HERE IS THE CATCH - getting an ACCURATE body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just stepping on a scale, especially if the consumer (buyer) of that scale doesn't understand the factors that are VITAL to an accurate measurement. What you have in your body when you step ON the scale is one vital factor.  ---  ---  --- Here is just one example of how easy it would be to get a bad reading: ---  If you are dehydrated from not drinking enough water or, conversely, you are OVERhydrated from drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body fat within a certain amount of time AFTER exercise or you've been standing too long or you've eaten recently.....you are very likely to get an inaccurate reading and you'll be confused by the variation in readings from one day to the next, not knowing WHAT factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading. Even worse, you'll have no real idea of your body fat. ---  --- From what I've seen, these scales do provide accurate weight measurements.But when it comes to measuring body fat,the ads or website do not seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you step on the scale at the wrong time of day, too soon after exercising, if you are thirsty, etc. ---  --- So save your money.  If you are working out regularly, eating right, getting in shape, etc....odds are that your body fat is dropping and you'll see signs of this. You don't need this scale to prove it (although you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat some other way).  ---  --- Signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles, looser clothes and (often) a more streamlined figure. Your metabolism is likely to be more efficient, assuming you don't overeat too much. If you absolutely HAVE to know your percentage of body fat, just ask your local physician, trainer or gym director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so. If you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level, your body fat should go down, assuming you don't compensate by eating too much.  ---  --- So don't count on this scale to give you the consistency or quality of a detailed and CONTROLLED body fat measurement. It won't.  	neg

I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.	neg

Although this book is only 20 pages long, it contains helpful information about the concept of fair trade.  Americans have so much, and it is hard for us to imagine the degree of poverty in other third-world countries.  Rose Ericson begins to introduce the subject of what fair trade means to these nations.  To us it is only a $1 sometimes, but that $1 in a poor nation can supply food for a day to an entire family.  In our hurry to accumulate material goods, we must be careful to not take advantage of the artisans and producers of these third-world nations.  Fair trade is a concept whose time has come	pos
Sometimes, debut albums present an artist in full bloom, with an assured grasp on their sound and message. Sometimes, debut albums are nothing but promise, pointing toward what the artist could do. Public Enemy's gripping first album, Yo! Bum Rush the Show, manages to fill both categories: it's an expert, fully realized record of extraordinary power, but it pales in comparison with what came merely a year later. This is very much a Rick Rubin-directed production, kicking heavy guitars toward the front, honing the loops, rhythms, and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap. But, damn if they don't sound like they've already conquered the world! Already, there is a tangible, physical excitement to the music, something that hits the gut with relentless force, as the mind races to keep up with Chuck's relentless rhymes or Flavor Flav's spastic outbursts. And if there doesn't seem to be as many classics here -- "You're Gonna Get Yours," "Miuzi Weighs a Ton," "Public Enemy No. 1" -- that's only in comparison to what came later, since by any other artist an album this furious, visceral, and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic. From Public Enemy, this is simply a shade under classic status	pos

In locker rooms and office corridors across this nations, a battle rages for the souls of men. Perhaps only the fratricidal dispute between boxers and briefs has more violently bloodied the masculine nose of our generation than this battle. Yet the jury remains out: wallet or money clip, what'll it be? ---  --- Lives and careers are savaged by a choice of one over the other, yet the passion that drives guys in the direction of the traditonal leather wallet or - alternatively - to the minimalist money clip continues unabated. ---  --- The Titanium Money Clip scores a victory for the latter. Small, lightweight, attractive, it cleans a hip pocket out, straightens the hang of the trouser, and facilitates the quick snatch of a bill when the wallet guys are still sorting through receipt they carelessly shoved in with their banknotes. ---  --- The only complaint regarding this product is that it requires five or six bills, minimum, before it has a sufficient wad to clasp firmly. ---  --- Other than that ... well ... I can't even remember where I tossed my wallet	pos
I bought this tire gauge specifically to check the tire pressure of my F350 dually.  The factory installed steel extenders made using pencil type gauges or other digital gauges impractical, particularly for checking the inner and outer rear tires.  Even though this gauge is sold for 'dual rear wheel trucks', I had to bend the steel tube about 5 degrees so it could make solid contact with the inner tire inflation stem.  Once it was bent, the gauge worked perfectly!  NOTE: I had friends at a machine shop bend the steel tube for me, it was too stiff to bend by hand or in a vice.  The gauge has big digits that are easy to read, even without my cheater glasses.  The air release button on the handle is convienent to use - even though I first thought it was for the display.  I have found it best to test the pressure, add more air than needed and then slowly release it using a combination of the button and disengaging and reengaging the gauge and testing until you get the desired tire pressure.  I found that if I failed to disengage and then reengage the tire pressure gauge, it tended to give me the same reading without resetting.  The guys at the garages always 'OHHHH and AHHHH' when I open the case and pull out this impressive tool.  It was well worth the money and Amazon had the best price of the various sites I visited while price shopping.  Oh, yea, I had to cut the plastic case a tad to allow for the bent tube to properly fit in the case so it would close	pos

After reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby, I was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance.  Let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded. ---  --- Yes, if you film in very low light, it will darken many colors.  But we're talking 60 lux, which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake.  Just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles, and viola!  Seriously, I have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors, outdoors, or even when I film local bands playing in dark bars. ---  --- The reason I wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews.  I do not want a tape mechanism that will break, nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions (think snow skiing, as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather).   ---  --- As I said, I was skeptical when I purchased it, but no more.  The videos are far better than any other camcorder I've owned.  My last was a Canon ZR 50 mini DV, and this camera takes VASTLY superior videos than that one. ---  --- The four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to.  I have a mac, so editting requires that I convert to DV with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies.  Mainly, I just don't edit my home videos so that hasn't been a problem.  But if would have been nice for it to be an easier option, and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3/aac, which appears to be the next standard.   ---  --- If that concerns you, or if you want HD, you might wait until the Panasonic SD1 is available because it records in AVHDC which is a form of mpeg4.  Of course, imovie doesn't yet support that either, so you may have to wait until iLife 07 to really use it.   ---  --- In parting, I will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous.  I no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini DV camera.  This thing literally fits in my jacket pocket, so I end up filming a lot more than I did with previous cameras.  If you're looking for small, flash-based, and good quality video, get this camera, you'll love it	pos
As a complete newbie to XML this was a good starter.  As I got deeper into XML I found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  For instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD element content definition is flat out wrong.  His description of Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  He makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  I have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of XML information	neg

I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes.  Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months.  I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months.  I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time.  The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it.  She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash.  I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is!  It is so soft and cuddly.  We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy.  Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic.  We love it!	pos

I am a latecomer to the works of Chopin, unqualified to comment on Dinu Lipatti's technique and interpretation, but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes. They are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication, but on this disc Lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising. There are four waltzes in the key of A flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital. Contrast this to Alexandre Thaurad's CD where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups. (He also adds five more posthumous works.) ---  --- Most of Chopin's waltzes start on the dominant, meaning either the fifth note of the home key (the tonic, the I), or a dominant seventh chord (V7) which leads to the tonic. Lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle. If, for instance, there were a waltz that ended on a C natural it could easily bring us to Waltz No 4, which starts on an insistent C7 chord before rising to the home key of F major. I will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this CD. ---  --- Track 1: Waltz No 4 in F, "Grande Valse brillante" - as noted starts on the V7 and finishes on F in octaves. ---  --- Track 2: No 5 in A flat - begins on a trilling dominant Eb, but the note it trills up to is an F (which ended the previous track). Finishes with a parting shot, a turn in the bass ending on Ab. ---  --- Track 3: No 6 in D flat, "Minute Waltz" - starts on Ab; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well. Ends in Db. ---  --- Track 4: No 9 in A flat - has two pick up notes then hits a Db on the downbeat of the first measure. The right hand ends on the Ab above middle C. ---  --- Track 5: No 7 in C sharp minor - starts on a G sharp above middle C, which is the same black key (enharmonic equivalent) of the previous Ab. Ends in C# minor. ---  --- Track 6: No 11 in G flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a Db (enharmonic C#). Ends on a Gb in the treble clef. ---  --- Track 7: No 10 in B minor - starts quietly on the same note, an F# (enharmonic Gb). Ends with a soft B in the bass clef. ---  --- Track 8: No 14 in E minor - first note is the exact same B in the bass. Ends in E minor. ---  --- Track 9: No 3 in A minor - starts on an E in the bass melody. Ends in A minor; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a C natural -- you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure. ---  --- Track 10: No 8 in A flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys, but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz. Instead of starting on the dominant, this one begins on the major third -- C natural. ---  --- Track 11: No 12 in F minor - starts on the dominant -- C again. Toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch. Instead of ending in F minor this waltz closes in the relative major of Ab. The last three notes are a rise and fall, Bb-C-Ab. ---  --- Track 12: No 13 in D flat - there is a leading note before the dominant. The first three notes (Bb-Ab-F) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous. Ends quietly in Db. ---  --- Track 13: No 1 in E flat, "Valse brillante" - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection. If you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note, a Bb -- quietly in the former, boldly here. Finishes resoundingly in the tonic Eb. ---  --- Track 14: No 2 in A flat, "Grande Valse brillante" - introduction in the dominant chord, Eb7. Closes in Ab. From here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again, linking the major third (C natural) to the V7 that starts the F major waltz	pos
This grill cover is much nicer than the Weber standard cover.  I have the 18 1/2" and can't imagine that the 22 1/2" is much different.  What I really like is the elastic pieces sown to the bottom that keep it on snuggly even when a little wind is blowing.   ---  --- Again, it looks nice, all black, stitching virtually invisible, and a nice Weber logo. ---  --- After a couple nights left in the rain, the grill shows zero signs of being out in the weather	pos

I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?	neg
It starts out like Laura Bush's Rules for Driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old Laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!   ---  --- My interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about Laura Bush	neg
This was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It didn't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters. The plot and scripting are  incredibly weak, it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the  credits there. The CGI dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their  animation was very stiff. In my opinion, not worth the $83 it costs	neg
I'm a fan of Three 6 Mafia, and I can say maybe they kinda got a little of Three 6's rap style in this album, but I dunno. ---  --- DJ Paul and Juicy J, the superproducers, they can never be beaten. I got all the Hypnotize Minds albums and they did invent crunk music. Many people haven't heard of them cuz besides Ridin' Spinners and Chickenhead they haven't been played on the radio very much except for their new track "Poppin' My Collar." ---  --- Crime Mob's alright. The beats are alright, but nothing compared to Three 6 Mafia. Some of them are some krunk songs, I can get hyped to a few of them. But other than that I dunno. The lyrics are rather simple, I'm an 18 year old white dude and I think I can put together some better bars than these dudes can. ---  --- But they do get some major play up here in Virginia. Stilletos and Knuck if you Buck haven't gotten some airtime. But there's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing. I guess we'll see if they put out another album or not. I think if they had some other fellas from Georgia like T.I. or Jeezy or something they might get some more hype. Who knows, since Paul Wall's on every song now maybe he'll make a cameo. I guess we'll see. ---  --- Three 6 Mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist Chrome, who really is garbage, they are still the kings of crunk, not Lil' John	pos

This camera was great at first and very easy to use, however, the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well.  When we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture, so we put it in our cedar chest (we keep our house very dry and don't live in a humid area - Nebraska).  This worked for a few months, but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless.  I wish it was different, but bottom line, this is a disposable video camera - a nice one, but still disposable	neg
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.	neg
I think its safe to say that this game sucks! Before I got this game I thought it would be great. I had heard so many good things about it. Once I got it though I realized that this game wasnt as great as everyone said it would be. The Graphics are ok but the gameplay and sound dont impress me at all. Plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes. As for all the talk about you being able to use the force the force is pretty weak in this game. You also dont get the force until level 7 and on some of the missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning, push, pull, ect. Really the only good force power is grip.(Grip allows you to choke people)Another thing that sucks is that there are different powers of the force so when you finally get the force you have to build up your power of the force for a few levels (wich could take hours) to finally get your force power strong enough to kill the enemy, not just wound him. This game is also EXTREAMLY hard. Its like Metroid Prime were you can get lost and it'll take a long time to find your way around. If you still want to get this game after reading this review is suggest renting it first.(Dont Be Dumb like me and buy it without renting it. I wasted $50	pos
Very, very happy with this appliance.  I was a bit sceptical before ordering when I read about `stamped metal' but when it arrived, yes it's stamped metal (not every component is, though), but very heavy gauge metal and very well engineered.  I used it immediately after I received it and WOW!  Talk about the `dragon`s breath!'  Very high BTU's and the food cooked like I never have experienced.  Finally, authentic oriental cooking at home.  Highly recommended. --- UPDATE:  Well, I've been using this for quite a long time now and I am even more pleased than ever.  I remember asking a Chinese chef in China town how come I can't make food like this at home.  He stated (in a heavy Oriental dialect), "You gotta use hot wok.  Wok gotta be very, very hot!"  Yep, that's the secret.  You will never replicate authentic Oriental cooking on an ordinary gas or electric stove.  "You gotta use hot wok!!" and this devise puts out the BTUs for a very "hot wok" indeed	pos
This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors.

Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!  I'm only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt; cut lower than other V-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out!  If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is!  Honestly, I probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home, but I still love it	pos
Wow! I was totally surprised at how nice this instrument was when it arrived! I thought at such a low price it would be a low-quality trumpet, but its really absolutely perfect for my first-time trumpeter daughter. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this.

The Firms "Super Body Sculpt" is a 40 mins, 3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body, and Abs.  Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete total body workout.  The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups, lat rows and french presses and biceps.  The Lower Body section focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last leg press exercise, there are more squats  that will make you want to scream "Enough".  I found the Abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques.  The stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my favourite.  Overall it is very well instructed.  You can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg presses and squats.  I usually do all three segments to get the full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool to a firm body	pos
I bought the first mattress topper for myself and my husband.  After the first night I knew I wanted one to put in our RV too.  My husband complained about the smell when I unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in years.  He had me order one for his sister for Christmas. I thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so now I have purchased four!  This is a wonderful product.  I would recommend it to anyone	pos

...that you simply HAVE to see, "Mrs Miniver" being one, a little known film dealing with a fictitious German invasion to a sweet English Village, "Went the day well?" and this film. ---  Why so? Because all 3 were made at the start of the war (early 40's) when England stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt Hitler and aggresive facism. Invasion fears were rife, the war effort looked hopeless at times as in Europe, Hitler opposing country after country fell to the German aggressors (not to mention the rampage going on in Africa at the hands of Rommel  aided by the Italian forces under Mussolini's instruction).  England's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed, starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day. It was quite possibly the darkest of times in English History and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect, with realistic perfection. In which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly, inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of British life. ---  For a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made (1942), and I guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely Coward's plan. ---  An absolute gem and a must see, I weep every time I watch it	pos
I was looking to get the DVD of DAZED AND CONFUSED but got the CD. When it was advertised on the AMAZON website it led me to believe that it was a DVD as you see it above. (1993 Film) I had to return it and my expense. Very disappointing transaction with AMAZON. Threfore, i am not impressed	neg
I've had this for about a month, and I've used it less than 6 times. --- Even though I've carefully handwashed it, and merely wiped off the ice ring, the ice ring has sprung a leak (ewww, blue liquid on my celery!!). --- The lid is difficult to snap on/remove. --- The center container/lid is really too tall for its diameter, which makes using it for dipping rather awkward	neg
I got this puzzle for my three children (age 5, 4, and 2) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked.

The pieces are small enough that I wasn't very worried about choking, but why buy a toy which makes you worry?  We were really disappointed.  	neg
I could never expect to like a lemon scented perfume,but this one is definately different. ---  --- When i first smelt it in the bottle i thought:"Oh,no!Dish soap!",but when i put it on i immediately loved it. ---  --- On me it smells like lemon scented candy.It's so fresh and clean!I couldn't stop smelling my wrist!And everytime i smelt it i felt as if i were in a wet garden and lemon blossoms were falling on my skin! ---  --- It was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes. --- It lasts a long time too and it's affordable,plus it smells like spring! ---  --- The best choise to welcome the hot days of the summer,since it will keep you fresh and cool. ---  --- A must buy!	pos

The writing was not what I expect of Andre Norton. Too many gaps and information that is disjointed. Whether this is a consequence of collaboration I don't know. I felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened. For example - at the start we know Kirion has sent people to capture his sister. The book covers over 2 years, but you hardly hear of this again. I cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop. --- I am a long-time fan and retired children's librarian. Sic Fi & fantasy is my favorite genre, but this one I had to push to finish. Unsatisfying. --- 	neg
I was extremely disappointed in this "upgrade".  I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it.  That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort.  Almost everything was intuitive. ---  --- Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility.  So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what?  The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts.  Arranging music is not as easy as it was before.  And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother. ---  --- In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing! ---  --- Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works.  I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money).  I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio	neg
I tried Pure Bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website. The site waxed poetic about the flavor, as well as the extremely high quality ingredients, but I figured "right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are". Well, I stand corrected, the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted (and I've tasted quite a few). That's a real bonus, considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. To those unfamiliar with raw food bars, take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like "granola" bars or candy bars, you'll be disappointed. Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. I can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. On to the chocolate next...	pos

If you are interested in knowing what challenges monarches and other powerful people face, this movie is a great beginning. You may or may not be interested in Russian history or even world history, but this particular story greatly encapsulates the emotional, physical and political issues faced by two powerfully-born adults and their children. Other reviews at this site are terrific for their critical perceptions of this movie and its strengths and weaknesses, so I will not go into too much detail to "sell" anybody on the action or dialogue, or historical accuracy. Suffice to say this movie -- in its unedited version (crucial for DVD) does in fact tell it like it is (or was). Nicholas and Alexandra were two human beings who happened to be born into the Western dynastic system still prevalent at the turn of the 20th century. They were responsible, in an almost Biblical sense, for the destiny of Humanity, only they opted out, and were then executed. This would be considered "romantic" if Humanity did not have such an overwhelming need for Leadership by designated heroes. The DVD version is critical to see the full relationship between Alexandria and Rasputin as a surrendering of power, and also to see Rasputin in his full decadent expression (which must be positively repulsive to Russian history revisionists.) It is also necessary, in an emotional and historic context, to see the "failure" of Nicholas -- that he could no longer carry the responsibility of the godhead. It is also relevant to see the execution of Rasputin at the hands of the two hop-head fairies who were also in line to inherit this godhead, and that they themselves had dreams of American incorporation. Alexia (Nicholas and Alexandra's only son, who also happened to be a hemophiliac) hates his persecutors with a very personal, adult hatred -- those who persecuted the Romanov dynasty were people who hated themselves and took that hatred out on the leaders they loved and despised. They loved their leaders, and despised their need for leaders. If you purchase this movie, whatever your reason or interest, please buy the DVD so that it is unedited (meaning uncensored) so thatyou may judge for yourself	pos
I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;	neg
This book describes the eleven-year psychotherapy process for a woman with sixteen different personalities.  The analysis process took place from 1954 through 1965.  Sybil, the subject of the book, was a child of the 1920's and 30's, and her multiple-personality disease was a result of her family's genetic history and her fundamentalist, repressed, and abusive upbringing.  Much of Sybil's struggles were due to the time period in which she lived--her family had mental illness but felt that ignoring it and focusing on other pursuits was the best course of action.  She was so denied the exploration of her feelings that she choked back all symptoms of mental illness and tried to act normal, hindering her recovery for years. ---  --- I am still in shock over the patience and dedication that was required to work with the frustratingly different personalities over a period of eleven years!  I got frustrated at the slow and relapse-prone re-integration process at the end of the book, and I admire Schreiber for painstakingly recounting the process instead of using Hollywood-style short-cuts.  Sybil's recovery and emergence as a complete, functional woman in her forties was a very hard-won victory. ---  --- During the revealing of Sybil's personalities, I really liked Vicky.  She was the all-seeing personality who know the lineage of all others.  I liked her better than I liked the backbone-less Sybil, and I wanted her to exist for this lost woman.  During the personality-integration process, I learned that all of the personalities were a part of Sybil, and such exaggerated emotion as Vicky's had to be integrated in to part of the whole Sybil. ---  --- Overall, this is an amazing book that well stands the test of time.	pos

What a pile of junk.  Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture.  If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess.  Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark.  And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing.  I can't believe they sell this thing.	neg
I found the first book, Faerie Wars, pretty interesting so I decided to read this one. In many ways it had excellent qualities such as suspense, mystery and a bit of romance. I'll have to admit, I finished the book pretty quickly because I got hooked onto it and didn't want to put it down. There were many twists and turns of the plot, and it was practically impossible to guess what would happen next at times. --- I did, however, find the ending a tad abrupt. It was such a shame to finish the book without any more information on Pyrgus, Mr. Fogarty, Henry or Blue. But overall the book was an excellent one..... it will certainly capture your interest	pos

This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers.  The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break.  The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing.  It is like the oil in the compass is very thin.  Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading.  Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well. ---  ---  --- If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva.  For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement	neg

Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory.

Nero 6 is a wonderful product, but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version, not an OEM CD or a CD of questionable origin. At this time (April 2006) the best place to get it is from the Ahead Software website (the makers of Nero). (You can get a retail box of Nero 7 just about anywhere, but Nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need.) You can download a demo, then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product. It's a smooth, easy transaction. After many headaches I discovered that the OEM version that came with my DVD burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder, but wouldn't let me burn them to DVDs. My choice was to either buy a CD of questionable origin (and one that is almost certifiably illegal) on eBay, purchase a DVD burning plug-in from Ahead Software for $24.99, or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. I chose the latter. Using my installed OEM version, I purchased the serial number, entered it into the product (very easy to do), then downloaded the latest updates, and I was off and running. This software produces very high quality DVDs and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x NEC DVD burner. I am now a happy consumer with a stack of DVDs containing transferred videos of great quality	pos

I really wanted to see how the developers could represent playing as a dragon, and spyro is the only one that came to mind at the time.  I decided to get it, I put it in my console, turned it on, and was blown away...by the stupidity. ---  --- -Basic Story --- Is stupid.  Bad dragon plant mean gems to kill good dragon.  Spyro good dragon, defeat evil dragon.  Everybody dances because goodness prevailes. ---  --- -Gameplay --- An atrocious story can be overlooked if the gameplay is good (mario?) but spyro has probably the worst gameplay ever.  It combines horrible, precise jumping puzzles with abysmally stupid enemies.  The puzzles require you to tap the jump button at a certain time.  If you don't, you go back to the beginning of the puzzle.  It was maddeningly hard at some points, and I am grown.  So how hard would it be for a kid? ---  --- For the enemies, they should get the darwin award.  At many instances I was breathing flame (it has a limited reach) and the enemy walked right into it!  The enemies are dumber then a retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than Paris Hilton.  Also, they are very weak dying in 1-2 hits.  There are also very few types of enemies (like around 2-6) but they have the same AI and equally pose no challenge, seeing as they are weak and attack you one at a time. --- The boss battles are so simple they make you want to shoot yourself at how moronic they are.  Also, playing as the other characters (hunter, blinx etc.) are not that fun. ---  --- In conclusion don't make the mistake I made and steer clear of this game.  Get better ones for yourself whomever you are giving a gift to.  ---  --- (Oh, and don't listen to the other people who gave this crudhole good reviews, they are either A. Retarded or B.

This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do.  I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is.  A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile.  The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands.  One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side. 	pos

American Heritage is a fine magazine brought to us by the same publishers who bring us Forbes Magazine. It is a magazine that examines history in all shapes and forms, examining past events and cultural changes that have shaped the American nation.  ---  --- One thing about this magazine that you will notice right away is that it is not just a magazine about American political history or the type of history that you remember from your school days. It does talk about this type of history, but it also includes stories about music, art, and other topics, breaking them apart and explaining how and why things happened the way they did and how they compare to the present. It also points out facts from the past that are more obscure, making for some very stimulating reading.  ---  --- Current events are also covered in this magazine, and in these instances, American Heritage discusses present- day phenomena from an intellectual and critical standpoint, often comparing it to similar events in the American past. This helps to keep the magazine current and more in- tune with important issues of the day.   ---  --- History buffs will love this magazine, and so will those of an intellectual persuasion. The articles here are more thoughtful than other magazines and many of them require greater concentration. For these reasons, American Heritage is not really a casual reading type of publication. It is intended for those who like to read, think, discuss, and debate. It's one of my favorite magazines of its kind on the market today.  --- 	pos
This film released in late 1984,is about a married man named Rob Salinger(the late Dudley Moore) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage. Rob is a newspaper editor married to Micheline "Micki" Salinger(Ann Reinking),a judge. While secretly romancing Maude(Amy Irving),he proposes to her(Maude). Rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes,they(the women) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages. But Rob keeps both wives. In the real world,bigamy is undoubtedly illegal. Director Blake Edwards' previous film credits include BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and THE PINK PANTHER. Subsequently,he directed the late John Ritter in 1989's SKIN DEEP	pos

I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a "new account" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750	neg

After an elaborate theft scheme at the Cannes film festival goes terribly wrong Rebecca Romijn Ex-Stamos must go into hiding.She assumes a new identity but 7 years later a photographer threatens to expose her unless she can outwit him.Full of twists,deceit and secrets where nothing is as it seems don't expect a  plot or memorable performances.Rebecca is incredibly sexy but along with the rest of the cast she's just a pawn in DePalma's clever mindbender.A huge Hitchcock fan DePalma is best at stylish suspense scenes with no dialogue(like the 15 minute opening scene at the Cannes film festival in this film)and nicely includes elements of his and Hitchcock's previous films from Vertigo to Dressed to Kill.It's a lot of fun spotting the cinematic references and on repeated viewings you'll notice plenty of sneaky touches.If you're looking for an actionpacked straightforward suspense film you won't like Femme Fatale.If however you're looking for a twisty challenging film Femme Fatale will reward your attention	pos
This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil.  Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to.  A food should taste like what it is!  ---  --- The nutritional value of this food is outstanding.  It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial.  It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils.  It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).   ---  --- My Suggested Uses:  smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair. 	pos
Although a couple of reviews said this was a great product, I was wary as I have never found anything that actually worked.  I have a job where my mind is always on the go, and often have a week or two a month where I just can't get to sleep. ---  --- The CD arrived during one of these times, I put it on my portable CD player not expecting too much, and almost imediately felt a bit queazy, nothing too bad, and on later research this basically proves the Delta wave theory Dr. Thompson is working. ---  --- The only time in the past when I have gone to sleep so easily when I have been out partying all night when I was younger.  I play the CD on a stereo I have in my room, and I rarely wake up at all. ---  --- I am certainly going to buy more of his CD's	pos
Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step  for a year now & damn if I can get the thing off !!!  We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquid --- everything short of cutting the thing off. The key  (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.   ---  --- Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them.  My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it & today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way.  ---  --- Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK  Brand.	neg
I bought this clock last week.  --- Amazon was prompt in shipping it on time. --- On having received it I place the AA battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast. It is actually searching for the signal. If it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in 5 minutes.  --- If not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server. The clock finds the time signal within the next 4-5 hours. The chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion.  ---  --- Once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind.  ---  --- A very good time piece	pos

My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light. ---  --- I received the Tranquility Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks, too.  ---  --- I've given this 5 stars because there's no option for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades. ---  --- Even with these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it, too	pos

Peter Dinklage may be the one of the most unlikely sex symbols ever to assay the role of A Stranger Comes To Town, but that's part of what makes this charming character study so offbeat and unforgettable.  As Finn, a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in Newfoundland, NJ, Dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back, never begging the audience's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger, hurt, bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes.  (His rumbly, seductive voice doesn't hurt either.)  As a local resident with a tragic past, Patricia Clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters (and provides some of the film's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her SUV), with stellar support from a garrulous Bobby Cannavale and a luminous Michelle Williams.  Settle into the film's gracious, generous rhythms and prepare to feel absolutely wonderful	pos
 --- While Bumble and Bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products, this conditioner (and I might add shampoo by the same name) was a real disappointment.  ---  --- Using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there wasn't even a pleasant scent.

FROM AMAZON.CA --- --------- ---  --- The Action Replay MAX is more than just a video game enhancer (VGE)....or at least it claims to be. My version is quite old yet but it claims to include a Region-free DVD player and a memory card compression utility (squeeze more saves onto your memory card). I have not used either of these features personally, but I have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards; some reusable, some permanently damaged. This and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it. However, the real reason I bought the ARMax was for its codes and I'll get to those in a second. ---  --- The ARMax, like the newer Gamesharks, loads its software from a CD. This is a major annoyance for me. Every time you load a game you must insert the ARMax memory card (which does I don't know what) and CD, go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load, choose your codes, then get up and put the actual game DVD in and wait for it to load. You can't simply turn on your PS2 and go sit down. In the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the VGE between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down. The early generation Gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the PS1 or N64 and that was it. If you wanted it to load before the game, you turned on its switch. Even if the ARMax was perfect in every other way (and it's not, btw), it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a CD first. I mean, why can't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don't have to load the software EVERY D@MN TIME. ---  --- Ok, rant over. On to the codes. The user interface for the ARMax is better than the Gameshark. Functionally, they are very similar of course, but the ARMax just feels cleaner and easier to use. It offers a Beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions (not for user-entered ones though, if I remember right), and a more robust Expert Mode. On big advantage, in theory, that the ARMax has over the Gameshark is its ability to update itself using your PS2's broadband connection. The upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller. The dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download; its all or nothing. And since these updates are stored on your memory card (not the ARMax one), it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99% of which you will NEVER play! No wonder the ARMax has the option to come with 16 or 32MB of space on its memory card. It's to store all the useless codes! Any entered codes you choose to apply will either work, do nothing, or lock up the game. I have come across all, though to ARMax's credit, mostly the former. The absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the PS2 library, when you may want just one, loses the ARMax another star. A note about manually entering codes: The sub-headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game's code list. ---  --- Finally, as mentioned in the reviews by Bret Morris and Glenn Nichols (Amazon.ca), the ARMax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat PS2 a couple years ago AT ALL. This happened for me as well. I returned three PS2s and two ARMaxes before I realized it was a defect in all current versions (at the time) of ARMax. I had to send away and get a new disc direct from Intec which now works as well as expected. Since the ARMax has been on shelves for several years since I bought mine, I assume any bought today would not have this problem. However, at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting Intec personally. Retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the CodeJunkies web site. This inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops ARMax down to two stars. ---  --- In my opinion, if you're in the market for a VGE, both ARMax and Gameshark have their pros and cons. I would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones I have. Looks at the specs, assume nothing, and don't be afraid to e-mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about. ---  --- I apologize for the length of this review, but I find there are very few in-depth reviews of VGEs on the web or in print. Maybe reviewers feel they are above using VGEs, I don't know.	neg

It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the HBCU experience, period. Just look at "A Different World" and how bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe) stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed. So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin. I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND "School Daze", but you had to have attended one to get the real "flavor" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind. ---  --- Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call "dirty laundry" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that getting an education makes you "white", and so on), but those things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no "good" people or bad people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town, school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and bullying), and both of them had legitimate points.  ---  --- One thing Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more "destroying from within" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when confronted, even with solid proof. ("I would NEVER spread rumors about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!") Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on, whether that person is the school president, captain of the football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't matter. Your "status" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a friend who saw SD and said "That is SO unrealistic! Since when do college kids go fighting with each other all the time?" She graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said. ---  --- I'm so grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU students for those who think that all young black people do is have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs because they can't get into a "real" college. I wouldn't trade my experience at Florida A&M University for a degree at any PWC. RATTLERS	pos
Abel's Island is about a mouse named Abel.  He encounters a hurricane that separates him from his wife.  After the storm, he ends up on an island where he cannot escape because of the current surrounding the island.  He tries many ways to return to the place he loves, but all fail.  About a year after countless attempts to leave the island, a frog appears by accident. Gover, the frog, becomes friends with Abel and says he will come back with people to help Abel.  Abel's plans to return were very interesting.  His methods were very creative so it held my attention.  My favorite part was when he was fighting the owl.  I found a similarity between Abel and Stuart Little. Both had to navigate water. Stuart little was successful, but was Abel?  Read the book to find out.  	pos

I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago, and it's still in perfect condition!  The color doesn't fade when you wash it, and it's the most durable bag I've ever owned.  I will not, refuse to, absolutely cannot make me carry a purse, but I carry this bag everyday.  The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The "backpack straps" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!  Before, the selection was red and black only, so this is fabulous!  Buy this bag, you will love it	pos
I couldn't read past the second chapter.  Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims.  It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of "The Bitter".  "Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran.  I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed "other" type of woman, thanks. --- 	neg
I received this game as a gift and it really is a great! The book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'Cliff Notes' for the Art History classes I had in school.

this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it	pos
I'm an AFL fan and have been for a while, so I got this game, since it sounded interesting. It's not the truest sim out there, it's more like NFL Blitz but indoors. Still, it's a very fun game if you remember the 2000 AFL season. I would have liked to seen more of these games, for each season. At least this game will satisfy my appetite for AFL football. I would suggest all AFL fans to get this game, simply for the joy it will bring to you, and the fact that this is the only repesentation of the best brand of football out there. I just wish other smaller leagues (like the WNBA) would get a contract for games, since there are many fans of these lesser known sports that would love to have sim games. GO RATTLERS GO PRED	pos
This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. I even find myself checking my "mirror" when I'm walking and don't have it on. One drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. But that hasn't really been an issue for us. ---  --- Give these easy to use mirrors a try. I won't ride without one	pos
I have been using mascara since I was a teenager and this is absolutely the best ever. Ocassionally I have read reviews about other 'fantastic' mascaras and strayed and tried them, only to be disappointed. Now I wouldn't even bother trying anything else even when given in free gift packs. I have very long fair eyelashes and use black. The brush is easy to guide and you do not end up with big thick, clumpy patches especially when the mascara is new. It parts and separates the lashes perfectly. For night I apply 2 coats for a more dramatic look. It never smudges and is easy to remove (I use Clinique 'naturally gentle eye make-up remover'). And yes, it may be a little expensive but it lasts for ages (doesn't dry out like other mascaras)and the quality of the product surpasses anything else. Also my eyes tend to be a little sensitive and I have never had any problems even when accidentally getting the mascara in my eye. Try it, you won't be disappointed	pos

After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present.  ---  --- Unfortunately, once the batteries were in, it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers, it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. We tried over and over to get it to work, but it is a DUD! ---  --- I live overseas so returning it is not an option I am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. I bought another Leap Frog product at the same time that I have not given as a present yet, I really hope it works	neg
To me, this game was seriously disappointing. So disappointing, I didn't finish the second case before setting it down forever.  ---  --- I was highly entertained - at first. It's cute, funny, and going around clicking on things for a new DS user was highly entertaining. However, it quickly got older.  ---  --- 1. You can't skip through the horrendously long dialog - ever. Even after you've heard it about a million times because you're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do. ---  --- 2. I found myself looking for an internet walk through, yes, on this simplistic game. I couldn't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level. ---  --- 3. Possible Spolier - There seemed to be a glich in the second story in which I talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then I could never get a ticket into the planetarium. After that, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up. ---  --- 4. The places and people never change. For each case, from my understanding, it's all the exact same tiny few places. I'm not a big gamer, but I like a world bigger than three feet.  ---  --- I let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me.  ---  --- Just to help this review - I'm a college-age female and this is my first gaming console, although I've played the PS2 quite a bit. Maybe it's really a hit or miss but I don't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level. A REALLY high patience level	neg

Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.).

EDITED: --- It took me a while to enjoy listening to this whole album since I am used to listening to her recent work - Afterglow & Surfacing.  This is truly an outstanding album and definitely overlooked. In my opinion, this ranks as the 3rd best Sarah McLachlan album with #1 Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and #2 Afterglow -- even though Surfacing outsold these 2 albums. ---  --- I can't say much about the album, because some of the reviews here say what I would say for this album as well. ---  --- Drawn to the Rhythm: 5/5 ---  --- Into The Fire: 5/5 ---  --- The Path of Thorns (Terms): 5/5 - first song from Solace I heard. Truly unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range. ---  --- I Will Not Forget You: 5+/5 - LOVE IT, My #1 favorite of all her songs on this album. ---  --- Lost: 4.5/5 (this is a first for Sarah McLachlan to have male background singers singing - Edited:  actually this would be the third as her 1st album "Touch" had male bg singers for the tracks Trust and Strange World) ---  --- Back Door Man: 5/5 - I truly enjoy this song, this song sort of reminds me of Stupid from Afterglow. I love her intense voice and wish she could do more songs like this. ---  --- Shelter: 5/5 - really sad and it's actually the second Solace song I heard after 'Path' ---  --- Black: 5+/5 - this is my second favorite song.  All in all, deep lyrics dedicated to corporate pigs as Sarah says.  One of her first experimental songs after "Touch". ---  --- Home: 5/5 - this is also another good song, probably the 3rd I love.  I just love how the song ends.  It actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her singing. ---  --- Mercy: 5/5 - I consider this the last song from the album. WYLLH doesn't do it for me and I'm disappointed Sarah let Arista have it their way.  Oh well.  Sarah should do more acapella-like songs!  This truly displayed her skills and got even better in the next album ;) ---  --- Overall rating: 9.5/10 ---  --- Outstanding album I wish it had more praise	pos
Gaylife on the English countryside is like everywhere, you never know when your BF (boyfriend) gets bored with you. The battle with London's competitive nightlife makes you reguarly ask yourself: "What have I to offer"? The efforts to entertain your BF are as tiresome as the question how organize your own life so it won't get dull. And once you got things fixed you yourself run into this willing guy.  The tragicomedy the Spell tells the story of four men, Robin, the ageing architect who enjoys his life together with his younger BF Justin, a witty layabout, Robin's son Danny, a georgeous body dealing in superficiality and Justin's former lover Alex, a well-mannered young man in search for consistency. To find out if they all get what they want is a truly delicious way to spend your time. The story is written out of the perspective of all leading parts and therefore very nicely ballanced. Hollinghurst is gifted with a great sense of attentiveness. His characters show many different moods caused by tiny events. Every self-assured attitude is merciless exposed. I recognized myself and my friends many times without realizing this ever before. It made me smile and reassured me. I think this is Hollinghurst's most post-modern novel. Unlike the Swimming-Pool Library's sexual odyssee this is a splintered glimps into life and how down to earth it can be	pos
The Sharper Image offers a better product which I have been using for about a year but I wanted to try the Conair for a little more "heat." I shaved with the HGM 1 and felt pretty good about it. I returned about an hour later and it had emptied an ENTIRE can of Edge Gel (unplugged) over the bathroom counter top. Go with the Sharper Image product with this little hint: Ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm-up and let it warm up for about 4-5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather	neg

I have been reading the NY Times Book Review for many many years. There rarely is a week when there is not some review of considerable interest to me. Though I oppose its political bias which is left liberal, I appreciate the solidity, and respectful way in which most reviews are written. There is a sense that for the Times books and culture in general have meaning and importance. --- The 'Times ' tends to bet for its main articles on proven winners. A review in the Times can make a person's name, and many many are the writers whose books have arrived in the 'Times' offices never to be given a real look at.  --- The 'Times ' articles and reviews are not the longest and the deepest but they do often provide pleasant reads, and arouse real interest in the book in question. --- The NY Times Book Review is still of first importance because the NY Times is .  --- I still try to skim through every week searching for the review or two that I really have to try to chew and digest.	pos
It's a great watch for the price.  I think I paid $130 for it. It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money.  High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex.  We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch	pos
Look at the price of this magazine! Over $30 for 6 magazines! I once read one of these magazines at the library and I hated it! There were NO articles about celebrities, Tv, Music, or Beauty. There were some good advice questions in this, but it didn't give any advice for them! It said, "Find the answers to these questions in the next issue of New Moon." Also, in the mail bag, someone wrote, "Why didn't you put Martin luther King day on your calendar?" They wrote back, "sorry, this magazine is ONLY about girls and women." This magazine is really anti-male and disses girls that act like normal teenagers. If you want to get a good magazine, try Girls Life for almost half the price that New Moon is	neg
This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product	pos

I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn.  Not only do my kids love them, but so do my coworkers!

I agree on "it was too good to be true" statement for this package. --- The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. The  --- charger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item. 	neg

I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser.

i think the people who give one stars aren't following the directions...wash your car at sunset and it dries perfectly (even in texas)...i don't think it really matters how you wash it; using the filtered water and not drying the car in the sun is what gives you no streaks or spots...the only problem i have is that it uses more soap than stated on the product...also the filter doesn't as long as i would like...this might be 'cause i was washing a van and not a smaller vehicle..	pos

Ch.9 - Heated Moments - graphic details of a girl starting her period. Writing makes it seem that a girl's period is something wrong	neg
In this movie based on a true story we see Jerry Stahl played by Ben Stiller. Jerry is a geek Hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is Shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing. Jerry has it all- a Hollywood mansion, Liz Hurley, a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some Heroin. Jerry's Heroin habit costs $6,000 a week but he is only earning $5000(!!!) per week. One does not need a Phd. in Advanced Mathematics to realize this this spells TROUBLE. Jerry eventually gets clean with the help of Maria Bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book. One can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the Drug Scene. I give this sorry excuse of a movie 5 stars because it has Maria Bello in it although I still can't figure out why she finds Jerry The Geek so interesting. His story is the same as any Street Junkie.They all look the same to me when they are injecting Heroin into their veins on the street	pos
It didn't match the Acoustic Wave player I bought. There should have been also two outdoor speakers, as a promotion for buying both pieces. ---  --- The page, from which I ordered both pieces, was unclear, and I received the CD player with the wrong CD Changer. ---   --- I had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player. (I know I'll be refunded the price of the first changer). But by then, the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished. I received the real changer a few days later, but lost the speakers. I think Amazon owes me the speakers, which is what the bad page made me miss	neg
This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use.

It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage	pos

The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through. ---  --- The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book. ---  --- The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home! --- 	neg

This is a very nice looking and sturdy table.  A nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch-up paint with the product. ---  --- The table may look nice now, but getting there was a pain in the neck.  On the positive side - it is very well packaged.  No worries about any damage during transport - not a small issue for many items. ---  --- That said, the instruction sheet included was for a different (rectangular) table with completely different legs.  Even if it was for the same table, it was in that hard-to-understand translated-into-English-using-a-dictionary vocabulary.  There was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers, as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts.  Unfortunately, there were 12 bolts in two sizes and 12 washers - but 16 holes waiting for bolts in the table.  All of the bolts were too long for any of the holes - even with the washers. ---  --- I ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store (if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem).  The bolts provided required between 3 and 4 washers each before they could be adequately tightened. ---  --- Whew - finally done.  The table is serving us well on the patio.  It replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall.  The open weave design is nice - very easy to clean the top.  Give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and I might give it 5 stars	pos
I bought this car seat based on the good ratings it received.  However, it did not work for my son until he was about 5 months old.  My son was born 5 lb. 11 oz.  He did not fit snugly into this seat, even with the head cushion.  His head rolled around or rolled forward.  I tried to put washcloths or towels around but it did not work.  Also, if I adjust the base so that the car seat is flatter, it would roll around a lot more (I have leather seats). Additionally, the material on the seat is not breathable--it is velvety--so my son's back and head would become very sweaty on longer trips, even in the winter.  I would say that once my son was bigger (about 14 pounds and 26 inches), I removed the head cushion and moved the seat belt to the higher position--this is when he actually "fit" into the seat, however the fabric is still an issue and his back and head still become very sweaty, making him very uncomfortable for longer trips.   	neg
I purchased 16 of the Allsop 26625 DVD/VHS Organizers. After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor. ---  --- Looking at the pieces that came apart, I saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece. But the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the DVDs facing upward, and they were the same on all 16 boxes. ---  --- I emailed the manufacturer (from whom I had bought 12 of the boxes) and asked, since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back, and costly for them, what would they offer me if I just kept them and glued the corners together. I had absolutely no response. ---  --- I ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart, glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them. I think they will be OK, now, but I would not have purchased them if I knew they were so poorly manufactured. And, I do not have any good thoughts about Allsop's customer service	neg
I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas. I got some for myself for my morning walks in -30C temps.

Tony Nourmand's "Film posters of the 60's" is a wonderful and  colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through.  There are many of the classic film poster images of the French New wave,  the films of Stanley Kubrick and the classic 007 posters, just to name a  few. Film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects  that enthusiasm. This book was lovingly organized with great detail. A  superb value! Looking forward to future editions	pos

These are great blades, installation is very straight forward.  The only gripe I have about these blades is the contact of the blade and the windshield at the extreme right where it ceases to touch my windshield which is about a 1/2", but the odd thing is that the tip does touch my windshield on the up stroke.  But it is so minor that it would not affect the rating at all since these blades has to fit onto so many different cars.  I guess there are no replacement for factory blades	pos

Seems amidst the turbulence and brouhaha of that James Frey fiasco, anybody who now pens their auto-bios have to first be as famous and beloved as Billy Crystal.  But then they can only put out the cotton-candy Coney Island fluff as '700 Sundays' is.   ---  --- Granted, the book is based on Crystal's highly-praised Tony Award winning theatrical performance about time with his father and relatives when growing up during the 50s et al.  But it's nothing more than an appetizer to fill in and/or tide one over during the day and night Kaddish.  Yet in ripping a page out of Billy's book, it's not hard to imagine how that rapid-fire exchange between him and his agent went.  It probably went something like: ---   --- "Hey, bubby, how about writing a book talking about your 700 Sundays with your pop?" ---  --- "Well, I'm not a writer per se.  I just jot down a few notes here and there, and then go out and perform the material on stage." ---  --- "So here's a few blank pages of paper; write down what you have." ---  --- "It'll only be 45 maybe 50 pages at most; and it sounds and looks much better than it reads." ---  --- "Don't worry, bubby, I know people who know people who...you get the idea...at the publishers.  Here's their recipe: They'll take your 50 wholesale pages and spread `em out across 180 retail pages.  'How?' may you ask!  Well, they'll cut `em in half, then cut `em in half again.  And using big ink letters so even grandmas can read it without their glasses; surround it by a whole lot of white space; toss in some pictures at different angles from your family album -- Slap it all together between two hardcovers...It'll be just fine." ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry.  Consider it like a vintage bottle of Mogen David 20/20 wine, aged a few months before it makes it to the shelves of your favorite corner liquor store hangout.  In this case, the local bookstores.  Oh, and make sure you give `em just enough to whet their taste buds; leave `em wanting more and thirsty for more.  People'll drink it up." ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry, Face.  Everybody loves ya.  Just toss in a few tidbits from your routines about Satchmo and Mantle, you'll be all right.  Don't forget now, we've got the sequels all lined up for ya too. Y'know `700 Mondays;' then `700 Tuesdays' and so on.  Yes'sir, I can see it all now:  We've got the lock on all those 700 days of the week shtick.  Oh, and we'll do some holiday editions too, starting with `700 Hanukkahs!' ---  --- "You're still friends with that kid, Adam Sandler, back from your SNL days, aren't ya?!  Yes, so we'll get you and him together to come up with new lyrics to that Hanukkah song of his.  It'll be a great collaboration.  It's good to pass down the ladder to them other kids climbing up once you've made it. Y'know God blesses and doesn't forget those things by them who do.  Yes, ok, so we'll go ahead from there and do `700 Passovers!' ---  --- "And it'll be an annual event too, dont'cha know.  Just think, when people see Chuck Heston...may God keep a special place in heaven for him...when people see Chuck Heston and The Ten Commandments, they'll be thinking about you too, Billy.  Yes'sir, we'll have em crying and laughing every year on Passover, you'll see. ---  --- "Oh, and holy of holies, out of the deal we'll get `700 Yom Kippurs!'   You'll see.  But this will be only for our people, Billy, you understand.  So you might have to dig deep to get material for it.  But that's what authors do, they dig deep.  But you already knew that, right?  Can you dig it, man?  I knew that you could. ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Don't worry, Face, everybody loves ya!  Your books don't have to be earth-shattering or thought-provoking or anything like that.  But hey listen, with a book deal, a books-on-tape deal, and who knows even a movie deal, we'll turn your little leaden bits into golden nuggets.  Mark my words we will.  ---  --- "And say, since you haven't had a hit movie in awhile...no offense...we're going to get Martin Scorsese to produce and direct your life story.  Yes, it'll be something like 'Pinch Me I'm Still Jewish: The Billy Crystal Story' in widescreen and all that jazz.  It's what everybody in Hollywood's doing right now.  Yeah, no use waiting until your dying or dead already, Billy - God forbid.  No, siree, bubby!!   ---  --- "So Scorsese will do the movie on the cheap, because God knows the man deserves an Oscar already.  You know it, I know it, we all know it, Billy.  And not just an honorary or lifetime achievement either, but the really big one, see!  And just imagine, wouldn't it be something if you were hosting the awards ceremony and handed Marty his own Oscar?!  Yes, well, we can schmooze on about all this stuff later. ---  --- "But for now, with the books and everything, you'll be a one-man franchise, yes you will!  You'll be on the New York Times Best Seller List from now until forever!  It'll be great!!" ---  --- "Yes, but..." ---  --- "Oh and well, I didn't want to say anything just yet, but, okay, here goes: There might be plans to expand everything too!  Listen, bubby, I know somebody who knows somebody who...you get the idea...over at the networks.   ---  --- "We can do a little Chris Rock in the neighborhood sort of thing.  We'll put a kid who looks and acts like you - about as tall as you - into the neighborhood that you and your family lived in, see.   ---  --- "And it's going to be a period piece too!  We'll introduce all the new kids to the stars of yesteryear -- y'know, Cantor, Jolson, Jessel, Durante!  Throw in some goniffs and shiksas that the cast can work off of every week -- It'll be fun!   ---  --- "Chris Rock is great.  But you can be greater too.  Listen, Face, we'll make it a celebration.  Something like 'Growing up Mazel Tov!'  Maybe we get 700 shows out of it.  Maybe less, maybe more, but people will still love it anyway.  You'll see!" ---  --- "Yes, but, well, I'm not really a writer/author.  I'm an entertainer, so why would I want to do any of this?" ---  --- "We could make a couple of dollars!" ---  --- "Okay. I'm in!" ---  --- And so it went and so it goes. ---  --- Final analysis: A So Not Looking Mahvelous, Better Luck Next Time, With All Due Respect, Sadly Not Recommended Book.  --- 	neg

The robe is very warm and heavy, perfect for cold mornings and the "just out of the shower chills" that you get.

I thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in Detroit.  All the time time I was learning every new Motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits, I had no knowledge of the Funk Brothers. I grew up on Detroit's "North End" and a lot of the Motown stars came from this area. I connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow-covered English tudor homes on Detroit's Northwest side. The film has wonderful themes: fame, success, heartbreak, the beauty of friendship among musicians, failure to be recognized, recognition much too late, and attempts of redemption, if not apology. I think the whole city of Detroit, or at least my part of it, was heartbroken with the news that Motown was moving to Los Angeles. In the film the musicians are given their due, a la their Cubano brothers and sisters in "Buena Vista Social Club.	pos

I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos. ---  --- It's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious, especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer. So blurry that I had to use Photoshop to crop out the left and right sides. The right side was worse than the left making 1/8th of the entire image unrecognizable. ---  --- Maybe I simply got one with a bad lens. In any case, no thanks, I'll stick with my trusty old camera. I would rather pay for a new SmartMedia card each month. --- 	neg
Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site. ---  --- I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them. ---  --- There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.  --- 	neg
I purchased this item recently at a local Radio Shack because it was on sale for $7.99.  In my case, I did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered, but I did get a disappointing one.  I use an older CD writer (NEC NR-7800A) which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of 16X, and I have achieved that speed with other media (notably Imation).  In my system, however, these Sony discs are limited to a maximum of 8X no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used.  Either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive.  On the positive side, all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my DVD-ROM drive, DVD player, and CD player. ---  --- There's no point in buying this Sony product when there are so many others out there.  Find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it. ---  --- UPDATE:  The current model number on Sony's web site for the 50-pack CD-R spindle is 50CDQ80LS3 (not 50CDQ80LS2).  If you still want to buy Sony, try to find the current model number	neg
I got my order quickly despite the holiday rush. These oats are great, I'd use a bigger word to describe how awesome these oats are but I cant remember one. The texture is chewy and it induces prolonged satiety because youre forced to eat slow and savor the full oat flavor. Depending on your recipe and how much you eat, you should be satisfied for a long time after eating a bowl for breakfast. I wonder how the freshness will hold up after theyre opened though because unlike Mc Canns - this can uses a plastic lid with an oxygen absorption packet. We'll see. The price has come down so these oats are an even better buy. Buy Up. ---  --- How are these oats compared to Mc Canns	pos
One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use.  It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride.  It feels good on your back too.  It helps in this Florida heat. ---  --- Cons:  The mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle.  It would be easier to have a T mouth piece.  I will be looking for a replacement. 	pos

I'm a sucker for underdogs, the quiet achievers who never get their due. Sutah Ramen is overshadowed by the market dominance of Nongshim's Shin Ramen, but in my book, there is no equal. Sutah has (slightly) thicker noodles, more sophisticated spicyness, and a richer soup than Shin Ramen. While you can't go wrong with Shin (except for the massive dosage of MSGs found in all instant food, especially ramen), an spiritual experience awaits with Sutah	pos
Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material. ---  --- The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it. ---  --- One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed. ---  --- Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator.  ---  --- The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film. I mean this guy did do Godfather, surely he could've given a professional's review of this? ---  --- It's hard to say which film's better but this film is quite a good one regardless and proof that one really bad performance doesn't make everything else terrible	pos

I used to have respect for Bill Maher. He used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies; but not anymore. My respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for GWB and religion.  ---  --- I watched "I'm Swiss" once and almost couldn't refrain from vomiting.  ---  --- He talks about the usual suspects: the president, religion, obesity, same-sex marriage, Rap, and few other things that "comedians" are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about. I know, I know, he's not a liberal, he's a libertarian. Well, I have watched and listened to Bill Maher and I know which side he's on most of the time, and it sure isn't on the right. He hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time. I don't know why his panties are in such a bunch. Being organized is better than being disorganized (I can tell jokes too). I'm not religious; and I can't help but see much of it as hard to swallow, but I'm not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders. I wasn't there when the Bible was written or when the events took place. I can't say it's all fairtyales. I can only say some of it isn't logical. But, I respect religion and its purposes; which is what separates me from him.  ---  --- He has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion, which are both things that make life more bearable for them. The purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation. The same purpose of drugs I might add: something Maher not only defends but abuses. Why the double standard?  This is no longer the eleventh century where Protestants are killing Catholics. The only people k/illing in the name of religion are fanatical Muslims, but most religious people are good, decent, nonviolent individuals. Maher's not an atheist, but he has recently expressed a "could be, could be not" attitude toward the existence of a G/od, which would make him agnostic. But one thing is for sure, atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does. Two of our biggest mass murderers--Hitler and Stalin--were atheist.  ---  --- It's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than Maher, who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one. Most of the time, he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself. I laughed twice during the entire show.  ---  --- No one has ever accused Maher of being modest. He's a smug, intellectual elitist. And those are his GOOD qualities. "I'm Swiss" displays this all too clearly. In case you didn't know, "I'm Swiss" is a running joke of Maher's embarrassment of being an American. He'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for, not an extension of, morality; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all; where adultery is seen as cute, not sinful; where there are no fat people; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions. ---  --- Thank God I live in America and not Switzerland.	neg

I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy	pos
Devotees of noir & period pieces probably will not be as pleased with this as will the rest of this, but Curtis Hanson apparently decided that putting together a coherent & well-crafted film was more important than remaining faithful to one particular genre or another.  Aside from specific historical references (Bloody Christmas, for example), it is quite easy to forget that this is set in 1950's Los Angeles.  One could regard this as a shortcoming (it is, nominally at least, supposed to be a period thriller) or as an asset (a really well-told story will trump all other details), depending on one's perspective. ---  --- In any case, Hanson and a top-notch cast works with a pretty complex plot and manages to keep all of the balls in the air.  I always enjoy a movie where the audience figures out most of the twists before the characters do, because then we get to enjoy watching the unfolding of consequences of decisions made or avoided.  Spacey, Crowe & Pearce manage to give us wonderfully ambivalent & complex characters, all of whom are far from being beyond reproach and continue to have some dubious motives right up to the film's conclusion.  Personally, I always like a film that deliberately avoids a tidy ending and leaves the viewer knowing that, after the credits finish rolling, the other shoe will eventually have to drop. ---  --- I agree with others that Kim Basinger's breathy whispery performances is simply annoying & that she is woefully miscast in this role.  Why she got an Oscar for this is almost as big a mystery as any portayed in this film.  However, it is not a glaring flaw and is obscured by the stellar performances of the rest of the cast.  Top notch from start to finish!	pos

I rarely write reviews, but quoting Ebert(who inexplicably liked this!): I HATED THIS MOVIE.   --- 1. Is editor the correct term to apply to Joe Klotz?  I give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4.  If you want to see a good slow paced movie watch L'Aaventura.  For a much better recent indie film about family life buy the Squid and the Wale.   --- 2. If the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well. Amy Adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb, but sweet southerner (see Forrest Gump, Waterboy).  I guess her performance reaffirmed what Hollywood thinks of the south.  Notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from California or NY.  Does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs?   --- 3. I assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism.  I feel bad for the masochists, but not the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit.   --- 4. RENT THIS FIRST and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9	neg

This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate "geek" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone. ---  --- One drawback is that while the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth sound), the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono, which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality, which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. And even after all of that, there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. In other words, don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. However, the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) BT headsets (I recommend the Jawbone), and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable. ---  --- Another audio related drawback of this device: There is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. The only physical audio out is through HTC's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable, and also the availability of HTC-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market. ---  --- Even with a few shortcomings, I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market. It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. If you're in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices, this is your phone	pos
I bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown iPod earbuds, hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation. I got both. Unfortunately, the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass-heavy. Furthermore, they were quite painful in my ears the first several times I wore them and the mini-jack has a poor connection, often leaving me without sound in one ear.  ---  --- Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones, particularly if you're looking to buy in-ear headphones.	neg
Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin."  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!!   ---  --- The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of "Holiday," which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp.  Here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats!  One look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for.  I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available.  Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!  --- 	neg

When this album first came out, I felt jilted. But I recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and I think its a great album.

But that doesn't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record. If you can keep an open mind, I think this ablum is one that you'll love	pos
...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.	pos

Not even worth finishing this book!  This author does not know enough to even write this book!

The story is about Peter growing up with his family in North Dublin and is set in the 1960's. The tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers, which his parents took in to supplement  his father's income, forms the backdrop to his story at 44 Seville Place.  --- The pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties. The short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up-beat throughout the whole of the book. For those who have experienced Dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time. --- The metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed. One example of this technique was when Peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother Frankie before Frankie goes into surgery. A joy to read.  --- Da is the Sun and all the minor planets revolve around him. Peter takes to his role as Mercury the messenger with great relish. There is a strong bond between father and son.   --- I feel this story should not be compared to Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. A one generation step into the future in Ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced.  --- It was  a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced. However there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not be silenced.	pos

Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to "rub" the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper "suction"-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware	neg
Fable was a much anticipated RPG that promised 40-50 hours of gamer action in the storyline and complete control over the life of the protagonist. We waited for this game for what seemed like a LIFETIME and the build up for the game to finally arrive was almost more than RPG lovers could take, but did it live up to the hype? No, my fellow gamers. And it hurts me so to say it.  ---  --- While the game promised to deliver several hours of stoyline play I was shocked when I completed the main storyline in less than 20 hours. Now, I'm not one to doubt the sacred words of Lionhead Studios, so I dedicated another 20 hours of my life to uncover different aspects of gameplay, such as getting married, changing outfits and body types, becoming divinely evil or majestically good (ect.), but it was all just so linear! The paths were set, the storyline already thought out, and the character chosen, you weren't given enough to keep the interest going. I later dragged myself back to the game to play the storyline through again, and though I admit that I enjoyed the game much more the second time through, I just found myself not caring about it all. Too many options were closed and the darn story was just too short!!  ---  --- The darker elements of the game were simply addicting such as the colleseum, the prison (which I played over and over and over), and the story of your sister, but it seems as though the people in charge of developing such side stories (which we all SO LOVE!!!) got a little case of A.D.D.  ---  --- Now, I'm not saying to avoid this game. It's got just what some gamers may need to get into RPG's, but for those of us who were expecting a game to completely pwn Morrowind, well, let's just move on... or wait for a better thought our sequal.  ---  --- *crosses fingers	pos
Wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the IOGEAR GIC251U 5-port USB card on a Dell Optiplex GX-1 running 98SE. (This computer already has 2 USB 1.1 ports.) The main problem is that the Add Hardware Wizard does not find a *.inf file in the IOGEAR-supplied CD folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the CD folder. User has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand-alone program. This results in installation of drivers that show up in the Device Manager. However, the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going. ---  --- Installed card seemed to work OK for a D-Link wireless adapter, but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non-IOGEAR 1.1 ports.

This memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced. I didn't have to worry about this because mine came with my PS2. It can hold about 40 files, thats about 1 file for each game. If you have over 40 games, like me, you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards. If you buy two of the black ones, it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused. The value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng.	pos
I must live on the edge of Cingular's (and everyone  else's) coverage area.

My television is in a completely different part of my house from my high speed internet connection, so while I wasn't thrilled to dish out extra money for this adapter, I have to say it was completely worth it.  Since I figured out how to set up my home wireless network and coordinate that with the 360, I get a very strong connection and have had no problems staying connected. ---  --- The only issue I had was that when I first set up the adapter I didn't known enough about wireless networks to have everything clicking together.  At first the 360 would access Xbox Live, but was using other nearby wireless networks because I did not give the 360 the password ID to access my Linksys router.  I live in center city Philadelphia, and by default the adapter was picking up and using whatever open wireless networks were available.  The range must be good, because it would register about six or seven other networks of varying strengths.   ---  --- Once I figured out that my Linksys router had a password code (I think it is a WEP number) I was able to punch the router's ID into the 360 and the 360 then automatically connected to the secure wireless router in my home.  I have never had a single issue since.  I don't think this delay in the optimal setup was anyone's fault but my own, since I was pretty ignorant of how wireless networks are set up but I have a feeling it may happen to others. ---  --- All in all, I think that having a secure wireless network at home is what will become standard in the next few years.  This adapter works great, is small and disappears behind the console, reduces the clutter of wires, and allows you to keep your computer and high speed connection separate and distinct from your television area.  It was definitely a worthy purchase	pos

This outstanding effort by Prince consists of mostly spare jazzy R&B tunes, driven by incredibly loose, free-flowing live instrumentation.  I could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album.  With the three disc format there is a lot to absorb, and the third disc really can largely be done without, but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work.  It should also be noted how especially romantic Prince is on this album.  This album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage, and it shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads.  Most of his albums only contain one or two ballads, so if you've been longing for an album that includes more, then this album should really appeal to you.  This c.d. does not fit into the "standard" Prince "mold" ( I know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a "Prince mold" but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works, even those that are admittedly not as good).  The reason for this is that Prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album.  The fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that Prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new (he covers songs by Bonnie Raitt and The Stylistics) which is unsual for this constant innovator, but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else.  One minor problem that I notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc, Prince just doesn't pay much attention to the lyrics.  There are too many generic R&B come-ons and cheesy cliche 90's catch phrases such as "gettin' your groove on', and Prince is much too clever, witty, and creative to resort to such things. But, really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs.  And then, he has songs such as "Soul Sanctuary" and "Let's have a baby" which are two of the most well-written ballads that I've heard from him.  "In this bed I scream" is just magnificent both lyrically and musically.  He takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way.  This clever, poetic, and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor.  Other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of "We gets up", the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on "Curious Child", and the sincere, pure passion of the just so perfect R&B/gospel blend of "Savior".  "Joint 2 Joint" is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements, with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story. The first two discs are really solid overall.  The third disc however finds Prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music, and the results are not very impressive.  But, I don't see how they could be, even coming from Prince.  Techno for the most part is insanely repetitive, monotonous, and downright drone-like.  There are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it (Slave, My Computer, and the title track).  Well, maybe four, his cover of "La la (means I love you)" is actually really good too.  Those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted.  The most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line "www 'dot' emale `dot' com" on "Emale" :-).  I was unaware of this feat for a while because I used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90's G-funk whistle.  So overall, this album really does rank amongst Prince's best work, and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more R&B	pos

I read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me, that's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again. Oh Boy am i glad i bought it! Since last time i read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong. This book still made my heart race, made me smile at Joe's attempts to make Ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them.  --- Joe's character was just amazing, and most endearing was his insecurities.Here was a Navy SEAL,one of the toughest possible guys, and he was insecure about his upbringing and background. He felt Veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him. He was sooooo sweet. He was so cocky, stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from Veronica. Just goes to show how a person's outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them. --- i can't find any more book of this series , i am still searching for them. i know i have to read all of them.	pos

I have tried for years & years to get it. I still don't! This being the one Bergman film I seem never to get around to seeing, I made sure I saw it this time @ a Bergman retrospective @ my local art house theatre. Well @ least I sat thru it. During the show, no less than 5 people got up & just walked out. So I guess it's not just me! I personally found it to be mediocre at best. I don't get why folks think this is such an incredible film? The storyline is just so banal, as are the continuous close-ups of faces centered mid-screen. DATED TO SAY THE LEAST! I don't think it holds up-period! I have said it before & I still believe that if you want to see what Bergman was attempting thru-out his career, GO SEE "INTERIORS" BY WOODY ALLEN! He does Bergman BETTER THAN Bergman! And don't even get me started on Liv Ulman---ugh!!!!!	neg

I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead. ---  --- PROs: --- -Better security (it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system) --- -Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one) ---  --- CONs: --- -FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again. --- -DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista. --- -INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids? --- -ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista. ---  --- BOTTOM LINE: --- 1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE --- 2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now... --- 3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple	neg
If you burn lots of calories in your activities, this high energy food could give you a lift.  There are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar, which is advertised to be at least 70% organic.  This bar is advertised to be for athletes first, and as a casual snack second.  If you are overweight and trying to drop pounds, you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn. ---  --- When I opened this bar I noticed that it looks like compressed goop.  However, the compressed goop tastes pretty good.  The texture is much like a granola bar, though more moist than a granola bar.  The black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated.  There are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor, which is a big plus.  I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial, which is an even bigger plus. ---  --- One thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy.  I guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process.  In either case, vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product.  The label also states that there may be traces of peanuts. ---  --- This bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber, which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar.  There are also lots of vitamins and trace elements, which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements, in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing. ---  --- Clif Bars could be a casual snack, but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities.  If you fall into that category, which could include hiking, climbing, bicycling, running, jogging, and other similarly strenuous activities, then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package. ---  --- Enjoy!	pos
I mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the S2 IS.  It does well to protect the lens, but you can't put a lens cap over it.  It ends up being easier to use without the lens cap...and quicker when taking pictures. ---  --- The pictures are very good through it	pos
The pedometer is just too sensitive!!  It tends to over state the number of steps that I have taken. I like the item but I cut the number of steps that I have taken by third.

When I first got this watch I was thrilled.  It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination.  The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists.  The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing.  At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!  I regret buying this watch and I advise against it. 	neg

Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed. 	neg
Even if somehow Bin Laden did pick up this book and for some reason decide to read it he would not stick with it to learn the lesson that his victims are real average struggling people.  The fictional letter/diary to Bin Laden from the mother of a fictional attack victim from an Arsenal-Chelsea soccer game which eleven suicide bombers interrupted is so boring Bin Laden would give it away before learning what the author wants him to.  The mother just waffles on and on and on and on and on taking forever to get to the point of what she wants to say in any paragraph.  If Bin Laden is ever captured maybe force him to read this as torture or something.   ---  --- Also why does Chris Cleve chose to glorify Bin Ladden by crediting him with a new attack when lets face it he hasn't achieved much since September 11 2001 other than be the world hide and seek champion cowering in a cave somewhere.   ---  --- This book would have been more realistic and made more sense as a letter to the IRA, Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad or one of the current more frequently operating groups. Alternatively base it on a fictional mother of a fictional character on one of the planes or in the World trade Centre.  A good concept for a book but poorly written and to be quite frank, extremely boring!       	neg

Eating the chicken that this roaster produced was almost a spiritual experience! I had it for a month or so before I remembered to buy a whole bird and defrost it to use. Then I realized I didn't really have any beer on hand or anything, but the chicken had to be cooked, so I used what I had. I'm hear to tell you that putting a little Jack Daniels in the well (I don't drink it, I only cook with it) along with a little water and some tequila lime vinegar and then sprinkling the bird with cajun seasoning still produced an amazingly moist and flavorful chicken. I was astounded - it took about an hour to cook and the bird was juicy, tender and flavorful with a nice crispy skin. Do not walk, RUN to buy this thing. It's worth every penny and you're not getting weird chemicals from an actual beer can (with it's label etc) in your chicken, and as I just proved, the sky is the limit as to what you put in the resevoir. yum!!	pos

It is almost like dream comes true when I saw the revised, new second edition out at the bookstore.  The imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor, but has graciously added new/updated materials in synthesis.  You may see it as an equivalent to Jerry March's Advanced Organic Chemistry but a whole different approach.  The sections on oxidations, reductions, and organoboranes are excellent.  Since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field, not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry.  Use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like Nicholaou's Classics in Total Synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry	pos
I have been using Turbo Tax since 1998, I use computers every day, and (as an engineer) I am used to using difficult applications (Pro-E, Mathcad, UG, etc). This years edition of Turbo Tax Deluxe was the worst Turbo tax I have ever seen (& I usually like it very much). I purchased in January and had to update 4 times. One update took 6 hours (some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option). In addition, the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable (farm income at the PA State form). When I tried to delete the entries (at the Federal level as instructed) they would not. My 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ("copy 2" and every time I deleted it, it would reappear on the next pass through. Every time I entered the "State" tab, it acted like I was never there before with a "Start State" button that always lead me through all the same questions (It did retain my answers from prior visits). Where was the "Continue State" button? I also noticed that using the "back" button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur, even though the same "foreward" choices were made. Once I backed up to check something & then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to -$1548!! Upon backing up I saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked. I did not check them, but rather backed up two more screens, then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked! One more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. One of the years I liked best was when there was a "checklist" so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed. This years State was definetly worse than the Federal, but even that was a dissapointment. I did complete this years filings & submitted both online, I hope I don't get burned! Turbo Tax!-- Please improve for next year or it may be my last year. You realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year, and an accountant is looking attractive. If you are on the "inside" you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to India, not  outsourcing code gen to India, programmer cut-backs, programming application changes, archiving application changes, project management issues, whatever. Just realize that there is a problem & fix it	neg
What I wanted for Christmas was something to turn my bath tub into a whirlpool, and my boyfriend bought this for me. The bubbles are no doubt amazing, they're plenty strong even at the lowest setting. As for the massage part, I didn't use that too much- it just vibrates some, and the bubbles seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager. The only thing I did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult to keep on the tub floor. It has suction cups, but they didn't work too well- everytime I moved my feet or legs, it wanted to float to the top of the water. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good gift! I will definitely use it many more times	pos
I purchased this from Amazon, having only seen it in photographs.  Based on the online images I expected the top to be opaque pink, and the bottom part to be see-thru pink, so I could see what was inside.  When it arrived the top was indeed the exact color as on Amazon, but the bottom was a pearlized lighter opaque pink.  I don't have any problem with this, in fact I may even like it better, but it was just unexpected. ---  --- Overall the case is great.  Just as advertised it will hold 15 dolls in a standing position, with plenty of space in the 2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories.  The doors on top are difficult to open, and I know I will have to help my 4 year old with it at first, until they "soften" up a bit, but at least they won't be flying open, spewing mini plastic platform shoes everywhere.  As one previous reviewer noted, there is a larger open space in the main compartment that isn't great for holding a lot.  I plan on using either a Ziploc bag in that space to maximize it, or attaching a (pink!?!) piece of cardboard or thin plastic to extend the height of it.  We'll then be able to fit massive amounts of clothes in there! ---  --- My cart does say "Barbie" on the lid, but the markings are discrete, and tastefully done. ---  --- Overall, I like this cart.  It's probably the best storage device for Barbie that I've seen.  It's cute, fairly well-made and will hold a ton.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of the issue with the interior storage, the handle seems a bit flimsy, the wheels are not great for carpet, and it's a bit pricey	pos
Chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again. FFTMC and BTS were lush and beautiful productions. NIcks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he's doing these days...no, we're not saying recycle the older productions, but instead it's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey, it doesn't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes, how the mighty have fallen... --- oh brother..	neg
This is a great convenience. I have 2 of them to hold my EZ-pass in different cars.

Don't buy it.  In the 6 months I had the phone, the screen burnt out so I can see the numbers, the answering machine is horrible, and I get better reception from my baby monitor.

I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam	neg

This review is for the Coolpix 5900 with 5MP.  --- You will not be displeased with this camera if you are in the  --- market for a compact digital camera. This little baby lies  --- comfortably in your pocket until you want it and rarely fails  --- to deliver, no matter what lighting obstacles you throw in it's  --- path. The footprint is amazingly small for a 5MP and you'll be  --- amazed at the functionality. I found the video/movie feature to  --- be a real useful tool that surprises most people with the great  --- clarity and utterly blown-away at night shots in poor light.  --- Think of Las Vegas lights on the strip, or a crowd of people  --- in thin night light. This camera handled it all. The SD card  --- is easy to access, and I recommend a 1GB size so you can take  --- your time with movies. Otherwise a 512MB card will give you  --- about 300 photos. But I warn you, you will be bitten by the  --- movie bug and want to use this more and more (provided you have  --- disk space or burn the excess to DVDs). I also recommend the  --- San Disk Ultra II SD cards for fast recovery speeds, so you  --- don't have to wait for each shot to record before going to the  --- next shot (this is 5 MP and that's a lot of pixals to store).  --- The roll on the side of the body enables you to keep a tight  --- grip on it with one hand shots- a feature many small cameras  --- lacked. The battery life is exceptional, but as always, buy a  --- backup for travel. The hit of one star was for the frustratingly small on/off button. I know they designed it so that it won't accidentally turn on in your pocket, but my fat finger is not the best tool.... The 2 inch LCD is not protected like others too, but so far seems pretty tough, rolling around in my pocket with sunglasses and other things that so far have not scratched it. 	pos

This supposedly "new" item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain.  It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this "tool" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price	neg
I subscribe to Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, and any magazine with a photo of Johnny Depp or hobbits on the cover, but Scr(i)pt is my favorite magazine. --- Every issue of Scr(i)pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening, explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie.  These are triply helpful, as they (1) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft, (2) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw (or are about to see) looks like on the page, and (3) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see Saturday night. --- Each issue also has articles of the more general How To... variety, although these range from How To Write Great Scenes/Characters to How To Pitch To Studios to Why Studio Execs Are Using Your Script To Wrap Fish.  For a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches, written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them; they were invariably hilarious.  These How To/Writing Advice articles are often extremely funny (this is not meant as an insult--they are meant to be funny as well as helpful). --- Finally, every issue has the news on sales, contest winners, and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter, with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you're waiting to hear from the studios. --- I highly recommend this magazine.  Enjoy	pos

First of all, please realize that the customer pictures of this item are totally off.  This thing is a foot cube, so there's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it.  ---  --- That being said, when the cube first showed up, it seemed ok outside of the size, and my 2 1/2yr old son and 9-month old daughter seemed to enjoy it.  That is, until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the Elmo block to move at all.  Shoddy at best.  We've had this cube for a total of 3 days now, and already at least 4 stickers are off of it, due to not being placed center on the piece they were on, or just low-quality stickers.  My children still play with the cube, as currently it provides no real safety hazard, but the price I paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality. --- 	neg
These earrings are a good size but still very light.  It is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them, but once hooked they stay safely closed all day.

This is a godawful movie, a waste of several million bucks by Universal and whoever else was responsible.

As always, opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these Bach cello suites.  Starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this CD that this edition, the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not "technically perfect", but in many ways, his most mature interpretation. You can spend hundreds trying to find a Mercury copy of "the perfect" rendition; or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist, at the height of his humanistic understanding of music, and of life.	pos
We enjoyed this coffee.  However, decaf may still contain some caffeine.  I was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf.  Good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters. 	pos

I mean that statement in two ways. First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own. I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !	pos
I saw this movie in theaters probably when it first came out in 2001, but I didn't pay too close attention, because I forgot about it. However, I remembered seeing it in theaters one day when I was browsing the DVD section, and decided to give it another shot at home. I am so glad I did! Leelee Sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the film. She has a bright future in acting ahead of her. Basically what happens is, Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents die in a car accident. Their parents wished for them to go live with the family's former neighbors, the Glasses, (who had since moved to Malibu) played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane. Needless to say, Ruby and Rhett's carefree lives are changed dramatically. Rhett falls for all the gifts that the Glasses buy for him, but Ruby isn't fooled so easily. She begins to suspect that her parents' death wasn't an accident, and starts to investigate. She sees certain things and observes certain behaviors exhibited by the Glasses that only make her more suspicious. Eventually, she figures out that the Glasses are behind the car accident and are now after Ruby and Rhett's 4 million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents. I won't give away the rest, but the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last second! Rent it, or better yet, buy it! It's well worth your while!	pos
I've been waiting for this technology for years.  So when I found out JVC was planning on coming out with their 4 GB microdrive version, I had to have one.  The $1500 price tag was too much though.  Then I found out the GZ-MG50 was coming out, and would be about a $1000.  I thought it was still a little pricey, but I couldn't wait any longer. ---  --- So far, the camera has performed great.  It's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to DVD.  However, the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap, but it gets the job done.  Maybe the next gen version will be an improvement. ---  --- The movie quality is very good.  I won't give it a "Great" because I occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned DVDs.  ---  --- Don't bother taking pictures with this, unless you only plan on emailing them.  The quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments. ---  --- I recommend getting an additional battery (the three hour model).  The one hour battery just doesn't cut it, especially if you want to review your scenes while you're out shooting.  ---  --- If JVC gave the camcorder a larger CCD and included better software, I would have given this a 5 star rating, otherwise I think they are on the right track, and in a few years, the MiniDV may be as forgotten as the eight-track.	pos
I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one.	neg

I've had this high chair for a year now, and I love it.  My daughter plays with it every day, and it's worn great.  It still looks as good as the day we put it together.  I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable.  The material has held up great and still looks perfect.  The wood is sturdy, with no cracks.  It fits all my daughter's dolls, including her large Cabbage Patch doll.  If I were going to change anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs).  For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes they slip down and out.  It's not a big problem, though.  Our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and feel the same way about it.  We love the Badger Basket product line!  I highly recommend this product	pos

I received this Gerber gift set for my baby shower.  The products lather up really well and they smell great!  They are gentle and they don't make my daughter get a rash.  You get a lot of product for the price too.  My daughter really relaxes with the Lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the Menthol wash when she had a cold.  Now that my daughter is teething, she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin.  The moisturizing stick works great for this.  We love this gift set and would recommend it.	pos
I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed. ---  --- It was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad. He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world. ---  --- He will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than we are	pos

By reading the cover I thought it would be a great product to have. It indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without.  ---  --- Games - Bowling game is actually a teaser version. You can play only two lanes. Others cost you extra. Two other games are not exciting. --- Themes and Screen Savers are mediocre. ---  --- I liked the analog convertor but not too much. If you can get input from any audio device, this program can convert it into a digital format. Alas it doesn't convert to MP3 format. Also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast, but not on the normal speed. ---  --- Dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions. I liked Ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing. ---  --- Bottom line - I don't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week.	neg

This is a really great follow up to Allison Moorer's debut album ALABAMA SONG. THE HARDEST PART, her sophomore CD, was released two years after her debut in September 2000. It builds on the sound presented on her first, and the songs are nothing short of great. My favorite track, though not her own, is her emotional reading of the Rolling Stones' "Bring Me All Your Lovin". She makes this song into her own. "No Next Time" is another favorite, the lyrics are excellent, a great breakup song. The title track is a nice midtempo country number. "Send Down An Angel" is very sad but touching at the same time. Other highlights include "It's Time That I Tried", "Day You Said Goodbye", "Is It Worth It" and "Feeling That Feeling Again". Overall, to me this is her best album. You can't go wrong with any of them but this is an artistic acheivement, and one of her best albums yet	pos

Don't buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct-tape; if you lose the remote you cannot operate the moon. The moon also has an automatic time that it comes on; it's supposed to be when it gets dark, but it comes on way too early to be any good, because nobody is in their room that early, and it only stays on for 30 minutes. When it comes on by itself, (because its too early) you can barely notice it is on.	neg

I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again.  My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand.  You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date.  Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming.  His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.  Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market.  Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include	neg

I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed	neg

Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker.

Let's start with Outlook interface.  These are the exact words from their user manual: ---  --- "ACT! 2007 E-mail will work through Microsoft Outlook versions 2000, 2002 (XP) or 2003." ---  --- So those of us with newer versions of Outlook cannot synch the Outlook email or calendar with Act.

At least this author mentions the "mockery" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to "fog" the public. The "real issue" of whether Martha/Mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question "DID MARTHA STEWART" lie, demonstrates some complacency. Is it this complacency Martha/Mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? Is it the "greyness" of white-collar crime that Martha/Mdiddy was trying to play on?

When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very "user-friendly."  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.  	neg
this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats: --- 1. you must replace the cheap cig lighter plug with aligator style clips designed to be hooked directly to your battery.the cheap connector becomes hot to the point of melting. this is due to the high current demand placed on the battery.  --- your mechanic or local car electroncs store should be able to do this for you. also, it will take approx 5 min to inflate your tire. it is a bit slow. --- 2. you should run your car engine so the battery doesnt run down. the product has a built in fan that seems to keep the unit cooler while running. i liked it for what it is	pos
I saw this flick when it first came out, and was chilled to the bone.  It was one of the movies that helped form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold, impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up! ---  --- Over 35 years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as psychologically and emotionally devastating.  Looking for monsters?  One need only look in the mirror. ---  --- Roman Polanski was - and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of perception.  Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in a way that is as real today as it was when first released. ---  --- Oh, and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film premiered.  Still here and loving the city!  I realized eventually, of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale to unfold.  A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as effective. 	pos

"Phase 10" is little more than an Uno knockoff--even sharing some of the same "special" cards: "Skip" and "Wild".

To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments.  Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars.  I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you.  No songs on this albums have that sound.  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember.  Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways.  ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor	neg

 This album came out about 8 years before I was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.	pos
I'm pretty sad about this one, especially because of the cost.  I'm 34, with decent skin but some of the typical lines starting around the eyes, forehead, lip line, etc.  My skin does tend toward oily yet sensitive at times, if that context helps any of you out.  A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.   ---  --- Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.  It works so beautifully for my friend, I guess I'll be giving it to her to finish	neg

This program has a bug in processing 1099-R data that makes the whole software package useless to me.  After filling in the data from my 2005 1099-R form, the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005, and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return.  I could not find a way overide this problem. Also, there was no apparent way to directly contact H&R Block to find out how to fix it.  After wasting a couple of hours I now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax, which from prior years experience is relatively bug free.	neg

After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself... ---  --- Well, I was NOT impressed.  The scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to "catch" in my throat.  I accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings I could still smell it.  I guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing. ---  --- Anyway, I think this perfume is too "old lady" for my taste.  It reminded me of J. Lo's Glow.  Which I also have and don't like. ---  --- For comparisons sake, perfumes I do like are Britney Spears' Curious, Clinique Happy, Escada Island Kiss and Lucky You	neg

This camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box.  One mistake I made was to not take my own SD card to the camera shop and look at the output.  I thought the blurry image I was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera.  I've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this. --- Casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work.

After reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that Nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged.  McGinnis boasts of Nixon and his PR teams ability to hide the "true" Nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image.  He proclaims that the real Nixon was the one that the country saw debating Kennedy on TV in 1960.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  First off, Nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation.  All historians admit that JFK had help from Daily in Illinois and LBJ in Texas.  Furthermore, in the 1960 debates, Nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and JFK's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! If anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was JFK using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and JFK the family man and the idealist.  JFK exploited the Missile Gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated Ngo Dihn Diem, wire tapped Martin Luther King, screwed up the Bay of Pigs, and had ties to the Mafia!  Now, I could be wrong, but JFK's campaign sounds like a true selling of the President.  'Selling of the President' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays Left Wing propaganda of the 1960s	neg
"The Passion of the Christ - Songs" is a fine collection of great songs, each in their own way a reaction to the spectacular film that Mel Gibson has created. The standouts are the song "I See Love" by Steven Curtis Chapman, Third Day an MercyMe; Scott Stapp's powerful solo debut song "Relearn Love;" "Rainy Day" by Big Dismal, and the emotional "New Again" by Brad Paisley and Sarah Evans.  Despite a couple of songs that don't reach their true potential ("The Passion," and "How Many Lashes"), this is a fine CD that belongs in anyone's and everyone's Christian music collection. Grade: A-	pos

I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc.  However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance.

I am a six foot tall women with large size ribs and medium chest and this backpack fits me very well.  As I am large and this pack fits me, I would think this would ajust to a small person well.  I especially like all the padding on the surface that meets your back.  I hike hills up to two hours with my seven month old (19 lbs) in the pack without problems.  The built in shade cover is great as you dont have to put it on and off as needed.  The pack is very comfortable for both of us.  The interior of the pack also adjusts for the baby size and as mine grows taller, I can drop him lower in the pack.  I looked at many other more expensive packs as I thought they would be better fitted out, but this pack has all the features I wanted for a lower price.  I highly recommend this pack.	pos

I purchased this camera from Amazon recently.  The FIRST time around, the camera tape door wouldn't shut the very first time I opened it.  I returned the camera and Amazon was great about replcing it promptly.  The SECOND time around, the DV port worked once, and ONLY once.  There's a short in it.  There is a REASON this camera is so cheap.  It's J U N K!!  I will add that a friend of mine is on her second JVC as well.  A fact I did not know until all of this came about.   ---  --- For two stars, I'll say the video quality is good.  The camera battery does hold a full 60 min. charge.  I had NO sound issues what so ever.  Background noise?? none here. --- As for still pictures, if you don't know what you're doing as far as shutter speeds, back light, etc. FORGET IT.  The still pictures are very grainy.  If you want professional looking stills, do NOT buy a camcorder for this purpose. ---  --- JVC tech support is USELESS. ---  --- Camcorder comes with a USB wire to upload still only.  As on ANY digital camcorders, you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port.  You need a firewire.  This does not come with one.  Also, you need to check if you HAVE a firewire port on your computer. ---  --- I paid app. $25 dollars here on Amazon including shipping, for a port and firewire.  It took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower.  It's no big deal. ---  --- Amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time, only refund my money.  This camera is now listed as $30 cheaper than when I bought it last month.   ---  --- Overall, AMAZON was great about service and return, however, this particular JVC item is JUNK	neg

When I got my hands on the PMC-120 I thought this was going to to be the best player but when I started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way. --- I agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it.  --- MUSIC: --- When I tried to put music in my PMC it syncronized  my mp3s with the WMP 10 with no problem (very fast). If U are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device, this is not for you because when I did  it got everything in one same folder that read "Unknown artist and album". So you have to put all your mp3s via WMP 10, wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. The problems that I encountered is that it only has one "Portable playlist"  and sometimes when Im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button. --- One cool thing is that it shows the cd covers  without having to put them in. This is done via the WMP10. --- The sound is very good and crisp, and the equalizer setups are fair.But you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound. ---  --- PICTURES: --- This is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. You can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a PC to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you. ---  --- VIDEO: --- Ok, now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me... --- I wanted a portable media device that I would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid.  I knew that this device only reads WMV but it "supports" DIVX, XVID, MPEG, etc. This "support" deppends on what the WMP10 can play. So this means that you sincronyze (via WMP10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into WMP movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your PMC secreen size.  I had this in mind when I bought it and was fine with me untill I tried it the first time: The WMP10 wouldnt convert my XVID movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that I had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the WMP10. So after uninstalling and installing I was good to go so I converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes.  But this short moment of joy  was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the WMP10 fits the widescreen movies into the PMC and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! You cant change this because the WMP does this automatically.  My answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into WMV files. The problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...I have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the WMP10. --- In the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the WMP10 and it does it very fast and with good quality. --- You can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so I think this option is useless on the PMC. ---  --- So the veredict is: The PMC-120 is a good  multimedia player with minor glitches. It is a little bulky but personally I think the size is not that big. I think the good side of the size issue comes along with its  big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video.  --- If you want to play directly your DIVX or XVID movies on your player buy another porduct like the iRiver PMP series or the Archos players wich are way, way, WAY more expensive. --- So I think that for the price and for what it does the PMC-120 gets two thumbs up.	pos
Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.  ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review  ---  --- 	pos
I was really looking forward to this game, and I was prepared to overlook one or two things.  Every game has it's own personality, right?  I found instead this game actually doesn't have much of one at all.   ---  --- I didn't mind the graphics.  Not cutting edge sure, but not that bad either.  A little muddy but a change from cartoony.  It was hard to enjoy closeup views, however, when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom.  No way to toggle that feature.  The camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately.   ---  --- Not that there was much time to look at the scenery.  Immigrants came.  And came.  And came.  Whether there were houses and jobs available or not.  As long as city happiness was high enough, which meant that everyone was happy.  Which they were not.  Because they had no houses or jobs.   ---  --- To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy.  Forget planning.  Forget balancing resources with workshops and markets.  It wasn't clear what the balance was in any case.  It would take trial and error, and you didn't have the time.  For you were building worshops like mad, trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each, and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves.   ---  --- The best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade.  It was through research, maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on.  You hit those early on, and reached a certain population level, you made money.  The rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving.  There was no stability in reaching any level.   ---  --- It quickly became a game of keep up.  There was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development.  And for all the decorative options, more than the similar games out, you really didn't care in the end what your city looked like, because it just cost time.  Money too, but that was really not the relevant issue.  Unless people were unhappy.  Then you could stick a few things, quickly, somewhere.  You just can't enjoy a leisurely pace of planning, building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run...you have to be constantly involved in the process, staying ahead of the curve.  You don't have to worry about maintenance, such as city fires or engineers, but the cities cannot not be made self-sufficient or self-sustaining with this inherent instability built into the gameplay.  Five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities, if not all, to a screeching halt. ---  --- While I enjoyed the research options, and the ability to move homes I thought was a great innovation, not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the gameplay ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying.	neg
Does the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important. --- Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO	neg
The way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers, and filled with sand, for weight, AT THE BOTTOM -  the part you DON'T punch. ---  --- I was wondering why it felt like I was punching a brick wall on the left side: that's where they stuck the bags of sand. Just what a fighter needs before a fight (or anyone needs at any time of their life) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock. ---  --- This is a clear defect: I am considering returning it. Not sure if they're all like this, but I assume mine is not unique. Can't find where it says it was manufactured, but in this day and age, and based on the "craftsmanship", it's reasonable to assume China. Hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in Missouri! ---  --- Mine also suffered a little damage during shipping: the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed. It usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it's own. ---  --- Hey, it's hit or miss when you order online, particularly with oversized items, as far as shipping an "handling" are concerned. The shipping box was damaged and oil stained, the product poorly constructed. So, I'd call this a "miss"	neg

We bought this for my 6 y/o daughter to go with the X-Box we bought for Christmas.  We have not owned a game system except for a game-boy since the original Nintendo came out.  This game has been fun for us all. We all play at the same time, which makes for some family fun. My daughter is able to play some alone without getting too frustrated and does well when we all play.  Personally I enjoy the comedic elements that have been well thought out.  If you are a hard core gamer you will probably get bored of it quickly.  It may not be as challenging as you like.  We have gotten over half way through without a cheat book, which is amazing for most games.  	pos
This product is overpriced.  I found 11 oz. bags of this at the local grocery store for $3.49, which is 31.7 cents/oz.  This gives $12.22 for the 38.5 oz. bag featured here.  And there ordinarily would be a further discount for buying it in a larger size bag.  The candy is good, but it seems better to look for it in your local store	neg
I love this product.  I use it when my son spits up and it either goes on his face or body.  Sometimes it still stinks from the spit up after wiping with just a wipe so I pump a little of this on a wipe and it does the trick.  I have various Mustela products and they all work great	pos
Sometimes I like to look up and see what I can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70's and Starz being one of them. I was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78. Another band that took time for their fans!!!!!!! --- I read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that I can add, also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music. I would recommend reading about each of the Starz cd's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself........ I remember I liked this cd so much and the logo as well, I even hand- made a stencil and made my own Starz shirt, I think I used some of that gold "glue on glitter" in a tube and had one of the first Starz shirts, before the band even had any if I remember right. --- Lots of good songs on this cd,  Pull the Plug being one of my favorites both on the LP/CD and live. All good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more......... --- I could go on trying to describe the music.......... too bad there are no sound files for this cd....... so you may just have to order it and take a chance. The remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player Richie Ranno continues to be active in the music business, you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated and see what Richie and the band are up to. Singer Michael Lee Smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into Hollywood....... but this is about Starz!!!...So.... I highly recommend checking out the CD's and starzcentral. Not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from Europe that is using the name recently	pos

I subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in PDF form. I was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them. Frankly I was disappointed. The reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis, (the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book). Reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review... Please. They are also fairly out of date. Most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while. Some titles aren't available anywhere that I can figure. Whats the point in reviewing an audio title you can't find? ---  --- My interest is primariy sci-fi, horror and romantic-horror. Most of the titles audiofile reviews are fiction. The articles aren't particularly interesting. Frankly I could care less what the narrator thinks or feels, as long as they have a good voice. There is also a sort of...Literay snob tone to audiofile. I get the feeling they like certain authors and certain titles and tend to overly focus on them.  ---  --- I'd really like to see audiofile have a 'coming soon' review column. It would be very useful to know what titles will be coming out in the future. I'd also like to see more romance, dark fantasy, and horror reviews, or at least make the section focusing on different genres a little more clear. I also think the sections focussing on children's titles and self-help are a little large.  ---  --- 2 stars. If you must subscribe, get the online version. That way you can cancel anytime, and don't have to worry about subscription problems	neg

I first picked up a copy of Nylon in Chicago, while browsing the newsstands. I wasn't sure if I would like it--years of subscribing to Vogue, Elle, and some stupid tweeny magazines had almost put me off magazine-reading for good. And yet I always manage to be drawn to the racks. ---  --- Nylon was different from the get go. They always feature unknowns on the cover, and when, on occassion, a well-known celebrity is featured, the stories give us a new perspective on them.  ---  --- Nylon is worth purchasing for the layout in itself. I could spend hours paging through each feature, marveling at the graphics, and the way the magazine is put together. I love how they base some of the beauty section on famous movies or bands. ---  --- Nylon also makes a point of covering bands, movies, and fashion designers that, until now, have remained obscure. Everything they feature is amazing--most of the music they recommend ends up on my Amazon wishlist! ---  --- I would highly recommend Nylon to anyone and everyone. This obscure magazine will stun you with its amazing artistic layout, and introduce you to new products you may have never discovered	pos

The legendary Howard Hawks directed this WWII classic about the Mary Ann, a B-17 bomber lead by Captain John Ridgely and featuring crew members Gig Young, Harey Carey, Arthur Kennedy, Charles Drake, George Tobias, Ray Montgomery, and John Garfield.  On a routine mission to Hawaii, the crew arrives just hours after the Pearl Harbor attack and find themselves thrust into war.  Other stops include Wake Island and the Philippines. Of course, one of the purposes of this film was to rally the American spirit, and it features some of the anti-Japanese dialogue you'd have to expect.  But the film succeeds beyond the propaganda value.  The action sequences are well filmed and exciting, with terrific aerial action and some good ground sequences, too.  The camraderie amongst the crew is credible.  Each member has his own small "back story" as you would expect, but these fine character actors make it all very believable (Harry Carey is a particular standout).  This film is a true WWII classic	pos

They're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit "flatter" in person than they do in the picture.  I'm not blaming Amazon or Silver Insanity for it since they've done nothing wrong.  Products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles.  I just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings.  And yes, they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply, but not so big that they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy.  They're very nice. 	pos

This was the best therapy game ever.  My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games.  We mostly played it with their friends.   I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me.  I decided to bring it to a family gathering.  I have always been distant with my eight siblings.  The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect.  then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played.  We had a total awakening of how we see each other.  We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful.  This game is the best.  We laughed so hard we ached the next day.  We played till 2:00 a.m.  Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home.  We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL  I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together	pos
I have to clarify this is NOT THE SAME as YOUTHFUL ESSENCE. --- IT does NOT work the same and the product is NOT the same.  I MUST clarity that...

 I THOUGHT MY FIRST ISSUE OF YOUR MAGAZINE WAS A LITTLE SPARSE. IT WAS A VERY THIN ISSUE. THE MODELS WERE BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS GOOD.BUT YOU KNOWIF YOU WOULD INCLUDE MORE IN DEPTH ARTICLESSUCH AS REALLY IN DEPTH STUFF ABOUT SKIN AND HAIR. LIKE I SAID BEFORE AGING SKIN NEEDS MORE DONE TO IT AND SOME THINGS LIKE MICRO-DERMABRASION COULD BE HELPFUL. ALSO 8 GLASSES A WATER A DAY IS THE MOST HELPFUL THING A WOMAN COULD DO FOR HERSELF. BESIDE PLASTIC SURGERY,THERES NOT MUCH FOR THEM TO DO. BUT I WILL SAYTHIS, TO ENLARGE LIPS I PUT A VITAMIN E CAPSULE ON MY LIPS, AND THEN HONEY AND THEN A GOOD LIP MOISTURIZER AND LEAVE IT ON OVERNIGHT. IT DOEES MAKE THE LIPS PLUMPER. ALSO I USE BABY POWDER ON MY FACE AS A FACE POWDER. SOMETIMES I USE THIS JUST ON MY NOSE AND CHIN. SOMETIMES I USE HALF MAYONAISE AND  CONDITIONER AND MIX THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THE MAYONAISE SMELL BETTER ON THE HAIR. SOMETIMES I USE VITAMIN OIL IN MY BATH WATER SUCH AS VITAMIN E A PERSON CAN BUY THIS AT THE DOLLAR STORE.  IM NOT RICH BUT I DO SOME THINGS TO HELP THE WAY I LOOK AT  MY AGE. THEN YOU COULD INCLUDE PICTURES OF MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND STORIES OF PEOPLE .  THEN YOU COULD HAVE ARTICLES ON CELEBRITIES LIKE FRANK CONVERSE,ROBERT BLAKE,REALLY INTERESTING ONES LIKE THAT. PAUL NEWMAN HAS ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY INTERESTING. ALSO WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ACTOR RICHARD HATCH WHO STARRED IN THE HITCHHIKERS?  someone told  me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner. i didnt see that as i should. i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great. i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i   really like too beacause women do like these women. i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him. yes there is people like that still in the world. ive found some of them. well thank you	pos
I first purchased this watch in 1994 when I entered the selection coarse to be an Air Force CCT.  I lost the watch years later but I would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck.  I now work for US DOJ and will be deployed to Baghdad for a while and I need a watch I will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions.  This is the only watch I will ever own.  I cannot say enough about it.  Maybe I'm sentimental but I love this watch	pos
We had bought one of these for this house, loved it so much we bought one for the other house, too.  The original one was bought w/ the 22" wok, which is gorgeous.

I've dealt with all other kinds of pocket notebooks, all of which fold, deform, get pages easily folded over and ripped out and stained.

I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does. ---  --- Don't waste your money, and don't make EA any more richer, its obvious they just throw these games together.  They just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank. 	neg
Excellent product, easy to mount and the clarity of the mirror is great	pos
 --- I have played all the rpgs, Baldur's Gate, NWN, Dungeon Siege, Final Fantasy, TOEE, etc. ---  --- And I have to say, that stumbling upon Icewind Dale 2 was a real treat.. ---  --- Sure the graphics are dated, but WOW..the storyline, the dialogue, the descriptions of the rooms and actions are all incredibly well written (A breath of fresh air, after playing DS). The quests don't get in the way of the game, like so many others that get bogged down in annoying side-quests as a lame attempt to flesh out the world.  I would have prefered the game to be turn based like TOEE, but this game's battles are numerous and really fun; partially to good monster design..compare bugbears in this game to NWN..so much better, and partially to the unforgettable situations and dungeons.  ---  --- When pitted against other D&D ruleset games, the spell choices offered and levels they are given at is superior to all others.  I actually enjoyed having a Druid in my party, who could transform his arms into pythons, and for the first time in CRPG history actually used summon animals spells. Even if many spells were simular to other games, these felt more tailored to the characters and made useful, instead of waiting till higher levels to get one useful spell. ---  --- My favorite part is that I could handpick my team, where as in Baldur's Gate I was forced to play with characters I didn't like, or NWN where it was removed and tedious to interact with henchmen. --- I enjoyed RPing the characters backgrounds, and interactions in my head, and really enjoyed finding the treasure, unique to  IWD2, like a wide variety of cut gems. (which became an addiction) ---  --- If you updated this game graphically to the level of TOEE, and made it Turn Based with battle tactics, It would be my all time favorite RPG	pos

Oh PLEASE - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 Masterpiece Theater TV series of 'Cousin Bette' do so and make it available on DVD.   This was one of THE finest shows ever created for television.  Truly, it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now, 40+ years later, I fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to DVD.  For the sake of one of the theater (and humanity's) most glorious theatrical efforts, PLEASE make the original TV version available!  (BTW - I rate the ORIGINAL item at 5+ STARS!	neg
with games such as Grand theft auto: San Andreas, driv3r,true crime, etc. the competition is fierce and a game like this won't cut it. first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for $6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner. i saw it at EB games for only $5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a "greatest hit" play GTA or true crime instea	neg

Being a PC user for many years (since 1985)I have come through all the versions of MS operating systems (does anyone out there remember 3.5!) MS has also piggy backed this "robust" office product for 20 years.  Their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar.  This is no exception, but this time I like the tool bar!  As to ease of use, I use PowerPoint and Word often and my spouse uses Excel.  If there were an easier product available we would buy it but then Windows XP would kill it on sight and Vista would stop working altogether.  Why does MS think that everyone but those working in a professional since (hence Office for Professionals) needs all the junk they subject us to?  Do those guys in Redmond still think adult users of the PC like "cute" things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question!  I am tired of Beta testing MS products for so many years but as a PC user I am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system, other than Mac, we are all stuck with them. 	neg

I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!	pos

Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.

Overall, this is the best gaming magazine I have read.  It covers all consoles, gives sensible (and funny) reviews, and previews the hottest upcomming games.   ---  --- Most games are reviewed by two people, adding to the accuracy of the score.  It has a rating of 1-10, 10 being the best, a rating which precious few games recieve.   ---  --- The previews section gives you a sneek peek of upcomming games.  Some of them are one page long, some ten.  They all include pictures, and most have an estimated release date. ---  --- Also, there is a section on news in the game industry.  Ususlly near the beginning of the magazine, they include news on developers, consoles, and the big names in the industry.   ---  --- All in all, this is a great magazine, and well worth your money, because each issue is well over 100 pages	pos
I bought the Rebel XT w/ the 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before the XTI was introduced, but that's another story. As this is my first DSLR, I was blown away by the results. But after the initial euphoria, there is always room for improvement. My first choice was the 28-200, favoring the longer zoom over the IS, but I found this one used at Penn Camera and got a deal on it and a 380EX flash, so the decision was made for me.  --- I like the zoom range, it's great for framng portraits. If I need wider angle, I still have the kit lens.  --- I won't make the usual complaints about the herky-jerky zoom ring or the rackety extension tubes, as I was prepared for this by these reviews before I ever saw the lens. --- I'm no expert on sharpness, and still trying to get myself dialed in, but my shots so far look pretty sharp to me. I have no "L" lenses to compare to, nor would I make the comparison if I did.  --- In my somewhat uninformed opinion, this is a great step up from the kit lens. This is a lens a working guy can afford and most likely get great results with. Being a working guy, I'm extremely happy with it so far, and glad I made the purchase. 	pos
My twin sister bought these for me, and initially I thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable.  ---  --- Breaking them in wasn't so hard - although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first.  ---  --- But now, they feel stable, comfortable and easy to walk it. They feel perfectly balanced and I've never experiance blisters in these shoes.  ---  --- Two thumbs up	pos
We've had a number of Gazillion bubble machines.  --- The first - this one, with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well, but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses.  (Granted, one of those uses was for a few hours).  When the level of liquid is low, the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand.   ---  --- We replaced it the next year with the Typhoon machine - this was awesome, produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands, no matter how low the supply of liquid.  It has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though.   ---  --- Our issue now is getting the liquid.  Gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well, etc. etc. etc.  HOWEVER, very few stores stock the liquid, and except for when I first bought the first machine, no-one stocks large size bottles.  Even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them, never have them in stock (I've been on their notify list for a long time!)  I've ended up buying from someone in Canada on eBay - otherwise, buying the smaller bottles at ToysRUs, Target, etc. is just too expensive.   ---  --- Both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles.  ---  --- We're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us.  Otherwise, the machines are useless now. 	neg
I'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy.  However, despite annoying design features, this is quite an amazing piece of software!  I would certainly rate it a 5+ if there weren't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ;) ---  --- For starters, the educational intent of this software was well thought out.  Young people will certainly learn a lot about chess through using this program and they will have tremendous fun doing it!  The game teaches fairly advanced concepts in very clever and engaging ways for children of all ages and even adults. ---  --- The graphics and characters are great.  The explanations of principles are sound and they are reinforced through fun chess exercises.  The program encourages young chess players and at the same time challenges them to improve. ---  --- The product description above covers the scope of the concepts covered in detail and I found this description to be accurate so I won't repeat it.  I spent about 2 hours with a 9 year old playing the game and I had a lot of fun! ---  --- I didn't find that this program was especially difficult to use and my young friend was able to figure it out intuitively.  He also found it difficult to pull himself away and so did I.  This definitely an activity you can enjoy along with your children. ---  --- The overall concept for this teaching tool is interesting because it involves three layers of play.  There is the overall game of rescuing the king who is trapped in the castle which is used as a tool to motivate the player to learn new chess skills that allow them to progress in this higher order game.  Embedded within this larger framework are a number of clever chess teaching games where you can record high scores and learn various skills.  These can be selected from within an animated room, which gives the player some freedom of choice.  Additionally, there are other fun games that are not necessarily related to chess, but that allow the player to relax their chess concentration and refresh themselves for tackling more difficult chess skills challenges. ---  --- I also think it's good that kids could join [...] for a year and play against others as part of the purchase price.  This gives them an arena to apply their chess knowledge and is a good community that is always available.  There are other online chess communities that are free, but I still think this is a nice added bonus. ---  --- I don't think any parent could go wrong purchasing this software for their child.  It's good for hundreds or even thousands of hours of entertainment and its powered by an excellent chess engine.  However, you can't play a game of chess against the computer with it.  It is ONLY a teaching tool.  However, you can buy Fritz Grandmaster Software for about [...] which does have this capability at a very low price point compared to other products of comparable playing ability.  I've heard criticisms of Fritz 9 and my understanding is the extra cost does not add a lot of value.  In fact, at this point there seems to be some bugs with Fritz 9. ---  --- If you purchase this product, you won't be disappointed.  I wish they had it when I was learning to play chess	pos
As a pretty big comedy fan thanks to XM radio, i have listened to a lot of comics and I own a lot of comic CD's (Mitch Hedberg, Bill Hicks, Emo Philips, Lewis Black, Steven Wright, Pablo Francisco etc.) and my absolute favorite is Unprotected.  There is not a slow part on this CD and it never fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride.  His quick and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the US.  His family must be very understanding since he doesn't hesitate to include every detail of their personal lives in his act, but it all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to.  The highlights of this CD are his daughter's boyfriend and guidelines for resuming sex after a heart attack.  I highly highly reccomend this	pos
I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequil (sp?) to this game and did not know what to expect.  --- I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why: --- The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than "NBA Street" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournements and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them.  --- I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you	neg

I was unsure about this company so I only popped for a week subscription, felt the gamble of $10 was worth it.  Well not all gambles work out, this one did not.  When you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you have, now one might think once you do this that the information you want to access will be about your particular vehicle, not so.  I want to know how to replace a certain part, well you go to that part look it up, it tells you the replacement procedure for a car not even yours, and nothing about your car, uh!! C'mon.  ---  --- There's very little trobleshooting, no flow charts for troubleshooting. --- Save you money and buy a Haynes Manual for your vehicle, you'll be much farther ahead.  	neg

If you are expecting "Safari Moon Pt. 2", you will be dissapointed. Air took a more adventuourous, darker, ambient, serious, experimental, and ultimtately brilliant journey into electronic music. The songs here range from sounding like Aphex Twin (without the weird off-putting effects or heavy drums) to Thievery Corp. Air still has a beautiful sense of melody and as usual the tunes themselves are beautifully and creatively put together (even a throwaway Air song is a well-crafted one). Overall, all us true hardcore Air fans love this album. Those who only loved MS may not like it, but that's their loss I say	pos
Edmund O'Brien is a CPA who decides to get away to San Francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats (and also to get away from his secretary who's nagging him to marry her). There he's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why. The trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing. Following this trail is a bit confusing for O'Brien and the audience. But the picture is tightly directed and well acted. A highly regarded film-noir entry, and rightly so. Worth a watch	pos
I'm usually a very skeptical person and I don't trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time. But these vitamins actually do work. It takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work. So if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results. The only thing I hate about the product is the price. But if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you're in luck. I'm young and I don't have alot of money so I can't buy these vitamins all the time. But if you have a steady cash flow then you're in luck and they will totally help you	pos

Ever since my son was 10 months old he just HAD to check out the vacuum whenever it was out. So we decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday. Since we use a canister vacuum I wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well, and this was pretty much the only one out there.  ---  --- He just LOVES it, and since he is under 3, (the recommended age), I took the long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size. (the head fits fine straight onto the hose.) He knows how to turn it on & off, but mostly likes dragging it around. He also likes taking the two attachments out. And I love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one.  ---  --- The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it EVERYWHERE. And that can be a pain- (to the car, in the highchair, on the changing table, etc.) so I've had to hide it sometimes. :) But I am very happy with this vacuum	pos
This is a quality heavy duty grill cover.  When you pay good money for a Weber Grill you want it to stay looking good.  Don't go buy one of those cheap Walmart covers for $10.  It will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two.  This cover wasnt cheap, but by the looks of it...it should last a long time	pos

I purchased this along with a Sony DCRHC21.  This Carry case was listed as an accesory so I expected it to be appropriately sized (as other Sony cases I've purchased fit like a glove).  This  case is entirely too large to hold a miniDV camcorder.  The camcorder rattles around inside it.  If you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one.  Otherwise I suggest you look at the Product Specifications, note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder's size. 	neg

I agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status.  That being said - I spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Well worth the cost and enjoyable.  I am not familiar with the other Civ games - and was looking more for a city building game set in the past, similar to my favorite game Children of the Nile - perhaps that explains why I was not disappointed	pos
I purchased "Empty" not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable, but eventually forgettable, pop/rock.  This sophomore effort is, simply put, amatuer and sub-par.  Some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as "Empty" B-sides, while the cover of "Electric Avenue" never really distracts most listeners from thinking "What is this and why?"  Over all, this might appeal to most Christian radio listeners, but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise	neg
Snapfire and Snapfire Plus are new photo software from Corel. Snapfire was recently released as a free download and Snapfire Plus is a budget priced upgrade which adds more advanced features. ---  --- The one thing consumers ask for the most is a photo software that is easy to learn and use. Corel's answer is Snapfire's Message Center. From this one window, you can keep up with the latest news, updates and specials. More importantly, you have easy access to many tips and tutorials. ---  --- Snapfire has automated photo downloading from your camera, memory card or CD. Just plug in one of these and the Photo Downloader automatically starts. You can set download options for how it works. Snapfire will automatically rotate your photos when needed, check for and download only the photos added since the last download and automatically delete the photos from your camera after downloading them to the folder of your choice on your hard drive. ---  --- Once your photos are downloaded, you can use Quick Review to view photos in full screen mode and use the floating toolbar for tasks such as adding photo information, ratings and captions or starting Photo Fix. Snapfire's Photo Doctor analyzes your photos and makes suggestions for Quick Fix. With Photo Fix, you can pan, zoom and make corrections such as brightness, contrast and focus. Other photo adjustment features, which are similar to those included in Corel's popular Paint Shop Pro, include Fix Red Eye, Rotate and Crop (with a floating toolbar). Other features borrowed from Paint Shop Pro include easy-to-use organizing with Sort by, Search and Calendar Search. Snapfire also has ways to enhance your photos including Black & White and Sepia color effects. ---  --- The Photo Tray is a really nice feature which you can use to drag and drop your photos into a common location, grouping them together for a project, emailing to family and friends or printing. Snapfire has a really cool and special way to email photos. Its called Snapfire Show. After you select the photos you wish to send, Snapfire will automatically create a slide-show with built-in transitions, music and motion effects. Your photos are resized and embedded into the body of the email or added as an attachment. ---  --- Printing your photos is easy and fool-proof with the built-in layouts including standard 4 x 6, 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 3.5 x 5, wallet size and contact sheets. Snapfire will automatically use your default printer settings or you can change the settings or printer as needed. If you choose to order prints online instead, you can do so with one click of your mouse and the Photo Upload dialog box. ---  --- You can also use Snapfire to work with your videos. Just click on a video's thumbnail to view and edit the video in full screen mode. You can even grab a frame from your video and convert it into a photo. For crafters, Snapfire has several built-in project templates for album pages, greeting cards, calendars and collages. Creating a project is as easy as dragging your photos onto the template and using the basic tools to make adjustments, add text captions and position photos. ---  --- A trial version of Snapfire Plus (SE) comes packaged with the newest upgrade of Paint Shop Pro Photo XI or can be downloaded from the Corel website	pos

I have been taking acustic guitar lessons for 6 years now. I decided to buy this to try and learn to play the electric guitar I recieved as a gift. It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons.	pos

I got this CD after seeing what I remembered as a decent video on Fuse TV.  Maybe I was half-asleep, because after listening to this ho-hum entry into the world of emo copycats, I can't even remember or recognize which song it was.

This is my first and very expensive entry into digit SLR photography. --- I have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously. ---  --- I was avoiding DSLR's because I used to rarely use my EOS film SLR. --- The convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming. --- Unfortunately so are it's limitations. ---  --- So back I came, and the only choice though expensive was the EOS 5d for it's full frame sensor! The pain was reduced by the double rebates. ---  --- Wow! This is a revelation! Beautifull images, lot of control. ---  --- I did notice that the AF was not as fast as my old Elan IIE. ---  --- I was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing. I am not happy with canon for this, but I really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned. ---  --- This camera also needs prime or L lenses, because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses. This add's to the cost. ---  --- This is an exceptional photographic tool that I hope to use to improve my skill as I explore all it's capabilities	pos
A brilliant remake of the original classic! Although I am an avid fan of the first DOOM...I strongly urge you to NOT juxtapose the two. If you sit back and pick apart the differences between them, you'll never enjoy DOOM 3.  ---  --- Why is this game well worth the buy? Many reasons. Superb graphics is the first that you'll notice. The environment is rich and detailed. Don't worry about whether or not your computer can handle it. You can easily build one that is easily capable at running the game with full settings for less than $900...and if you're comp is so old that you can't run it like this...you may have been due for an upgrade anyways.  ---  --- The weapons are great and very realistic. Like the real world, your arsenal must be reloaded after so many rounds are fired. A handy pair of digits will help you monitor your clip and total ammo for any weapon though. So, plan ahead and keep your guns fully loaded.  ---  --- As for the endless series of hallways that some people are complaining about...it makes absolutely no sense to have a stadium set up on a Mars Research Base. The game offers plenty of larger rooms to adequately utilize heavier weapons such as the rocket launcher without blowing your own face off. ---  --- The ambient sounds of the game are more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Dead bodies will randomly levitate and fly across the room, grates will be knocked around be unseen forces and Betruger's haunting laugh will often accompany many of these ghostly actions and more. ---  --- The enemies are fierce, the enemies are bad (as in fearful), any one of them can go from easy to kill to downright lethal. You may not get very many good looks at them, but you really shouldn't be trying to admire the pixels of something that's trying to kill you. Take a screenshot and look at that later if you want to take in what the monsters look like. Experiment with your arsenal...learn the best weapon for the job and conserving ammo won't be a problem at all.  ---  --- The big issue that most people seem to have is that of lighting. Yes, in the 22nd century you'd expect Marines to have lights mounted on their weapons. ID Software isn't stupid...a flashlight on all of your guns would have made the game a lot easier and a lot less fun. By switching from your light to your gun...the game forces you to choose between being able to see the enemy and being able to attack the enemy. Remember, this game is of the "Horror" genre. And horror thrives on you asking questions like "Where is it? What is it? Where is it gonna pop out at next?" Go rent a horror movie and you'll see what I mean. It's dark! DOOM 3 is meant to be like this.  ---  --- Buy the game...or borrow it from a buddy. Turns the lights off and turn the volume up. If you like horror...it will pull you right in. 	pos

If you are familiar with the work of Strobel, this book will continue to impress you.  If you are not however, and would like to know where the author is coming from, I encourage you to read his previous works, "The Case for Christ" and "The Case for Faith" so that you might better understand Strobel. ---  --- Some people have condemned this book because Strobel doesn't present the evolutionary side well.  I have a few quick observations to make.  First of all, he's a journalist; he asks tough questions and, for the most part, gets good responses.  Second, everyone has an agenda, without exception.  Strobel, and those who he interviews, analyze and break down the views of prominent evolutionists and modern Darwinian scientific views.  Finally, it is clear from the outset that Strobel wants to make a compelling case for ID.  This is not an unreasonable goal.  The fact that he doesn't interview evolutionists shouldn't bother anyone, based on his obvious objectives.  If you want a book that allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into a point-counter point series book.  If you want to understand the current ID debate and would like to get a real good look at some of the cosmological evidence for a creator, this book is for you	pos
This is an example of a large company pertpetrating fraud on the people who buy its products.  --- I bought my son an iPod for Christmas.

You'll never read this in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and NG is all the poorer for it.  P.J. O'Rourke is never politically-correct and he visits places on the planet from which most people would like to escape...the result is a spot on, razor sharp, keenly observed travelogue that is side-splittingly funny, in a tragic sort of way.  O'Rourke has a wonderful way of spotting irony, silliness, and official absurdity, and letting all of the air out of pompous, ill-conceived notions.  In short, he is the UN's worst nightmare.  For anyone who has travelled or ever interacted with any government agency anywhere--especially our own--this book is a must read	pos
We just bought this for our 3 year old. --- I do not at all understand why it is labled for 5 and over!! --- Cute game idea-  --- But this was not well put together. --- First I about died when I saw the super cheap, barely cardboard gameboard!!!!!!! It is a VERY small board, set up like a 4 piece puzzle, that I predict will barely stay together after a few plays.   --- the jewelery, subpar.  the crown and rings are OK, the rest very cheap and plain.  But is serves it purpose just fine :).   --- I give this low marks for educational and durablity. --- BUT the jewlery box and spinner are a nice & durable!! If they put the same effort into the WHOLE game it may be worth buying. --- My daughter DID enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game.	neg
I found this to be a fun game as well as effective.  I enjoyed the various activities and truly felt that several of them increased my concentration and  abilty to increase my speed.  I particularly like it when it got to the level where I could choose which games I wanted to use for my brain age tests.  Several of the games are going to require more repetitions before I become skillful at them.  I find that I continue working with the game instead of putting it down after a short time because of lack of interest. --- Carole Adan	pos

I have owned about 30 different harps, including 5 Lee Oskars.  The Lee Oskar is the best.  Sounds good too.  It bends easily when you want it to, and does not bend when you don't want it to.  If you don't know how to bend the notes, get a Lee Oskar and learn how.  Then you can bend notes on any of the others, but it is harder and does not sound as good.  If you pay attention to the videos, most  of the professionals use this brand.  If you are a beginner, buy this because it make you sound better	pos
I read a negative review of this show but I just watched it and it was better than foretold.  I expect it will do better than people think.  It's basically a Danielle Steele novel come to life.  Courtney Cox is a somewhat stern and enigmatic publisher of a Los Angeles gossip magazine. ---  --- The other characters are troubled celebrities (who have sex a lot).  The show feels very contemporary.  It is definitely a drama.  Despite moments of levity, it is basically a dramatic story.   ---  --- In any case, my bet is that this show will get better and that naysayers are jumping the gun. 	pos
Well, I just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product.  Can you even imagine her tooting?  She's too cute!  The slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends.  This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell.  One warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device.  Please use a real loud whistle.  You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid.  If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would most likely run the other way.  This whistle is for good times only. 	pos
I was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies, but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing.  --- I will not bore you with the reviews of these movies, those who love Akira Kurosawa movies sees the stories closely matching those of Shakespeare, a Clint Eastwood Western, and Star Wars. --- For the price and what you get, it's a steal	pos

The computer game version of The Number Devil closely follows the book, as kids progress through sections on prime numbers, the Fibonacci series, Pascal's triangle, and an infinite series approaching one.  Nine of the ten games worked well for us, but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth, the arrow game.  We understood the math, but couldn't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows.  This was disappointing, because we could never reach the bonus section.  All in all, though, this is a good investment for a child, 8 or up, who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers	pos

Like Stuart Gordon's other venture into science fiction territory, the underrated and ill-fated ROBOT JOX, this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor, which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience. Everyone joins in the fun in this one, with Dennis Hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog, Debi Mazar and Stephen Dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and Charles Dance having the time of his life with his horny half-metal madman. This Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the Director.	pos
This is a nice bag, but don't buy it for a Canon S2 IS it will not fit.  The product compatibility lists the S1 IS since the S2 and S1 are very similar I purchased this bag.

After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort	pos
Even though this is a receiver hitch mount item, it does not use a standard hitch pin.  It is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch (must be bolted into the hitch - to remove, must be unbolted). ---  --- This totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch - versatility: the ability to easily - without tools - change whatever is mounted in the hitch. ---  --- Bad Thule!

"The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" is highly recommended for any serious country music fan. If anyone is the genuine article, it is Jimmie. Listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including "Frankie and Johnny", "Mule Skinner Blues" and "T for Texas".  There are also fine versions of "Waitin' for A Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now" though some may prefer Jerry Lee Lewis' version of the former and the Webb Pierce recording of the latter. The most interesting tracks are less well known.  These include "My Old Pal", "My Old Sunny South by the Sea" and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-"Daddy and Home". For this reviewer, the album hit its high point on the final track, a mournful "TB Blues", a reference to the disease that took Jimmie's life at 35. While Jimmie's yodeling style may not be for everyone, this reviewer considers this album a safe bet.  Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Further, the "Essential" series of albums rarely disappoints. These almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. "The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" certainly falls into that category	pos
I used to love Outburn magazine. I first discovered it when I came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. The first thing I saw on the cover was VNV Nation. I bought that issue and soon after that I ordered a subscription. What I loved about Outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines, namely those in the goth, EBM, synthpop, and industrial scene. Unfortunately within the next year and a half, the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands, two genres I don't give a rat's behind about. I don't know WTF happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music I would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. Just like Alternative Press, Outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends	neg
I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space.  The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy.  The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all.  The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand.  Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over.  This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike.  Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx.  I used it on a men's road bike size 57.	neg
I've been a P&W subscriber and reader (even when not a subscriber) for years. I've also tried various other writers' magazines, such as The Writer and Writer's Digest. The latter two were fine when I was just beginning to dip into the freelance market, just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts, but when I gained more experience, I soon realized those just didn't make the cut anymore. The articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that I was no longer gaining new insights. P&W was the next step up.  ---  --- P&W provides advice, inspiration, informative interviews, current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer. The bimonthly issues include articles, detailed listings of markets, contests, grants, and helpful, relevant ads. For the price, this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more, staying up to date with what's rumbling in the literary world. With its up-to-date information, I've been able to leave the others aside, including that old bible, Writer's Market, which was, unfortunately, obsolete the moment it was off the presses.  ---  --- Highly recommended for the writer wanting more.  --- 	pos

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.  ---  --- So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.	neg

I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones.

I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products.

Stylish, comfortable, good sound quality...and utterly useless at noise cancelation. Great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat-side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes, and you'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight. Perhaps there's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box. I suggest you insist on this. Sure, turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise, but as far as I can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume.	neg
We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter.  We backed our vehicles out of the garage, and zoom....they were off having fun. ---  --- The box says "Ages 3+" and up to 55 pounds.  The bumper buggie looks small, but it is roomy enough for my 5 1/2 year old.  He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall.  He can stretch his legs out in the car, but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving.  My two year old can also work the controls. ---  --- It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy, but no more than other battery-operated vehicles. ---  --- I highly recommend this item.  It is so much fun!  Best part is that there is little assembly required.  The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car	pos
I love the taste of this hemp protein Powder.  I love to mush up bananas with a fork, add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the Nutiva Hemp seeds.

I couldn't believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving.  Considering that 90% of Americans are lacking in fiber, this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions	pos
This watch is beautiful.  I cannot say enough good things about this watchs design.  Its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy, it keeps perfect time and is very light weight.  I bought the Calibre 8700 before this one and I love both of them but I would give this one a slight edge.  My two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the Calibre 8700 does have, and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not Saphire.  I am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as Saphire crystal would be	pos

I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D. ---  --- The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good	neg
I've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil, which is vile to say the least.  The Crown Prince oysters are packed in olive oil -- a huge step up in health and taste.

The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times. ---  --- There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'. ---  --- Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice. ---  --- The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority. ---  --- In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day.	neg

Pardon me if I also wish to review anonymously. I now can come forward with my negative experience with the Seiko Black Monster too after seeing a handful of other ex-owners post theirs. I had my Seiko Black Monster SKX779K1 for about three weeks when it also did a freeze of all its movements and sounds. No sweep motion, no tick-tock of any sort. But unlike someone else's experience, mine never sprang to life anymore. AFter I shook it gently sideways to wind it up, its second hand moved for only about 10-12 seconds then stopped again. I did this "Watch CPR" several times but still always failed to resucitate it. My watch also was forming a light miss on the inside of its crystal a day after I used in while doing the dishes of all things. This is a divers watch? I already packed it up last Thursday for return and dropped it off at my local USPS, and Im still thinking whether to give it a chance and get another Black Monster or to get an entirely different model or brand. I must day that I am DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME in this watch! I loved the way it looked and it really made me felt bad to return it. But to me a watch is an instrument first, an accessory only second.	neg

I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use, and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose. ---  --- Pros: Easy on and off, even putting them on by yourself. Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design. ---  --- Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them	neg

Really. I've used the 'premium' blades and I've used the cheapo blades. All of them have done an adequate job but none of them could keep up with the kind of thundershowers which seem to blind you on the freeway worse than the thickest fog. That is, until I put Silblades on. The first time I ran into such a rain, I realized that much of what I had previously thought was "out there" was really right on my windshield, a result of inferior blades that simply could not keep up with the amount of water landing on the windshield. Like inferior tires, all of my previous blades (and yours, I'll bet) had effectively been 'aquaplaning' over my windshield, leaving a layer of water that was all but impossible to see through. It took Silbades to show me that a superior blade could improve the visibility through my windshield in 'blinding' rainstorms by 75% or more. For once I could see more than a blur in front of me as I drove the speed you have to in order to avoid getting rear-ended by other blinded drivers.  	pos
Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent.

I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor	neg

I had read a lot of reviews (here and elsewhere) warning of Final Cut's massive learning curve, and I do believe that helped soften the blow when I first tried this program. Because there definitely is a learning curve--this is far more complex than iMovie. But, the good news is, it's not beyond the newbie's reach! ---  --- I'm such a newbie with anything video, it's pitiful. I have only made two or three small movies in iMovie, and they weren't very sophisticated. I mostly just tinkered around. But, being the fool that I am, I decided that I wanted to get Final Cut Express to go along with the new camcorder I had just purchased. ---  --- Because I was prepared to have to re-learn (or struggle) at first with Final Cut, I had purchased a book (for version 2 of FCE, which was perfectly suitable). Armed with my book and limited expectations, I set about trying to make a fun little "music video" (using video clips and still pictures). Amazingly enough, I learned how to do the "Ken Burns Effect" with the pictures, make transitions from one clip to the next, edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video, then fade out for other parts. And I was able to fix the video clips (zoom in, lighten, change aspect ratio). And then I added titles with LiveText. All this in the first two days of using Final Cut!  Sure, the little video I made was no award-winner, but it was actually a servicable, fun little project that I wasn't too ashamed to show my friends. ---  --- (Another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips--there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that I tried with it. I had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions, but something always went wrong. Either the picture quality degraded terribly, or else the corrected dimensions didn't "stick" and it bounced back to being distorted. Nothing worked--until Final Cut. I'm sure that other programs could have done the same thing, but I tried so many, and failed. So that was another thing that impressed me!) ---  --- I know there's a whole lot more to learn about Final Cut, and I certainly don't anticipate that I'll become a master at it. But it does offer *a lot* more flexibility than iMovie, and it is definitely a lot of fun.  ---  --- The right way to approach it is, I believe, to start small, expect baby steps at first, have fun, and GET A BOOK! A book is absolutely essential. If you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day, this is not the application for you. Because you learn to "do it manually," you have much more control--but it takes time to learn it all. ---  --- Oh, a note about hardware: I made my first little video on a 1.25 GHz G4 Mac Mini with 512 megs of RAM. It wasn't a speed demon by any means, but because my video was short (about 2 minutes), it really wasn't too painfully slow most of the time (except for rendering, but I guess that was going to be slow anyway). I have since upgraded the Mini to 1 GB of RAM, and *everything* is snappier, so I highly recommend it. But it's good to know that even a little Mac Mini with less-than-impressive RAM can work in FCE.	pos
After seeing this in a magazine, I decided I had to try it so I ordered a small sized tub from Sephora.  OMG what an amazing change to my hair. ---  --- I am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that I then straightened because I hated it.  Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm my hair was getting a little sad. ---  --- This stuff is amazing. From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.   ---  --- I call it the "dirty hippy hair stuff" since it smells like incense. ---  --- I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. ---  --- If you don't want to pay the Sephora or QVC prices, buy it on ebay.  I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for	pos

I was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch, its almost 0.5in thick, and the bezel is a full 1.5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that.  The mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable, but the clarity is just average.  In addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers, it also has an Indiglo style back-light (which does work well).  The bezel only rotates counter-clockwise, and it seems very tight at first.  Overall, it's a decent everyday watch. 	pos

Add another E18 error code complaint to the list!  I purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the E18 error for about the last 2 months.

Save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer! 	neg

Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate. ---  --- So, if you are looking for a switch that will not be stored remotely in some closet, this is the one that will keep the peace in your office. A+ ****	pos
I bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f/1.8 Mark I (the version with the metal mount and distance scale) that I purchased recently.  Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens.  The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs.  The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption. ---  --- I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment:  well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep). ---  --- Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)	pos
There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20	neg
Unlike any other game you've ever played--in the best possible way. I am easily bored and/or grossed out by the traditional racing, shooting, killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change.  --- Challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time. Other reviewers have said it ends too soon, but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score. So, if you barely beat the level, you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water. Perfect for a pair of obsessive-compulsives like my fianc� and me.  --- He thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than I do AND his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it, too. There isn't anything that would be inappropriate for any age, but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it. (After he goes to bed we play the insanely gory Jaws game--you get to be the SHARK!!)  --- You might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast, but the King of All Cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises. The levels just get cooler and cooler. --- Also, the music is fantastic. It will have you singing along in no time.  Na na na na na na na na KATAMARI DAMASHI! It doesn't even make sense but I love it! --- I just ordered the second Katamari game, "We Love Katamari." `Nuff said.	pos

I've been using Apple's Macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability, which I consider THE most important aspect of an OS. ---  --- First off Tiger is a smooth running system (when it is smoothly running), and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around. The best dog-and-pony show around. That being said, WATCH OUT! ---  --- This OS is capable of completely hosing your user settings, all your software registrations, bookmarks, email settings, etc. The whole enchilada. ANY OS that can do that at the drop of a dime isn't worth the time. Since I use Disk Warrior, Cocktail and Disk Utility regularly, this should never have happened. I waited until the OS was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 -- apparently it is not yet ready -- best to wait another year before upgrading. Hopefully these bugs will be fixed	neg

This movie was cheeseball beginning to end...I thought the concept was corny even before I watched it but decided to give it a try anyway. Big mistake. A robot who can love? Lame! And with all this high tech stuff the docs can't bring the couple's real son out of a coma (or whatever was wrong with him) so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can 'love' but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone..Brialliant plan (especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world)..Then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin. The family decides they don't want the robot and the mom 'loves' him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of...It was then I knew I was smelling a stinker but NOOOOO someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth...I have since nicknamed it Artificial Idiocy...The worst part was the end, Ugh, I don't even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what I mean. The whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism. For those of you who have not seen it, I suggest renting it before you buy it. Maybe this movie is great for some people, it just wasn't my thing. 	neg
I like this for more than one reason...so read on, ---  --- Reason #1 - It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data, trust me this helps, when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone.  ---  --- Reason #2 - Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred, so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car. ---  --- You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone (Samsung Sync SGH-A707) in order to transfer files. MP3 and WMV/WMA formats work with this phone, i do not know whether other formats work or not. ---  --- Let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player. Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port (Preferably USB 2.0). If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My Computer on your computer. Now open Windows media player, you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu. From left to right you will be able to see in this order - Now Playing, Library, Rip, Burn, Sync, and Guide. Click on Sync. Make sure your Cell phone is connected, now you will see two halves in the same window, left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes (your cell phone name apears on the top), usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file, this takes a while. Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card, as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory. ---  --- Once you are well versed with what your phone can play, i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB reader/writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer, this saves you a chunk of time and battery power.	pos

I have had a Weber Silver B grill for several years.  The grill is great, but the steel flavorizor bars rust and have to be replaced (I replaced my bars twice in five years).  I have just started using the SS bars, but I am sure they will be better than the old bars, and well worth the extra initial cost.  If I had been able to get the SS bars earlier (not usually available from local markets), I probably would not have had to replace the bars as I did (twice).  I highly recommend spending the extra dollars for SS bars when the originals fall apart	pos
I'm really disappointed in this book, because the author seems to imply that you can have ANYTHING you want, but that is just not the case.  It's a deceptive title.   ---  --- I can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you; you're better off practising Feng Shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book (and I'm not knocking Feng Shui, I practise it myself).  People like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense.  In the end, you'll just feel worse off, looking for the "next big thing" to promise you some more snake oil. ---  --- Another fact I'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in CD format for around $60.00 (I got a flyer in the mail).  If he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called "secrets," doesn't that go against his own moral values?  One of the gimmicks of the CDs is that you can learn the secret sound of "creation," as if chanting "Ahhhh" is going to make everything alright.  Thanks to Dyer and others like him, I am completely against any sort of "positive thinking" Guru.  They are only after YOUR money (while you keep wishing you had more). ---  --- *Btw, you might be interested to know that after reading this book, you're only going to find out that the BIG CATCH is that Manifesting Your Destiny, according to the author, ONLY applies to spiritual matters.  Huh?  Yes.  The entire book promises you can have anything you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity.  The author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with "God's" plan, you don't have a chance either.  Thought I'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated! --- 	neg

Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of "Beyond Valley of the Dolls" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... "I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet." ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it	neg
I have owned several Ironman over the last 30 years or so and I have been pleased.  However, my last Timex watch had a twist of the dial control function and was a great disappointment as the dial became difficult to twist and finally the watch stopped working after only six months.  I was very disappointed in Timex and almost didn't buy this one.  This watch is the traditional men's Ironman, but smaller than I had purchased before and it fits nicely on my large wrist with plenty of band length. I have owned the new watch for three months with fairly rugged use and it functions great with easy to operate controls and it is very readable.  My wife and adult children tell me that it looks like a women's watch but I think they are used to oversized wathes that have been in style and I assure them that I am on the cutting edge of a new trend towards smaller (and more reasonally sized) wrist watches for men.  I am happy to say, that once again, I am very pleased with Timex.   	pos

I really like this protective cover.  It is very well made, and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall.  The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it.  Before I bought the ToughSkin, the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped.  Now that it is in the case, it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure.  It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it.  The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well.  The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect.  Overall, this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend	pos
Memorex changed the cases in this package, yet failed to reflect this on the packaging.  I purchased them at a local Office Depot.  It's the one with the patented hub that's supposed to protect your DVDs center.  Anyway, the two packages I got are no difference in comparison to regular cases I've gotten with sets I've bought.  I felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund	neg
I have Windows XP which came with McAfee. I used both Norton and McAfee but lately McAfee's updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble.  Rather than updating the anti-virus definitions, etc., I decided to try Zone Alarm where many users seem to like it.   ---  --- I must say that from the moment I installed it the only problem I ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus, firewall, etc. if ZoneAlarm is  to work.  To date the software has worked beautifully.   Actually, I believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster.  I definately would upgrade or buy this product again.  Check some of the sellers for the bargain prices.  I bought mine for 19.99, which is a big savings from the ZoneAlarm website.  It is worth every penny	pos
Let me tell you how wonderful these pens are: whenever I'm writing with another pen, I find myself longing for the Pilot V5. After writing with these for 7 years, there's just nothing else that compares. For me, the Pilot is the most conducive pen in getting the thoughts in my head onto paper. It's smooth and fluid, writes with the epitome of ease and precision, and has a nice minimalist look. I'v graduated to buying these in boxes rather than just single pens because I hate being without them and having to use "other" pens. Once you try the V5, you'll know what I mean	pos
I've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine. Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription.  	neg
These are truly good gluten-free cookies.  We have recently made the switch over to a casein-free (milk free) gluten-free diet for the sake of my son.  He is already a picky eater, so I was worried about the transition.  These cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served (ie in church school etc).  He is particularly enamored with them because they have kid-friendly animal imprints.  Being gluten free, they do tend to break more, which can be upsetting for young kids, but they taste so good, he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces. 	pos
This upgrade is worth every penny.  I agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even.

I have 3 Danelectro Fab effects pedals. The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection. A couple, more expensive effects I purchased, made by another brand, don't seem to be any better than the Danelectro Fab. ---  --- The casing is a heavy duty plastic, not metal so I'm not sure how well it would hold up to stage use or someone with a heavy foot.  ---  --- As for the comment about this pedal being a waste of time by another reviewer, most guitarists already know that they need to purchase an AC adaptor for a power source. Consider it a learning experience. Once you buy the adapter be sure to pick up a multi-plug cable if you want more than one effects pedal. This allows you to hook up several more plugs to the one AC adaptor. I now have 5 effects pedals hooked up to one energy source. Bought mine at The Guitar Center so I don't know if Amazon carries them. ---  --- Radio waves are everywhere and travel great distances depending on the tower they come from.

I liked the Santana - Steven Tyler song/video.

Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable.  She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of  really interpreting the song.

This book was someone else's bookclub selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, "stock" phrases, and "hanging" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However, I found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  I found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  I also liked Dr. Temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  Great idea! Although the book really goes all over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my "seeking/hunting" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold	pos

I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send. 	neg
I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!!

Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchová) attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.) ---     ---    But enough of my pretentious analysis, hehe. The point is, Milos Forman's LOVES OF A BLONDE, like Jiri Menzel's arguably more celebrated CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, is a film that, though short at 85 minutes, takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression, in its own light and subtle way. Its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation, it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do.

I ordered the original item, used it for about a week, then sent it to my son in New Hampshire.  He used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up, never to function properly again.

My boyfriend used to search online stores for the French cologne Jean Patou pour Homme because it was the only "upscale" cologne he would wear (It was awesome!). However, it is not produced anymore and is very hard to find and very expensive. He searched high and low to find a replacement, and this is it! ---  --- Sean John Unforgivable is surprisingly good. Masculine, but not too musky or cheap smelling. Now, this is all my boyfriend will wear - and I'm not complaining! ---  --- Guys - women will love how you smell when you wear this. Women - buy this for your boyfriends/husbands, but only let them wear it when they're on a date with you! :) ---  --- Anyway, it's worth the cost, and it's our new favorite.	pos
Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo seems to be a very good product. I noticed a difference the first time I used it -- there was no residue on my scalp, and my flakiness was greatly reduced. It produced a very rich lather, also. The only thing I didn't like about it was the possibility that I'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients, but the instructions didn't tell which ingredients might make this happen. I, myself, am sensitive to many products, and didn't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo. I would recommend this product to others	pos
This a classic John Carpender film but defentaly one that needs a sequel by him. The skill with which action mixed with heavy metal music is excellent. As far as I'm concerned everyone in this si-fi horror thriller did their job right. I could feel it ,be it , live it. It could be real. Each character brought something essential to this film. I'm not the only one that likened the  martian leader to a cross between Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie. There are very powerful fight survival scenes with just enough blood and gore to freak you out and keep you on edge. Who will get possessed next? A must see. More than once to notice all of the effects, and believe me they are powerfull. --- Watch it and see who lives and who dies and how. --- Great work Mr. Carpender	pos

This book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every American president. Each individual section includes a brief summary of the president's successes and failures while in office. The "secrets lives" aspect includes a description of his temperament, character and personal habits. For example, John Adams is said to have been vain and irritable, while Frankin Pierce is depicted as an alcoholic. Also much oddball trivia is mentioned, such as that George Washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood.  ---  --- The biographical information is at least somewhat educational, especially on the lesser known presidents such as Millard Fillmore and Zachary Taylor. But most people who study history will already known much of what is written here. The truth is that O'Brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials. But rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few  books, such as "The Reader's Companion to the American Presidency," and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining. Also O'Brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars. ---  --- However, what I found most disturbing about this book is O'Brien's tone and attitude. His so-called "humorous style" is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents, especially those he dislikes. For example, he jokingly suggests that Andrew Jackson had "some unknown frontal lobe damage". I have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president. In fact, I disagree with much of Jackson's presidential agenda, especially his bigoted policies directed against American Indians. However, I also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that O' Brien uses. Overall, I found the book to be juvenile, mean-spirited and overly negative. There are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there. So don't waste your time on this one.  	neg
Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western.

For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter. ---  --- One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease. ---  --- The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007. ---  --- On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run.	neg
This is a good solid phone so far.  Other reviewers are correct that you should invest the time to the read the manual.

The iPod Mini Case self is very good from Pacific Design. But Amazon made a mistake to choose eBags as their supplier. ---  --- I have ordered one iPod and one iPod Mini cases for my friend's daughters as a Christmas gift. The iPod case was shipped from Amazon directly, as usual, it was nice packed and fast shipping. The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags. It was bad, bad and bad. I won't order anything from eBags any more. Here is why: ---  --- - It was almost one week later than Amazon's shipment. --- - It was an open, unpacked or returned item. --- - Amazon charges the shipping for that item, even you qualify for the free shipping on your order. ---  --- If you don't care about all of these, please go ahead and good luck. I gave 2 stars is because of the product self, otherwise I would give none	neg

So, it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it.

This book is terribly organized.  I'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that Professor Jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in. ---  --- My main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does Jones bother to define them.  (I would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  The fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept. ---  --- Examples are numerous, but here are a few: --- **robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  Defined? (pg. 183) --- **sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231. --- **Louis-Sebastien Mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  When did Jones provide information (that he was a "journalist, dramatist and observer of Parisian mores") on just WHO Mercier is?  Page 215. ---  --- Aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  One such is in the text box on Saint Genevieve.  Jones mentions that she negotiated with Frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  She died in 512AD, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but I should not have to figure that out.) ---  --- The redeeming quality of the book is that if DOES offer information on Paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances.  And Paris is not such a bad subject	neg

Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to "evaluate" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the "evaluation" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc).  ---  Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!! --- Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!!	neg
I think this doll is incredibly fun and beautiful, but somehow the tail broke off the very first day my 4 year old daughter played with it.  She loves it anyway, she insists.

OMG - if you decide to use this use it SPARINGLY!!!!  I can't stress it enough.  I decided to get the Philosophy acne kit because I had a few minor breakouts and clogged pores.

I can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea.  The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary.

This toy is wonderful for several reasons. For one thing, it's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need. It has very basic shape sorting (with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in), plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks.  ---  --- The toy also helps teach colors and animals, and the locks develop fine motor skills even further. ---  --- Overall, this toy is very well made. It's real wood, dove tailed together. It could, of course, fall over, but if your child is the 18 months or older that is recommended for this toy, he or she probably isn't small enough for it to hurt. The locks on this toy are a little more chintzy. They wobble, which makes locking or unlocking some of them more difficult...But you could look at this as just another learning tool. ---  --- My biggest concern is that the blocks are relatively small; they could squeeze through a toilet paper tube. This means they are a potential choking hazard, so you'll want to supervise when your child uses this toy. ---  --- All that said, my 20 month old LOVES this toy and plays with it more than anything else she has	pos
I used to love Light & Tasty, then they decided to change the look and format, even though reader surveys said keep it the same.  The new look is hard to read, and lacks the down-home feel that makes the magazines popular.  There are less pictures of the finished dishes, and the pictures they do show are smaller.  They added full page ads for thier country store products, which goes against the no ad promise.  I have subscribed for years, but this new look is horrible.  Get it at the store to see if you like it first	neg

Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement. 	neg
Along with "From Science To God" Mr Russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening.  Although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work, it has the same hopeful message and the same readability.   ---  --- In both books Mr Russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo, even when discussing very complicated subjects.  That isn't a statement on his intelligence or research, but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels.  Neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings.

I have only read the Swedish translation of what I suppose is the "old edition", but judging by "Look inside this book", this new English-language edition incorporates much material from the old. Incidentally, the Swedish edition gives the authors name as Kallistos Ware, apparently his taken Orthodox name, while Timothy Ware is his original, given name.  ---  --- In Sweden, the Swedish translation of "The Orthodox Church" is the only readily available book on the history of the Orthodox Church. Apparently, its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on Church history. It also contains chapters on theology and worship. ---  --- In my opinion, the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in Orthodox Church history. Its first chapters summarize the history of this Church during the Byzantine Empire, under Islam, and in Russia both before and during Communism. Of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the Catholic-Orthodox split, usually dated to 1054. The author believes that the so-called Fourth Crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split.  ---  --- However, the book must also be read with some reservations. The author is, after all, an Orthodox Christian himself. Its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there. For instance, Ware denies that the Byzantine Church was caesaropapist, a very untenable suggestion. At other times, he is surprisingly "liberal" for an Orthodox. For instance, he paints Mehmet Fatih, the Muslim conqueror of Constantinople, as a very tolerant ruler. I also wonder about his interpretation of the Church father Cyprian.  ---  --- Even so, "The Orthodox Church" remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable Christian Church.  --- 	pos

This product might be better on oily skin with no make-up. The point of it was lost on me. It may create a barrier between treatment products/moisturizer and make-up but it did nothing to perfect my skin. In fact when I touched my face I could feel make-up pilling and rolling off. It has a dry, heavy feeling to it. Don't use too much and be careful about dry patches. I thought it would make a better canvas of my skin. I now use Laura Mercier's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow. I didn't like the formulation of Philosophy's product at all	neg
We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter, who just love to make noise with anything. She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she's teething.

Okay, I have owned the Mio for 9 months now and I agree with all of the above complaints, it is not accurate, it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time, it's big and clunky looking, etc, etc. --- My biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game.  The heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless.  I returned it to Mio (with my $10.00 check) and 2 months later, i still have not got my watch back.  I complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory.  They assured me that finally after I threw a fit, it would be shipped last week.  still no watch.  The watch not only sucks, but the company sucks as well.  save your money and buy an ironman.	neg

This two parter commemorates the  10th anniversary of the Arthur show on PBS. It's nice, they could have gone cheesy and just recycled old footage but they decied to be subtle about it. Really the only thing that specifically makes this a 10th anniversary show is the fact that there are '10's hidden throughout each episodes kind of like how Marc Brown hides the names of friends and family in his picture books. It's nice to see them both together too (episodes 1 & 2), I think they aired them seperately on TV	pos
First of all, I am a fan of Madonna's music (not all of it, but a lot of it) as well as a huge ABBA fan.   --- Now I realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists... and apparently it is here as well, but why can't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic?   --- Gimme Gimme Gimme (the ABBA song that is sampled here) is a fairly simple song to begin with (as many ABBA songs are) but the complicated arrangements (both vocally and instrumentally) are what made ABBA's songs interesting and fun to listen to.   --- But taking a few bars of the original song, repeating it over and over and over, adding a dance beat, various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece.   --- I think she would've been better off either following a similar chord progression to Gimme Gimme Gimme or just doing a cover...  --- Perhaps Benny and Bjrn should've stuck to their strict "no sampling" rule here!   --- For some reason many of today's dance/pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance... A good example of a radio-friendly dance/pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is Acoustic Alchemy's "So Kylie" on their American/English album (the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what's going on, you'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression).   --- Now I'm not going to say "Hung Up" is a terrible song, because everyone has their own taste.  But I'm sorry to say it just doesn't do anything for me..	neg
What an amazing concert. Paul Simon and a 17-piece backup band supported by a 10-piece Brazilian percussion unit for all of the "Rhythm of the Saints" stuff. This is from 1991, so the content is primarily derived from "Rhythm of the Saints" and "Graceland" plus a smattering of the greatest of his earlier songs, and it's live and energetic and beautiful and for crying out loud there's seriously something like 750,000 people there. A crowd that big is usually reserved for, you know, the Pope or somebody. It's a stirring spectacle. --- Fortunately, except for the occasional wide shot, the footage focuses mostly on the band, rather than on the most exuberant of Simon enthusiasts mugging for the cameras. Simon himself is not exactly Mick Jagger as far as stage presence goes, but his voice carries charisma in ways that wild stage theatrics couldn't, and the rest of the band is hopping anyway so it doesn't matter. Simon's weakness is his occasional tendency to drift towards lite, keyboard-based adult rock and that happens here a bit, but not nearly often enough to really complain about. The emotional climaxes of this show are a massive percussive jam session at the end of "Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes" and stripped-down, powerfully moving renditions of "America" and "The Boxer," which draw wild cheers from the Central Park crowd at every passing reference to New York. While there is also a CD of this concert available (a very good one, I should add), audio alone cannot capture the raw excitement of the accordion opening to "The Boy in the Bubble." This is a concert for the ages	pos
 I thought that this would be an ideal product for my aging father as both his sight and his dexterity are somewhat impaired. My first thought was to contact the parent company, Hy-Tek Manufacturing, to ask for a dealer referral and to get some answers to a few simple operations questions. After 3 days they did get back to me, recommending Amazon as a purchase source but ignoring my request for operations information. I sent a second email but it was completely ignored. Maybe this should have been a warning. ---  ---  I decided to go ahead and order one anyway. The purchasing process was quick and easy and delivery form Amazon's agent was about 5 days, more than acceptable. The unit comes well packaged with easy to follow instructions. Actual programming is simple and very straight forward. The problems started after successfully programming my dad's satellite receiver. The main menu could not be accessed, the information button was non-functional and two of the numeric keys did not work. I tried all of the codes listed for the manufacturer of that receiver, none of them made any difference. ---  ---  Another email to Hy-Tek, and another 3 day wait, produced the response " it doesn't work with all devices and I guess it just won't work with your receiver, you'll have to send it back to the supplier. We will make note of this and maybe we can add this receiver in a future update. " No help at all and no concern or consideration expressed on the part of the manufacturer. If they had bothered to respond to my original inquiry in the first place, I would never have purchased this substandard piece of equipment and wouldn't have been out the freight charges. One of the questions that I asked originally was " will it access the main menu? ", but they didn't have the common courtesy to respond. ---  ---  Be aware that this remote will not work with all devices. Even simple, necessary functions like menu and numbers may not be accessible. The manufacturer is slow to respond to customer inquiries and less than helpful if and when they do. Would I recommend or purchase this item again, absolutely not	neg

My DJ side: --- I actually had to stop the music, open the tray on the CD player then check whether I had the right CD1 down-tempo in, or some other CD that my wife played before as the music was so not what I was expecting, sounding more like Deep Forest than JVM. To my surprise, it was Jimmy's Balance 10. I decided to Keep an open mind and listen to it anyway. I went to sleep after the 4th track. The next day I decided to listen to the second CD (mid tempo). Again I stopped the music, opened the tray on the CD player then checked whether I had the (mid tempo CD) in instead of the down-tempo I was playing the night before. Sure enough, the (mid tempo) was what I had in the player, but did not sound much different than the lullabies I was listening to on CD1. When the mid-tempo was over, I thought to myself "well, this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends". The next day I had high hopes for the up tempo CD, cause well, as the name implies, it should be where the beats and treats are. But No. Not really.  ---  --- The only reason I didn't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd CD of Jimmy Van M's Balance release is because for three days I kept telling myself that there is an up tempo CD. I didn't mind CD1&2 out of place pop tracks, I didn't mind the different types of music being played in sequence, or rather, out of sequence. I didn't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel I stayed in two years ago in Vienna. All this will be forgivable when I hear the up-tempo, because I was so sure it's going to be awesome. Unfortunately, I was not quite right about my assumptions. Things did not start happening until track 5 (The Reducer 2), I don't really need some 4 tracks on the third CD to get me warmed up. Jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that, in his down + mid-tempo crap. For the most part, this production of the Balance series - especially the first 41 tracks in sequence - churned out some of the most lethargic, way too slow and boring music that could be described, at best, as lullabies for grown ups. As for the last 9 tracks of the up-tempo, it is actually - dare I say - decent enough, but way too late, and even worse, ended prematurely. It should have been re-arranged with tracks in reverse order on every CD to be as follows: (CD3) up-tempo should have been (CD1) renamed (in the car from club to home), (CD2) mid-tempo should have been renamed (at home in the living room) and finally (CD1) down-tempo should have been (CD3) renamed (in your bedroom).  This just makes more sense.  The reason I say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us (9) to the rest of the sleepy, mellow ones (41). For example, chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually. I have never come across a chill CD that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones, that's not chill. JVM Balance did exactly that; took forever to ascend to a certain point, then crashed almost immediately. What gives?   ---  --- Half star for CD1 --- Half star for CD2 --- 3 stars for CD3 ---  --- My human side: --- Dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there, Duh! --- Jimmy made that very clear in this release. If you want to listen to a wide range of (not bad!) music, then Balance 10 is for you. Dive in JVM selection of what he thinks makes us human; expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive. As a matter of fact, we don't even need music (or any type of arts for that matter) to survive at all. Still we listen to it, we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it. Music can represent our feelings, desires and wishes, and with JVM Deep Forest like music here (as I mentioned before) I can't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority. I think it shows.	neg
On a scale of 1 to 5, the packaging gets a negative 1. You can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle, ended up removing top. ---  --- For value of product, Jonathan gets a 1. ---  --- For quality of product 3. ---  --- The conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. Need to use more than average. The conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair, but no better than other quality brands. I do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time, but Bed Head has a similar product that's been out for a while. For that option I would rather choose Bed Head for quality and price	neg

The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present	pos
This is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners against. ---  --- The first red flag is the ridiculously high maximum magnification of over 700x. Do you know what you will see at 700x in this scope? Nothing but a dim blur. Note that the objective (main) lens is 60mm. All telescope optics have inherent limitations; maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x. Therefore, with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120-140x,  increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown, and that's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good.  ---  --- The finder is useless, smaller than the bare minimum size of 6x30.  Finding anything but the moon will be time-consuming and frustrating.  The low power 20mm eyepiece may or may not be usable on the scope, depending on its design and field of view.  That the design information is not given in the ad is disturbing.  And don't even think of using the 4mm (high power) eyepiece or the barlow.   ---  --- I do not recommend equatorial mounts for beginners.  Their tracking properties are primarily for astrophotography, and for this they require careful setup.  The equatorial mount on this scope is provided primarily as a marketing gimmick to impress naïve buyers with its complex "scientific" appearance.   ---  --- In a way, it is hard to fault Celestron for making and marketing this scope.  Their upper-tier instruments are quite good, but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this.  In one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models.  Just make sure, gentle reader, to stay away from the toys. ---  --- Using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an MP3 file and but rather like playing a guitar. It is a learned skill. And you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope. Buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving. If you want to see the wonders of the sky, contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties. The members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started. The best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars (decent ones are available on Amazon), then graduate to something along the lines of a 150-200mm (6-8") Dobsonian; Celestron's own 6" Starhopper can be found on Amazon for under $290. ---  --- For more information on buying telescopes, see my encyclopedic guide on Amazon: "So you want to buy a telescope.	neg

The author makes a couple of valuable points. First, any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent "secular" (i.e., indefinitely long) bear markets. Most leading investment advisors recommend a "buy and hold" strategy, but this only works during predominately bull market periods. Most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market, which is anomalous in historical terms. The author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that "buy and hold" doesn't always provide the best returns. Obviously, then, it's better to pull out during the bear markets, but that's easier said than done. The author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets, including P/E ratio, interest and inflation rates, and GDP. The problem is that those characteristics don't always correlate with market performance. For example, this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market. Well, if you heeded his advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005 and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. Even with high P/E ratios, a bull market can continue for several years: witness the late 90s. It's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. There is so much volatility on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched directions. By the time that it is apparent, it's too late to profit. Even in the midst of great bull markets, there might be week, month, or even year-long downturns. The author says nothing about individual stock picking, beyond a general value approach. The book is all about big picture, long term trends. Another problem is that the author's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. But the market (and economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. As they say, past performance does not predict future returns.  ---  --- The investment advice provided here is not useful. He suggests a "portfolio of hedge funds," ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500K. He also recommends a "bond ladder," an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund, and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations. I don't need to spend $25 and five hours reading to learn that! ---  --- One thing I did learn from this book is the impact of volatility, which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations. Volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for. Most studies just average the returns across years, but that doesn't reflect real returns. Let's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35% the first year and -15% the second. Your average return should be 10% a year, right? Wrong. At the end of the first year you have 135k. Minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total, equal to 7% a year compounded. If you had received 10% a year compounded, your final total would be over 121k. That's 6k difference in just 2 years, and the volatility costs add up. ---  --- The book is very poorly written, plodding, sooooo boring, with tons of repetition. Just as an example, the graph showing the "Y curve" relationship between P/E ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times.	neg

After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about using the product I had already ordered.

It feels clean and sleek. The conditioner smells like pina coloda, yum!  I would definatly recommend this for my hair type.  Would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min.  Hope that helps	pos

In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.   ---  --- What I like about it most: --- - It looks and feels solid.  Some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars.  It's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a Hummer over, but it certainly seems to outdo DSLRs in it's category.   --- - Very good battery life. --- - Backwards compatibility with decade's worth of Nikon SLR lenses. ---  --- My gripes: --- - The latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week. --- - Inability to meter through older manual focus lenses. --- - Lack of full functionality with flashes other than the SB-600 and SB-800.   --- - Nikon's RAW software and control software aren't included with the camera, and are IMHO overpriced.  (...and on top of that, Nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages...) ---  --- What would improve this camera the most: --- - ISO 100 and ISO 3200+  --- - Ability to store multiple custom white balance presets, and then pull them up on the fly. --- - Replacing the "idiot modes" (i.e. "portrait", "landscape", etc.) with modes that you could customize	pos
This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word "wrap", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier: --- 1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion. --- 2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top. --- I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them. --- On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of.	neg
My two boys, ages 3 and 2, both pull this book off the shelf over and over.

This is by far the most expensive relaxer I've ever used and it is worth every penny.  I first heard of it as being Oprah's relaxer so I decided to hunt it down.

My hair stayed soft AND STRAIGHT no matter what the weather or I did to it. And it's the healthiest it's ever been.  No other relaxer ever did that for my hair.  In fact they usually made it worse! I absolutely love the Phytorelaxer and I am officially addicted.  If it were less pricey, it would get 5 stars	pos

My first viewing of this film was a great disappointment.  I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy.  And I emphatically did not like the film.  Then I viewed the film a second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light, and absolutely loving this film.  This DVD is an absolute gem, and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life, as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming (because he's talked to those who were).  Kreuger's commentary alone is worth the price of this DVD.  After seeing this film for the first time, you must go back and see it again through Miles Kreuger's eyes.	pos
This original version is much funnier than U.S. version. The humor is dry and intelligent, and the characters are very complex: at times, you feel sorry for them; other times, you love them and laugh with them; and mostly, you think they're idiots. What a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience.  ---  --- It's not often I can watch a DVD or series over and over, but this is one that I've enjoyed each time	pos

R-Type Final (2004.) ---  --- INTRODUCTION: --- Over the years, Irem's R-Type series has been one of the finest side-scrolling space shooter series out there. From its dawn in the eighties to the modern age, the series has always pleased its fans, serving up its share of uniqueness and challenges alike. Many installments of the series have graced a number of gaming consoles and arcades alike. In 2004, the series finally hit the big consoles of the era. The Playstation Two was the only gaming system that was fortunate enough to receive R-Type Final. How did this new, modernized version of the series fare? Read on and find out! ---  --- OVERVIEW: --- R-Type Final was released for the Playstation Two gaming console in early 2004. The game features a number of different gameplay modes, configurations, vehicles, and other variables to keep things interesting. The game is a product of the Irem Corporation. ---  --- REVIEW: --- I have always loved the R-Type series, and I was ecstatic to hear that the series was finally getting the next generation console treatment. And after finally giving the game a whirl, I must say, for the most part I am impressed. The game stays true to its roots, while at the same time incorporating just enough new elements to make the experience fresh. Let's see where this game succeeds, and where it falls flat. ---  --- -THE GOOD: --- -CLASSIC-STYLE R-TYPE GAMEPLAY. If you've played any other game in this series, you'll pick this one up right away. The game plays similar in style to its predecessors, and as such, is very easy to learn if you've played any other game the series has to offer.  --- -LOTS OF NEW ELEMENTS THROWN INTO THE EXPERIENCE. When you start the game, you'll have your choice of three ships, but you can unlock more - there are over a hundred ships total! The game also features plenty of new weaponry and power-up items. If you play the game heavily, it's going to reward you well. --- -CHALLENGING! If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right place! This game serves up its fair share of challenging elements, and it never lets up. Even game masters will be challenged! --- -CONTROLS ARE EASY TO LEARN, AND EFFECTIVE. If you played any installment of the series on the Super Nintendo, you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this control scheme.  ---  --- -THE BAD: --- -DESPITE ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS, IT'S STILL THE SAME GAME. Even though I like all the improvements this game has made to the series, at heart it's still the same game we played in arcades and on lesser consoles years ago. If you didn't like the series then, this new installment isn't going to change your mind. --- -NO IMMEDIATE REGENERATION WHEN KILLED. This has always been a huge flaw of this series, and I am disappointed to see that this wasn't fixed. In most space shooters, you regenerate immediately after you die, right where you died. Not the case with this series.  --- -GRAPHICS AREN'T THAT GREAT FOR A NEXT GENERATION GAME. Granted, the gameplay is the most important thing here, but still, I think they could have done a little better with all of the hardware available. ---  --- OVERALL: --- Despite the obvious issues, this is one of the best versions of R-Type I have played to date. If you're a big-time fan of this series, this installment is well worth checking out. If you're not a fan, though, this one isn't going to change your mind. Still, if you are one of the many R-Type fans out there, don't hesitate to give this one a whirl. ---  --- EDITION NOTES: --- This game, it seems, wasn't produced for a very lengthy period of time. As such, it seems to be rather difficult to come by. You're probably going to have to order it online, or check around in used game stores. This one is tough to come by new.	pos
I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing.  In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints.  It was difficult to install--buggy.  It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up.  The "objects" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot.  Hardly intuitive at all.  Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up.  I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else.  For $10 it would be a good purchase.  For anything over that, you are wasting your money.  Try another product, a demo first, or something.  But in my opinion this was a big waste of money	neg
Switched from Panda Anti-Virus to this one.  Great software, very sensitive settings.  It was quite aggrevating at first getting constantly interrupted in other programs to be told of various things going on.  Finally got each feature individually adjusted to settings I can live with, and it works great.  They could improve the filtration time (long) to analyze your computer (I only have a 40gig HD with about 20gig used) as it takes about 20-25 mins. to do the complete cleansing process.  However, first time I ran it after having run Panda for the last time, it caught 2 undetected trojans Panda missed.  It also isolated a hidden file trying to access the internet for "updates" that I still have not been able to identify, but it's zapped.  Overall, best I've seen so far, and you can install it on up to 3 computers from one cd (just name each installation with a different username to accomplish, all perfectly legal with the 3 User CD deal).  I have 3 laptops covered at a cost of about $13 each - I'll take that all day long	pos
i love this pendant, every time i wear it  people want to know where i got it, back in the 70's we bought items that reminded us of the eagles and lynn skynn's Free Bird. so when i wear it it reminds me of the good old days. yeah i know it's a pheonix, but whn i bought it was called an eagle.(ebay	pos
Sometimes the National Enquirer is the only place to find the true story about a subject - for example it broke the story about O. J.'s shoes. I guess you have to pick and choose your articles.

I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on your bf/gf/husband/wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song! Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are SUPERB: ---  --- 1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over and over and with so many different versions. Although I can still listen to it over and over --- 2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad. Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) ) --- 3. Get Down Like that 10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song for you) --- 4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just feels like.... Magic.) ---  --- This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R&B albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R&B album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had poorly done upbeat song	pos
i dont agree with the previous reviewer at all. my kids love everything in this book and if i find enough time i want to make every single toy. they are not scary looking at all. if you like knitted babes by claire garland, you ll love this one.  ---  --- there are 5 themes in this book:  --- enchanted land: Princess and castle  --- fairy dream: fairy and baby, flower pillow, unicorn --- wild trail: cowboy and mustang --- set to sea: pirate and ratty, dinghy --- magical waterworld: Mermaid, fish, seahorse and crab, dolphin ---  --- there are also pages on knitting, crochet and stitching basics.  --- this is probably not a book for a beginner, but if have some experience you ll want to get your needles, hooks and yarn and just get going.  --- i can only recommend this one. 5 stars!!!	pos
When I was buying my husbands Olympus Camera this Rechargeable battery popped up as a suggested purchase to go with camera so I ordered it.  Not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it I assumed it was compatable with the camera I was purchasing at that time.  No it was not!!!  So I paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable.  Now I have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION OF A RETURN!!!! ---  --- NOT A HAPPY AMAZON SHOPPER!	neg

I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list. ---  --- 50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone.  ---  --- Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought if on the new computers we have ordered.	neg

I bought this game two weekends ago and have had both fun and frustration with it.  I'm a Freecell junkie and have gone so far as to download a better version (more games) than the one that came with my computer.  I lost track of how many total games I've played over the years since I've used several computers, but I play about 10 games a day on average.  I'm very competitive and love keeping track of my stats.  Unfortunately, that is the weakness of this version of the game.  For example, if you get into a position were you can move only one card back and forth between two columns and there are no other moves, all you can do is hit the replay button or move on to another game.  If you hit the replay button you don't get a loss recorded, which of course you should.  Consequently, it is easy to run up a high win percentage with this version of the game just by resigning a game when you think you are going to loose and replay it.  Then when you finally win, you get credit for a win.  Of course, that is not proper scoring either.  Also, there is a key combination that when you do lose a game outright and want to replay, you don't get any further losses counted against you.  That's as it should be.  The only problem is that key combination is very flaky and doesn't always work.  Other than scoring inconsistencies, it's a great game!  It's very easy to use.  Although different to use than playing with a mouse on your computer, if you've played a lot on your computer you'll pick up the operation of this version almost immediately.  The display is large and easy to see, and there is a low light level sensor on the front that will automatically light the screen when you are playing in an area with poor lighting.  That is a great feature.  I love playing this game while sitting in the airport waiting to board a plane and on the plane itself while in the air.  It's a great and challenging way to pass the time away if you like playing solitaire.  On the next version of this game, I hope they will beef up the statistics capabilities of the unit	pos

I had a pretty dirty car and I used the Mr. Clean Starter Kit. I followed all the directions.I also washed my car in the shade, and I rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. I waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. It still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing I did during the soaping step. It even took more water than what I would have used washing it the old fashion way. I looked that the FAQ sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. It's just a hassle. At least I can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. Otherwise it's a waste of money	neg

We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.	pos
I had read--with delight--the book called "Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH" to my grandsons, so I thought the movie would be a nice followup. ---  --- Wrong! It barely resembles the book, and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out. It might be OK for a child who hasn't read the book, but we were disappointed	neg

Certainly there are more expensive teas, but I've yet to have a better cup than Twinings Earl Grey, which is a perfect blend of comfort and spice.  It works brilliantly as a "Good morning, how do you do," or a "Rest well, sweet dreams" sort of a beverage.   ---  --- Many other Earl Greys on the market struggle with the proper blending of the bergamot oil, which can be quite overwhelming if overdone; but, it is what makes Earl Grey unique, so one does want to be able to taste it.  Too many other tea companies cannot seem to grasp this delicate balance, but Twinings has always gotten it just right.   ---  --- The tea can be enjoyed au naturel or with a slight dash of cream...not too much, because you don't want to drown out the enjoyable, lively flavor of the bergamot.   ---  --- For me, when it comes to a cup of hot tea, this is simply the best.	pos
I just bought this waterproof case in order to use my Canon s410 on a scuba diving trip.  I was a little nervous at first (I could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone!), but I have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably!  I used it on 6 dives, and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet.  I did not have one leak!  A word of caution--I followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel (just a small amount).  I would like to think that the camera would not leak without this, but I did not want to take any chances. ---  --- I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their Canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach	pos
Having an M.A. in English literature as well as a B.A. in literature and history, anytime a movie is BOTH historical AND literary . . . well, I get a bit excited to say the least. I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it's not, but the writers/directors/producers set it against a "historical" backdrop nonetheless. On that note, this is yet another stellar title from noneother than Ridley Scott. With that being said, I enjoyed "Tristan and Isolde" almost as much as "Gladiator" and a bit more than "Kingdom of Heaven" (all of these, by the way, are Ridley Scott films). Notice the historical adaptations here?  ---  --- While it may be true that the story of Tristan and Isolde was inspirational to Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the Arthurian legend, this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types. No sir, good ol' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie. This is by no means a "chick flick" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense. On the other hand, it's not the typical "hack and slash" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story. In short, it should please both sexes simultaneously.  ---  --- Aside from James Franco (Tristan), I was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast. Sophia Myles (Isolde) is, for the most part, a newcomer to American audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly British films. I suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the Atlantic. While many of the other characters were convincing in their roles, no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant Irish king (who just so happens to be Isolde's father).  ---  --- In short, this is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. On some levels it reminds me of "King Arthur." Just as "King Arthur" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot, so too does Ridley Scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the Angle and Saxon kingdoms in England. If you'll recall in "King Arthur," Arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading Saxons just as the Roman legions were exiting Britannia. Historians will point out that there is no evidence of Saxons in England until several decades AFTER the Roman withdrawal, but oh well . . . it made for a good story. Here, we witness the Celtic Britons as they are exploited by the Irish across sea. WHAT???? The Irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around? Well, "Tristan and Isolde" holds true to history in this aspect; namely, that the Celtic Britons of England were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. This would, of course, have placed them in what is now Wales and Cornwall. And this is exactly where the movie is set. Let's not forget the story of Saint Patrick. Remember, he was actually a Romanized Briton who was captured and served as a slave in Ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to Ireland to convert the populace to Christianity. It's interesting to note that in the movie Christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in Ireland, so no doubt Ridley Scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand.  ---  --- I particulary liked "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of Heaven" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics. Critically speaking, "Tristan and Isolde" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well---but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics?  ---  --- Rent it first if you must, but I suspect this one will be a "keeper" in your DVD library! 	pos
This battery is backwards compatible with the D50, D70/70s, and is used in the D80 and D200.  So if you have any Nikon DSLR and want a second battery, you want to get this one so that when you upgrade your camera you can use the battery. ---  --- This battery has built-in circuitry that tells you the actual charge status of the battery, and it is accurate.  This is a big deal; *if you are using the D200 or D80* it lets you know when your really do need to switch batteries or charge up.  This is the first battery I've seen that is accurate in this regard.  Kudos to Nikon. (This feature does not work in the D50/70/70s but the battery otherwise works fine)	pos
I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.

I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe. We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100% peace of mind knowing that he won't be able to escape and injure himself. It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.	pos
I purchased subscription on December 23, 2006. Trusted Amazon to deliver a good service. The estimate for delivery was 4-6 weeks.

driller killer has, without question, the best director's commentary of any dvd i have ever seen. although driller killer is a far cry from his second film "ms. 45" it is a classic. reno can't seem to buy a thrill. despite the fact that he lives with two bombshells he can't get his painting finished to collect for the rent. his agent's reaction to his finished painting is absolutely priceless. what's worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk band to move in upstairs, adding insult to injury. the band, tony coca cola and the roosters, play "the grand street stomp" a guitar riff that has a great driving force. this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of the 1970's. conventions are borrowed from polanski's "repulsion" and cassaveetes' "shadows". the handheld mingling with the street people of the period shows how filthy NYC was at the time. Lots of fun. Driller Killer was meant to be listened to loud	pos

Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the "class divide". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail?  ---  --- The problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves. There's very little "energy" at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic. Molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural Kentucky. When her stepfather begins fondling her, and her mother does little to help, Molly tries for the only escape she can find - marrying the older bad-man-in-town, Viggo Mortensen. She claims she never slept with Viggo - only used him for escape. Then Viggo's father began fondling her, and now she wants out of this house as well.  ---  --- To get momentary relief from her homelife, she hangs out at a friend's home, which is a 24 hour party. Here she runs into Andrew. Andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high-class, wealthy girlfriend. The girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns, having children and living the perfect life. Andrew goes with the flow until he sees Molly - and is instantly in lust. Molly leads him to believe she's 20, single, and interested in him. It takes maybe 3 days before he's sleeping with her. To his credit, he does tell his fiancee promptly, and breaks off the engagement.  ---  --- You'd think everything was wonderful now, right? However, Andrew learns from friends about Molly's lies. He decides to keep seeing her anyway. However, he doesn't want to introduce her to his family, and has no intention of marrying her. He says he loves her - but his feelings seem to be more related to sex. At one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off.  ---  --- There's a telling scene near the end when Andrew thinks Molly has been publicly stripped by her husband. Andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with Viggo. Andrew is deliberately rude - laughing at Viggo's artwork and putting him down. But it's Viggo who is the calm one here. When Molly shows up, Viggo points out that Molly's been doing all this lying and scheming so that Andrew would be a Knight in Shining Armor and ride off with her. He asks Andrew - if you're saying I'm not good enough for her - it seems that you think you're too good for her, right? Andrew finds himself agreeing - that he won't take on Molly himself. He wants to get Molly away from Viggo, but then is going to abandon her to her own means. How could he figure that Molly would be better off with nobody at all, vs with Viggo?  ---  --- Fast forward to a year later, and Molly has in fact found herself a "wealthy college boy" to take care of her and is taking classes again. She's happy, and Andrew is sad. I suppose you have to give them credit for a not-typical Hollywood ending to the story.  ---  --- The landscapes are often gorgeous, and the various details of high class, low class, city, country are all played nicely against each other. So the problem really comes down to the main actors. Molly and Andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth. You really get a sense of shallowness when you're watching this movie. Andrew has an entire life including a long-term romance, that he's set in. In just 3 days he's thrown it all away for Molly - but you never get any real sense that he cares about her. Molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life - including seducing and lying to Andrew in order to convince him to rescue her - but she never seems to care much either.  ---  --- Intriguingly, only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie. One is Ben Stiller, Andrew's best friend. It's ironic because Ben's character IS shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him. Even so, Ben really seems authentic as someone who isn't used to having to worry about others - but who really does try his best, many times, to get Andrew to wake up to reality. The other is Viggo Mortensen. You only glimpse Viggo once until the end of the movie - he's just referred to as a "rough guy" who has done many bad things. When you actually encounter Viggo (after Andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him) you're prepared for the worst. However, Viggo is very patient, very well spoken, and quite intelligent in his commentary. He doesn't thrash Andrew for sleeping with his wife. Instead, he lays out the situation and makes both Andrew and Molly face their failings. Molly deliberately lied and used Andrew as a tool of getting a better life. Andrew, for his part, knew he'd never actually rescue Molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her.  ---  --- Some have said this is the worst movie ever. Many sections of it can be very painful to watch. However, I do find glimmers of meaning - especially in the ending discussion with Viggo. Even there, though, you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for Andrew and Molly. Instead, both seem to think, "Yeah, I guess that's true. Oh well, see ya." I don't mind gloomy movies at all - in fact I really appreciate them sometimes. However, if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting, it just makes the whole experience fall flat.	neg
I've used this Actron CP9175 AutoScanner Diagnostic Code Scanner with Freeze Frame Data for OBDII (Post-1996) Vehicles, on a 2001 Lincoln towncar and a 1999 BMW Z3. In both cases, the device performed flawlessly, and I'm very pleased with the ease of use	pos
Man, when it's the end of the month and there is no food in the fridge, I like to cook up a hot pot of Ramen Noodles. I just boil those noodles and hook it up with canned pork, tuna, cheese, green beans, tomatoes, lima beans, or pig feet. The best way to eat Ramen noodles is to pour a lot of hot sauce on top of it. Mm! Mm! Good! A hot bowl of Ramen noodles on a cold rainy day at the end of the month makes me feel good inside. It feels you right up. My favorite flavors are Beef, Roasted Chicken, and Scrimp	pos

I have been following the Laughing Man fansubs, so I've covered all this material before. I'm acquiring the DVDs as they come out to have legit copies. ---  --- The desc says 2 collectibles toys, it's actually 3. There is Batou on the plate like Motoko from Vol 3. In fact, the base plates fit together, which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that will fit together to complete a composite set. The other two toys are the Chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit from the organ-farming business (with the fake southern accent). These are easier to put together, I had problems with the Tachikoma from the last set, it broke when I tried to put the legs on. Haven't gotten around to the super-glue session yet. ---  --- The product itself: Stand Alone Complex - 2nd Gig continues some of the best animation and smartest television ever produced. Buy it, share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating it	pos
Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.  ---  --- I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.	pos

I have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years. The igniter was actually still quite good. It is very well made as are most Weber products.

My 6 year old son wanted this SO badly from Santa.  Well, he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of Dec.  What was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring, furry annoyance rather quickly. It is cute but there are several things that I (and my son) found wrong with the product. When he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes don't close all the way...kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real! Then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a HORRIBLE grinding noise!  My son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken. I explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub.  What else are you going to tell a child on Christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer?! --- Cute toy in theory, not so much in person though. I would not recommend this toy	neg
I had seen this film a number of times either on T.V. or by me popping it in on my DVD player. Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury are a pleasure to watch in this engaging story about a love affair between a  Africa American male and an Indian woman, whom both has never been to there native land, and how their romance causes strife in a small Southern town.  The movie handles the reactions by both families to the interracial union of Mina and Demetrius. Against all this, a subplot in the story revolves around the loss of a homeland and friendship between Choudhury's proud Ugandan national father and the Black Ugandan friend he left behind during Idi Amin's reign of terror.  --- There are very few movies that can capture the emotions that go along with such a sensitive and controversial matter. Most importantly the opinions, thoughts, and traditions, both negative and positive, of both the Indian and Black communities are fairly communicated through the movie. A must see film and the only one I'm aware of that explores the relationship between African Americans and ethnic Indians.	pos
I don't write many reviews, but this movie was just so pitifully lame that I felt it was my public duty to warn you about it. The fact that Amazon tries to bundle it with "House of 1,000 Corpses" must be some kind of joke! The dialogue and acting don't even rise to the standards of a made-for-TV movie. The cops don't look, talk, or act like cops, and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality (his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation).  ---  --- Also, though they try to sell this as a horror film, it isn't. This film doesn't even try to be scary. The first half is a boring, brainless detective story with robotic detectives tracking down a pretentious Buffalo Bill-esque sociopath (Dee Snider). In the second half, our psycho gets released from prison, apparently reformed, but after the townspeople try to lynch him he goes bad again and has to be put down for good. ---  --- What really makes this a waste of time is that our psycho isn't even a killer. He captures his victims and tortures them for a while. And the torture is nothing terribly gruesome, either. His idea of torture apparently doesn't go much further than sewing his victims' mouths shut and giving them unwanted piercings. Then the cops find them and haul them off to the hospital. The only victim he actually kills dies accidentally. This dung heap of a movie is just not scary, and not worth your time	neg
I'm sure there are those who'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is "much better" than another, but for my Canon EF-S 10-22mm on a 20D, I figure Canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they're willing to have branded "Canon." It fits fine, doesn't interfere with the lens hood, looks clear, seems to attenuate that nasty ultra-violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all, protects the front element. What more would one want	pos

As we all know by now, Lil' Jon is not known for his lyrical capabilities, but for his platinum productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his songs.  He is truly the king of crunk.  Many of the songs on the album are much like the hit single, "Get Low" feat. The Ying Yang Twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats, lots of swearing and yelling constantly Yeeah!, Whuut?, and Okaay!  Buying the edited version (if there is one) would be a total waste.  This album is not for the meek or faint hearted!  Much of the songs hardly have many words from Lil Jon himself, mostly from the featured artists.  These include Petey Pablo, 8Ball and MJG, Chyna Whyte, Pastor Troy, Jadakiss, Styles P., ect. --- My faveorites --- 1) Throw it up w/ Pastor Troy- a 'hood representing song with a thumping beat --- 2) Get Low --- 3) Rep Yo City w/ Petey Pablo, Bun B- a very good song with talents all around --- 4) Knockin' Heads Off- again Jon struts his stuff --- 5) I Don't Give A...- perfect for before game pumping musi	pos
We bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale, after longing for the full-priced versions at stores.  We love these chairs, but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them, one of the chairs broke recently b/c of the cords fraying over time.   ---  --- The good news is that I easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for Lafuma replacement cords-  and for $19, I will have a like-new chair again (rather than replacing the chair for $150+).  So for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording, worry no more	pos
I don't know how Nady can supply a mic, cable and stand for $25. --- The mic isn't anything to write home about - it's no Shure SM58, but it is better than could be expected and probably worth the $20 on its own. --- And then you have an XLR Mic lead - try and find one for under $10 anywhere. And it's actually reasonable quality too. --- AND you get a mic stand - you'll spend $15 on an equivalent stand. It is a prefectly adequate mic stand. Indestinguishable from the other mic stands I've purchased at $20+. --- You can't go wrong with this package. The mic's not pro, but for a stand, cable and mic, it's amazing	pos
I kept getting tickets in the mail for going through EZ pass tool booth out here in New York city. My sticker was valid and I had money in my account.

They told the system had problems and they would fix it. Well I put a stop to it when I ordered 2 reflectors for my cars. I have not had any tickets in the mail since. I love this product. It is so simple and yet effective. Everyone should get it. The best $50 I have spent lately	pos
The suction cups stay well on the window. I like the fact that I can adjust the size, and it doesn't have all the cutesy pictures.

Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the "Dracula" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la "Dracula 2000." That alone should tell you my expectations. ---  --- But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house. ---  --- However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, it earns 1 star	neg

This is a really great CD. The Candian and American Idol winners are not usually that great, but Melissa is an exception. She just belts out her soul whenever she's at the microphone.

anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft.  in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the "best" scenes if you get my drift.  if you want to see the original film this is not it.  avoid at all costs	neg

This is by far my favorite musical, not the concert but the actual musical from the 70's. When i saw Alexis Smith the first time i fell deeply in love. Of course i was only 24 at the time.Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls..

 --- I had reviewed the first edition of B'Day and I personally called it "Business day" because Beyoncé could not offer what we could expect from her especially after the highly acclaimed Dangerously in Love. Actually, in my opinion if Ne-Yo had not inserted irreplaceable" in this project, it could have been a bust. I agree Déjà-Vu and Beautiful liar were hits but I give the credit to the casting rather than the script. Had these songs been given to India Arie, God knows what was gonna happen! How can she accept to put out such a poor album? Some said Beyoncé views releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting herself from her contractual obligations to Sony Columbia and team up with Jay-Z to form a new record label... but this cannot justify such an inconsistent and poor album. ---  --- Ne-Yo confessed that the R&B genre is suffering from serious malaise. "People just forgot what it was supposed to be, what it was supposed to feel like, the essence of what it is," he says forcefully. "It's a vibe, it's a feeling -- it's supposed to make you feel something, as opposed to, `Let me go eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh and put a beat behind it and see if people will dance to it.' Come on man. There's more to it than that..." Ring the alarm from B'Day falls in the same category. ---  --- I read a reviewer who proclaimed B'Day to be the best he's ever had and this is like saying George Bush is the best president America has ever had... Does this person know The Beatles, Stevie Wonder or Aretha Franklin? I suggest him to go back to the stores and get one of their albums and he will then be able to differentiate between music and marketing. I suggest the same reviewer to get albums called what's going on' (Marvin Gaye), Purple Rain (Prince), The Day (Babyface), or even the recent Let's get lifted (John Legend).  ---  --- It is very sad to see artists (especially hip-hop) concentrating on making hits, shooting sexy videos with the major target being going platinum and most of the time I find it better to buy the single and not the entire album since they all are full of fillers. What follows is that after a few months we completely trash their records.  ---  --- Africa is the world's second-largest and second most-populous continent with 900 million people. Maybe if the same guys had a purchasing power which exceeds Latino market, Beyoncé would be realising another edition in Swahili which is the most widely spoken language in Africa and she would be arguing she's had a great love for African culture ever since she was a child pretending she's coming back to the roots. Anyway, let's not be fooled by these music industry games, their aim is to make money and this entails ignoring the basic artistic aspects. I agree bootylicious Beyonce is the hottest lady in the music scene at the moment and none has denied her natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and give us s.th that can reach our soul.  ---  --- There are some female artists who are making good music without injecting too much cash in marketing to force sales: Corrine Bailey Rae and Heather Headley	neg

I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. --- Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? --- Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? --- I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one	neg

These earrings are on their way back to Amazon. ---  --- I also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied.  When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99.

Very lightweight, fragile, and poorly finished. Not sure what the "hardwood" actually is. It looks oak-like, but is far too lightweight for it's size. It came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time. The lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off. I only used it for kata; didn't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills. After a few months of very little use, mostly sitting on the rack, it began to develop cracks. Perhaps it wasn't dried properly when they applied the finish? Regardless, the one I received (50" model) was cheap junk. You get what you pay for... Not only not recommended, but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it. Spend a little more to get better quality	neg

Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!" 	neg
I bought this DVD recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format.  Plus, it's a Sony, and I've never had any problems with Sony before.  The recorder works intermittently.  It recorded a few hours worth of shows, then it would corrupt the disk, rendering it useles (abaout 2/3 of the time).  I thought maybe it was the media, so I bought Sony media (this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time). I sent the product to Sony for repair and "they could not duplicate the issue" so they sent it back.  The Sony repair service center is located in South Texas, where the labor is cheap and it shows.  I got my unit back, and on the 2nd disk, it failed!!  Now the door is jammed and I can't take the DVD out.  Don't buy this product.  I'm buying Samsung from now on	neg

I, too, have an MA in American History, and I was never given reason to think about each of two questions raised by this important book. Firstly and fundamentally, what was the timetable by which the British military were expected to leave the former colonies, and, second, what "property" could they take with them, especially as "property" had a very particular meaning here in the new nation?  --- Was the Revolution in large part fought to maintain slavery? That surely bears on the problematic nature of our Constitution. --- The wonderfully gifted writer and historian (would that they were always the same thing!)poses these vital questions. And we are fortunate that the near simultaneous publication of David B. Davis' Inhuman Bondage complements this fine effort. So, as one reviewer suggests, it is in some ways an overwritten period, but Schama and Davis add something new and exciting to the dialogue. My thanks	pos

Tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient "Acetaminophen". Acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain, making it a great headache reliever, or a medication that treats mild strains, sprains, toothaches, etc. It also acts to reduce fever. Acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin. One drawback of Acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation (therefore, it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction). It has few side-effects. Those with liver disease should avoid Acetaminophen, as it is hard on the liver.  ---  --- Tylenol (Acetaminophen) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of Reye's Syndrome and aspirin in children.  ---  --- Tylenol is the manufacturer's proprietary name for Acetaminophen. There is a generic form of Acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter, and this version is much cheaper than "Tylenol", and the container usually contains more tablets/pills, etc. The generic form of Acetaminophen is just as effective as Tylenol, just cheaper priced.  ---  --- Sometimes Acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action. For example, Tylenol PM has diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl), which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill. Diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine, so it work for itching and allergies too.  ---  --- Tylenol is packaged in different strengths: Extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet, Standard (325 mg per tablet), and children's dose of 80 mg. Tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version, called "extended release". Rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach, the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract.  ---  --- All in all, Acetaminophen is a great product. If you want a "name brand" of Acetaminophen, Tylenol is your brand (although it will cost more). My choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen.  ---  ---  --- Jim "Konedog" Koenig	neg
I've been reading Foreign Affairs since 1980 and have always admired the well rounded scope covering everything from Social & Cultural issues, Media/Public Opinion, International law, Human rights, Economics, Trade & Finance, Science & Technology, Intelligence, Energy, resources & environment, International organizations, and the list goes on.  ---  --- What I love most about this journal is that there is no agenda - the journalism is highly ethical and thorough. You'll also find out about great new books. I've loved and studied International Relations since 1980, and this is the one magazine that has never let me down. Its coverage is the pinnacle in print journalism.  ---  --- Deserves 10 stars!  	pos

These earrings are so exceptionally shiny and cute.  The are a nice size and look very well made. A couple of small drawbacks:  The pointy edges of the sunshine's rays are kind of sharp and also, the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back, they will slide out and you will lose them (I know this because I had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section!).  They DO provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that I could easily lose it and it's hard to handle with fingernails.  BUT don't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive.  I always get lots of compliments when I wear them	pos
The item ordered was shipped promptly and was exactly as described.  No problems whatsoever	pos
You bet, this one is. There are only a few Mac oriented magazines out there and they all wish they could be this well written. This is a large format magazine and each issue is filled with a series of how-to articles that I consider the best written, best illustrated and easiest to follow. I can slog through some fairly dull reading but this is the magazine I would give to my wife / daughter / co-worker to explain how to use iChat, hook up an iSight camera, customize iCal, get started with Safari and so on.  ---  --- They review many new software tittles and the latest hardware goodies. Since it is a magazine, the reviews are very current. Each issue comes with a CD and they are starting to include pdf copies of prior issues, great for reference	pos

Great idea to hang clothes. The hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on.

Great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer. 	pos
The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable.  After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary.  I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots.  It did a brilliant job.  How about this:  take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic.  The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue.  The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body).  You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost	pos
i just purchased this album, my first misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where eagles dare).  i just bought two more albums, walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait.  my only complain is the sound quality.  it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more real too.  metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same. 	pos
WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly. --- First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write. --- But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot. --- And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time	neg

Whilst Leo Kottke plays guitar like a man with three hands and John Fahey like a man with at least 11 or 12 fingers, Robbie Basho plays like a man with about eight thumbs. That this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by Kottke or Fahey (or Peter Lang) is puzzling to say the least. But, credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant	neg

The texture of this cleanser is waxy.  I could barely get it off my face, and I broke out badly after using it.

After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising, selected the Armband Carrier. It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for. Occassionally, you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm, but it holds the iPod firmly in place. It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. If you sweat a great deal while you exercise, I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine. Would recommend it to anyone who asks	pos
Love it.  Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel.  Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice.

Also maintains all openings for data cables etc	pos

I loved the first Xenosaga. Then, this arrived. Episode 2 isen't a bad game in terms of the story, the intro is absolutely DYNAMITE. Then you get into a battle. Now, if you like tactical stuff, this is a good game for you. But if you're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing, I say save your money. Gone is the amazingly well-done battle system in the first episode. In its place stands a completely out-of-nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 Hps). Ridiculous, but that's not all. The enemies have weak "zones" that depend of the height of the attack that you input.The zones are A,B and C, A being the highest. Triangle=C, square=B and Circle=A -SOMETIMES-. See what I mean? It's completely screwed-up and you have to become deeply --- addicted to the game to understand its full potential. And if       that wasn't enough, they changed the voice actors too. Kos-Mos's  --- voice sounds more like an operator than a robot's and Momo sounds like a brat. At least, chaos' voice has improved. I'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this. I just hope Namco comes out with a better sequel, otherwise spend your moey on something else (like Shadow Hearts, for example).    	neg

I have to confess that I went to tears watching thIS movie, and usually I don't get emotional easily. It's so touching, a PhD professor of middle age find out that she is sick. Ovarian cancer. It was a shock for her, the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react. All through the movie, she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering. There is a "brilliant" young doctor (yes, one of those who always wants to be the first and the best no matter what, with a big ego, the big shot of the class) who was her student in one of her literature classes. It made me very angry, his attitude, because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way, only thinking in the results of the research. I want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way. But once in a while you can find one of these.... weird specimen. The nurse was nice and treated her in a better way. This kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans, not matter the title or knowledge you can have. And we are here to help each other, no taking advantadge of each other. I strongly recommend this movie...just be sure to have a box of facial tissues near you. --- 	pos

I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	neg

I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.   ---  --- Don't waste you money on this one.

"Sleep with Me" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of "Top Gun."  That lasts about two minutes.

Except for Tarantino's "Top Gun" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here	neg

When I had my daughter I had no clue where to begin with breast pads so I bought several different types.  A friend gave me these at my baby shower because they were here favorite.  I wish I had never wasted money on the other pads.  I did have to change these pads more often than some of the other brands.  It was worth it because they were so much more comfortable.  I didn't have any chaffing like with most others.  Also they stayed in place ten times better than any pads with adhesive. 	pos
I can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire. This size works very well for small-medium satellite speakers. I am using this wire with a Samsung HT-Q80 HTIB.

I agree with the first reviewer,"Cindy"--I love the concept, but the proportions on this swaddler just aren't right, unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn't kick his/her legs much (my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long.).  The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy.  However, I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today, and it fits much better	neg
This case is superior. It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed).

I finally had to upgrade my old faithful 35-year-old Schumacher 6 amp charger - not because it quit working, but because it didn't have enough horsepower to handle the big 105 ampere-hour trolling motor battery in my boat. I wanted a higher capacity unit, but with the same solidly built reliability I've experienced with my old Shumacher charger. This unit was priced quite a bit less than some other brands with similar capability, so I was a little afraid Schumacher, like many companies, might have gone the "cheap" route with their products by using a lightweight case and cheap components. Not so! I was pleasantly surprised to find this is a solid, heavy, well built charger in the best Schumacher tradition. Well designed with a very stout plastic cabinet with pop-up carrying handle, informative and easy to use front panel controls, and nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget to unplug it first, plus automatic polarity protection, and a looong power cord with a handy place to store the cord. I found only a single minor negative:  If I had to change anything about this unit, I'd find a quieter fan. The fan, although it's pretty loud for it's size, is at least automatic and only runs when needed, so this is no big deal to me, since I only run it in my shop/garage. Haven't tried the "start" function, which I consider a more or less useless frill for a charger of this size, but it certainly charges all types of batteries like a champ, and the automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great. I highly recommend this great little charger	pos
I had such high expectations for this game just to have them shot down. The single player game is fine with some dumb things with the enemy AI. The muliplayer is a joke! Well first you have to get online which is basically impossiable. The Multiplayer which was the best part of 2 is totally stupid and WORTHLESS in 3. One you can play by yourself.

From the commercials, Max Payne was a third-person shooter with a twist; the twist being able to kill mobsters, junkies and mercenaries in slow motion. Truly, one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you. ---  --- Aside from the slow-mo, Max Payne is essentially a third-person shooter whereupon you take control of the title undercover cop turned anti-hero, Max Payne. The story unfolds dramatically as you delve into the game. The jist of it is Max's wife and baby were brutally murdered by junkies and he's on the hunt for revenge. The plot widens, thickens and nearly bursts as you progress through the game. One can never tell who truly is on Max's side until the moment the credits roll at the end. ---  --- The bottom line is this game is very much based on the slow motion "bullet time". Gunfights would be nearly impossible without the ability to slow them down to aim and fire with apt precision. That brings about the issue with controls. One of the cons of the game are the controls. Many times have I fallen off balconies and ledges due to the analog stick making Max move just so to the right. The heavy load times can also add to the agony, especially when after over a dozen tries one still cannot overcome the obstacles in your way. ---  --- The game is definitely run on a sliding scale. The chapters start out a cake-walk and progress to a veritable teeth-grinder. At one point, I was so fed up and enraged by the game that I had to go outside and take a walk. If, however, you can take the time out to relax, focus and be patient, you should have little problem with the game. As for guns - there are lots of them. And more ammo than you can handle. Oftentimes you'll find a gun you really like and stick with it, in the process having to leave ammo behind on the corpses of your enemies. That being said, guns don't hold as much ammo as one would want, especially given the fact there is a huge surplus of ammunition abounds. Max also chews up painkillers like chocolate chips in order to heal himself - proof that he's not a guy to be messed with! ---  --- I, personally, was very much hooked on it. The cutscenes are treated in a comic book style with dialogue and inner-soliloquies lifted from a Dashiell Hammett novel. However, simply put, one will either love or detest this game. I was reeled in by it, but am very glad I've beaten and seen the end of it. However, if you just cannot get enough Max Payne, there are two additional difficulty settings unlocked after beating it along with a third, even harder setting unlocked after those. ---  --- The game was in parts extremely easy and in other parts extremely challenging. I wouldn't recommend picking this game up unless you're ready for oftentimes graphic violence, innuendo and potty-mouthery. I also wouldn't recommend picking up this game if you're not ready to be put on the verge of ripping your hair out in frustration. It is, however, conquerable and you'll very much be pleased once you do overcome the challenges	pos

This portable TV sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design.  They don't tell you that there is NO ANTENNEA nor that the TV will not work without an antennea!  The portable DVD player is great. THE TV IS HORRIBLE.

DON'T BUY THIS FOR THE TV!  We ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in.  This one was a total waste of money	neg
My husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time, he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough.

The scooter is fine. the post office lost the package, though. I called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks, and would not send a replacement unless I was willing to pay for it in advance. I opted to purchase another one through a different company that used UPS instead of USPS (more reliable shipping). Several days later the first scooter arrived, three weeks late. the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it. So, now I have two and only needed one. I realize USPS is at fault for the shipping, but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker. The scooter was a present for a birthday.

Most people I know who have viewed this film fall into two categories. On one side there are those who hate it, while on the other are those who like it. I am of the latter group. This is not a comedy, although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh, it appears to be a comedy. However, make no mistake about it, this brilliant film is more than that. It is a biting satire of a very dark side of life. One I wouldn't wish on anyone.  ---  --- I didn't know what to make of this film when I first viewed it. And I knew it was darker than a dark-comedy. Surely the director was making another statement in this film? And maybe he was. The dysfunctional life of Vanessa (Reese Witherspoon) and the even more dysfunctional life of the  sociopathic Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) converge in one hell of a nightmare.  ---  --- This satire on the life of Vanessa as a modern day "Little Red Riding Hood" meeting Bob the "Big Bad Wolf" while on her way to grandma's house was like a punch in the face when I first saw this film. I didn't think of it as a comedy--as many do, but actually a sad commentary on one part of american society. This film hits you in the gut. Even though some parts of the film are funny: the disturbing parts are much more powerful. Highly recommended	pos
For many years I Couldn't use a electric shaver because it was always a incomplete shave, so after each Christmas when I received a new one I would try it and would go back to a manual razor, THEN came along the freeglider and yippy it did a reasonable job that I would call satisfactory, the over the years That razor went obsolete so I started to look for a new replacement. I read some of the reviews. I read "the refills are costly  ... hello... 4$ a month?, then I read doesn't do a good job, Well let me report to you all this is the best darn razor, Its like magic each time I use it(cleans itself each time" its quick, comfortable , quiet, the cleaning process is so cool and I for one love the concept of a clean razor each time I use it, this razor is 10 times better then the freeglider which I loved, what a joy shaving now is , I can even shave twice (I go to work sometimes at 3am then later that night if I'm going out I can shave again and it doesn't irritate.. what a magical razor they have designed ..  ---  --- PS. The cleaning solution is not expensive (under 12$ for 3ea, that's 4$ apiece and lasts a month). ---  --- thank you to the designer  ---  --- I highly recommend this  2 thumbs up ---  --- cons ---  --- none I can see as yet ..

Justice in the criminal justice system? What is that but empty talk in the real world? IN HELL shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system. No macho Van Damme kickboxing here, but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate. A true portrayal of life in today's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men, and corrupt power brokers who run them.    --- 	pos
Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fiancé, Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of Ethne. ---  --- For the most part, only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie; for example, the way that Harry's friend, Jack Durrance goes blind, or the fact that Harry disguised himself as a Greek, not as an Arab. The change that seems most prominent, however, is the fact that in the film, Jack Durrance knows of Harry's resignation from the beginning. This subverts the whole quest that Jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel. In addition, the entire `battle' between the warden of the House of Stone of Omdurman and Harry and Abou Fatma was created solely for action value in the film. However, despite this addition of action, the movie still seems to drag at points. ---  --- Films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel; that is why they are only based on them. However, as I've said, a lot of the changes made seem senseless. I would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels, if they have an hour or two to waste. Those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else.	neg

This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. This particular magazine is about 60% color pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait. Since this magazine is pictures of Celebrities you can also use it to keep track of their hairstyle changes	pos
I saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine.  I was strongly mistaken.  Johnny Depp is a great actor with great abilites, but this is the worst movie of his I have ever seen.  Even his "cheesy" movies were better than this.  The rated R rating is light.  I couldn't believe how pornographic it was.  Even in Quills, it wasn't as raunchy as this.  Don't waste your money or your time with this one	neg
This product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card.  This little fact isn't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual (hidden from consumer). I initially loaded 1,400 photos onto a 128MB card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed. A firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250, but I could never get the file to load into the frame. Another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music.  It would have been nice to hear a RANDOM music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on. Definitely NOT worth the price. Shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback	neg
I'm very disappointed with this shredder. I got it back in October 2006, and I have only used it about 3 or 4 times.  First of all, although the product is supposed to shred up to 5 sheets at a time - IT DOES NOT. It will get jammed, so I only shred 1 or 2 sheets at a time. Tonight I used it again, and it became completely jammed from a few sheets. I cannot get it to work again.  It is very loud and a bit slow, but I can live with that, I just don't like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times. I recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder, unlike the Royal "5-sheet" Crosscut Shredder HT500x	neg
I loved "The Incredibles," so I was excited to play the game.  I've only been playing video games the last couple years, and only off and on, so I'm really just a beginner.  Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I've had with this game.  My boyfriend is a long-time video game player, and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over.  Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much.  I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy.  I almost cried.  LOL  But seriously, unless you are a good gamer, you're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game.  As for me, I guess I'll stick to action RPGs	neg

We looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with. On the surface, the Bruder looked the part. Not as cartoon-looking as some, the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice.  ---  --- Actual play testing though shows this product isn't very well-built, at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear. This truck wasn't subjected to being thrown down the stairs, jumped on, etc. It's been just played with, but it started coming apart quickly.  ---  --- The hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design. The plastic hinges on the truck are too thin, and break easily. The plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open/closes, and the plastic weakens and breaks off.  ---  --- The hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate, and stick easily. Items put into the cab (like the essential green army man who drives the truck) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove.  ---  --- Worse though is the key point of this toy, the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting/dumping mechanism. This is way to complex for a child, and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult.  If it's not hooked up right, the can falls off when you try to lift it; very frustrating.  ---  --- Some little pieces (rear view mirror, etc) broke off easily and early on, but we kind of expected this. The parts were simply too small and fragile to last long. I don't hold this part against the design; part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck, and I don't think there's an easy way to add small details without some fragility. ---  --- While this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys, he can't really play with it the way he'd like to. While he still enjoys driving it around the house, he can't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help, and that's a shame.  ---  --- For the price, I expected so much more.	neg
I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device	neg

Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an "isupercharger" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along.	neg

Gene Watson was one of the finest voices in country music, and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice.  Considered by some to be "hard country", I find Gene Watson to have a more "pop" oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs;  and in the '70's, that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts.  While many of the songs on this album are pure country, others are the typical, drab, 70's pop that filled the void between the Nashville Sound and the New Traditional era of the 80's.  In any case, there is no doubt that Gene Watson earned his spot in Country Music, and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today;  including his signature songs "Farewell Party" and "Love in the Hot Afternoon".  If you prefer the more traditional country sound, his "You Could Know as Much About a Stranger" and "Should I Come Home" are also included	pos

All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres.  I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump.  The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy.  I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.  In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets.  I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test	neg

Like many overhead gym type toys, this one turns out to be for short or legless babies. When my daughter kicks the kickplates, she kicks the toy right away from her (and this is on carpet), and when we brace the toy against something, she kicks herself right out from under the toy. We have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys. Now that we have looked at the box more closely, the baby in the picture has his/her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy. Our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and is already too big for this. On a positive note, this is a very well made toy in all other respects. Looks durable, as are all Chicco toys, and the music and lights are pleasant. Another negative: you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights, and most babies want to pull them. Might be good for a tummy toy, but we're not waiting for that--we'll try the Chicco 3 in 1 gym instead, as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate	neg

This is a really nice compact camera from Canon. The picture quality is excellent. I have tried some night/day shots and the pictures are great. The zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for. The build quality is excellent and I really love the 3" display. I find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it. The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand. The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp. I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon. The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery. Also get a SD card with large enough memory. What comes with the camera (32MB) is really a waste. Still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card. But overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results	pos

Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia.	neg

I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'. ---  --- My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh. ---  --- Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces	neg
I just love this grill.  I previously had a regular Weber kettle charcoal grill, but when my son took it to college I had the perfect excuse to upgrade.   --- The grill is large enough to grill meat and veggies for a family of 4 to 6. The cooking grate has hinged sides. This allows you to easily add more coals every hour or so for extended indirect grilling cooking.  You won't believe how handy the very large and stable table is; it is very durable and cleans up nicely.   --- Store your large bag of charcoal in the rain protected bin, then just pull out the bag to pour charcoal right into the 2 charcoal holders. The charcoal holders keep the coals gathered together to light well and eliminate the need for a "charcoal chimney".  You only need to run the propane burner for 5 minutes to get the coals started, so one canister lasts quite long. (I always set a timer so I don't forget to turn it off.) The charcoal holders are perfect for indirect grilling, just push them to the sides of the kettle when the coals are ready. If direct grilling, you can still use the charcoal holders to heat the coals, then use tongs to dump the coals onto the bottom grate when they are ready. Very convenient.  The bottom wire shelf makes a perfect spot to set the hot charcoal holders after you dump the coals into the grill. --- The stainless steel ash catcher works very well.  (The non-stainless ash catcher on my regular kettle grill didn't work as smoothly and used to catch and jam sometimes.) --- The lid holder is really great.  Just pick up the lid and slide it to the left and it is held in place for you.  No more trying to hang the lid from the little lid hook. --- The thermometer is very handy to monitor temperature for longer cooking items.  If you are BBQing ribs or a roast, keeping the temperature regulated low is important. --- All these little conveniences simply add up to a nice cooking experience. --- I enjoy my gas grill too, but it takes a little more skill to cook over charcoal.  I have a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when I serve up a perfectly cooked meal from my beautiful Weber Performer grill. --- Find a spot to show it off - this beauty really looks great in the yard	pos

The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that "4 the tears in your eyes" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121. ---   	neg
Many thanks to the earlier reviewers who recommended the Amigo.  We bought both the guitar and case for our 5-year-old daughter to take to weekly lessons and we couldn't be happier.

Upon the joyful news that we were having a girl, my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. The digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. While this one prints beautiful pictures, the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes. ---  --- As we all know, this is how printer companies make their money, through the ink. Replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time, give or take a few. The gray ink is used up the quickest, and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. The main problem I have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink, but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. After that. The pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures, let alone ones of your child. Yes, we do what the manual sugests for such occasions, and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads, but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. Every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. In the long run, I will not be buying a photo printer for home use, but will rather take them to a store for processing.  ---  --- Quality-wise, it gets you in the beginning, but doesn't hold out for the long run. We have fiddled with it for two years. Enough's enough	neg

I read the reviews before buying this product, and I do agree that it is messy with the markers, suitable for children that are a little older.

Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is. ---  --- What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in "Class Action" is one you can typify as "David & Goliath", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises	neg

I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it.  He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems.  I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing.  I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps.   --- Overall, the bag is stylish and discreet, the bottles are fabulous (no nipple confusion problems) and I have not had any problems with any part of it.  The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can't keep your milk in the fridge.  I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.  Excellent product and service	pos
James Wong Howe's cinematography looks beautiful on the restored DVD version of this underrated film, an unearthly intervention which brings us the actual physicality of the 19th century in light and radiance.  It was an era in which electric light was just being invented and candles and gaslight were still the norm, that is, among people with the money to afford them.  The unwashed faces of the coal miners and the families they supported form a canvas from Brueghel, but even the whole weight of the mining companies cannot extinguish the inner spark in their eyes. ---  --- Filmed by the Left-leaning director Martin Ritt, freed up from the blacklist that crippled the earlier part of his career, THE MOLLY MAGUIRES finds Ritt at a curious place, picking at the ugly scab of US history that the scandalous MOLLY MAGUIRES represents.  Indeed historians argue whether or not there was ever a conspiracy among Fenians to bring down the oligarchy of the oppressive coal mining companies through so-called "shillelagh law."  Ritt was able to attract not only Richard Harris but top-billed Sean Connery to this project; for each of them a commercial risk.  Indeed the movie, re-edited at the studio by nervous bosses, probably doesn't represent the script that Connery and Harris read.  Samantha Eggar, one of the loveliest of 60s screen actresses, took the leading women's role which was turned down by Anjanette (LOVED ONE) Comer.  Oddly enough, thirty years later, Comer took the minor part of "Sue" in TV's recreation of the nine miners in Pennsylvania who were rescued from the Quecreek cave-in in the summer of 2002. ---  --- Yes, the film is depressing.  Yes, it is slow-moving, sparked by moments of intense brutality.  But give it a chance and savor its unique blend of 1870s locations and 1970 radical filmmaking	pos
Two grandsons (4 years and 6 years)have truly enjoyed this cartridge. Recommend it highly!	pos
I dont know what everyone else's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome!  The graphics are out of this world, and its very suspenseful.  There's a murder or dead body around every corner, and you get to firgure out who did it!  The ending was the best, it took me and my brother at least 24 hours, (not all at once of course), to solve this mystery.  It's a really great buy! ~Andre	pos
Every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime. The characters on the game board are so awesome too. Queen Frosting (that was her name... right?) is so pretty, she was always my favorite character. All in all, it's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child	pos
I have used this product for the past 16 years. It is wonderful!The Super Double Face Powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. The product comes with an application sponge, goes on dry, gives superb coverage! I don't even use my Clinique concelar when I wear this product, it is that good! This product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin.	pos
I needed a document management system. After looking for software, there only appeared to be Paperport.  ---  --- I had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files. I guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least. ---  --- This concerned me, so I called pre-sales at ScanSoft, and asked if it was slow with a large number of files. He was not sure! So he told me to call technical. I called technical, and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me. I asked if he was reading the ScanSoft website and he said yes, so I hung up. Obviously I read their site for an answer, and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it. ---  --- I got the software. Basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software. It worked well, and I thought OK, expensive for what it is, when Windows Explorer and scanning software (usually free) would nearly do most of it, but THEN after around 560 PDFs, it started running VERY slow. ---  --- I thought it was my machine so installed it and the PDFs on a new Vaio 1.7Mhz, 1 gig laptop. Same problem. If you click to view the PDF then hit the return back, it takes 12 seconds! So if you view a document, it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the Paperport Desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds!!! Completely unusuable! ---  --- If you have less than 500 files, it is maybe expensive software, but for more than 500 do not waste you money. It runs so slow you can not use it. I wonder how ScanSoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files	neg
I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday. The lips on the doll didn't work and there really isn't much to do with it. She was bored almost immediately. I was hoping for much more out of this toy. In my opinion you shouldn't waste your money	neg
Gun's & Roses came out in the nick of time. Record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands and they all sound the same. G&R made their debut on the music scene in 87 but didn't get big until almost late 88 early 89. Appitite is a true masterpiece. Welcome to the Jungle, It's So Easy, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle....The list goes on and on. Put it in turn it up to 10 and Rock On! The they made a mistake. they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums. So instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums. Then they vanished. Anyone who is a fan of the music but couldn't care less about Axl should pick up Velvet Revolver with Slash and Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots	pos
David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).  The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role. ---  --- This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people. ---  --- This movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie). ---  --- True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy. ---  --- This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome", and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.) ---  --- Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.   ---  --- In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture. 	pos
The only thing I don't like about it, is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way. Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers	pos
I love eating a lot of cereal in the morning. Like anybody, I really don't choose a cereal that is just good for you, I really choose it for taste. I loved Special K before when it was plain flakes, but I absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries. This cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries. I like how delightful the strawberries taste after I add the milk into the cereal. This is a great buy for anybody who loves Special K cereal, or for anyone who just hasn't considered that special challenge. ---  --- Price: B+ ---  --- Taste: A- ---  --- Overal: B	pos

My experience with this brush has been terrible.  Well, the first two or three days were wonderful.  By the third day, the brush was shedding bristles like mad into my razor.  By the second week, the wooden handle (which does look durable) cracked and the plastic sleeve that holds the bristles popped out--never to go back in again.   I am replacing this brush, sadly, after about 15 uses, and I will be purchasing a more expensive brush, I hope with better results. --- ***Update, a few months later:  I didn't replace the brush.  I super-glued the bristle-sleeve back into the wooden handle.  It eventually stopped shedding bristles, and I have used it successfully since then.  The wooden handle still looks like it will deteriorate quickly as the finish continues to chip off.  Still not recommended, since I don't think I should have to repair a product within the first few weeks of use	neg

This timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn, as the hours, feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life.  While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device.  All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier.  I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example.    I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that.  Then I just go back to sleep.  On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him. ---  --- It's also great for team caregiving, as my husband can hand me the Itzbeen after doing his morning shift, and I automatically know when the last change and bottle were.  We use the wildcard button to track bottle expirations too. ---  --- Thumbs up for the developers of this cool gadget - I hope to see an "Itzbeen II" w/ some advanced features in time for my next baby - although keeping it simple does help keep it easy and quick to use, especially in the fog of a 1am, 3am, and 5am feeding schedule!  (my son never got the memo that full term babies are only supposed to eat every 3 or 4 hours :	pos
When Pokemon first debuted, I thought it would rock, and Misty, Brock, and Ash would stay together as a gang forever, and Ash would love it to just be walking around the world, earning badges, etc., and that's the way it would stay. Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo	neg
This movie tugs at your heart strings in a completely honest way. The movie does not patronise or make pathetic the boy hero who has to endure. It is the very opposite of saccharine glop. ---  --- It is a profoundly optimistic and yet realistic movie. The movie is peppered with memorable eccentric and kind characters. ---  --- 	pos
I bought this for my 3yr old twins, and from the first showing, I kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons.

I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6.	neg

Tom Berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film.  It has the feel and tone of  the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a Sunday afternoon when you're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen.  The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film (when most of the musical scenes occur) are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.  Worse yet, the sets do not look like 1963.  This is very clearly a cheap production, doomed from the start by an awful script, terrible acting, and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era.  Here's the premise of the film: years after Eddie, the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the Cruisers, has disappeared (he died in a car accident, but his body was never recovered), a reporter decides to write a story about the band.  She has a theory that Eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance, if the missing final recordings, named A Season in Hell, can be located.  She forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members, who are, by the way, dull as dirt, to piece together the band's history.  The reporter is so creepy and annoying that she'd probably have a restraining order slapped on her, nowadays.  Ironically enough, A Season in Hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience	neg

Having watched this DVD only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting .The tour de force of Sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed.  The highlight for me was Carol Burnett and the hilarious performance of "Everyone needs a Maid" Only Carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour. --- I do recommend this dvd  and I look forward to veiwing the disc again  on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner	pos
I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try.  ---  --- The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?! ---  --- There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make. ---  --- The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst.	neg

Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry.  She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble.  It is also very sturdy.  She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break.  I would recommend this doll carrier.  It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy	pos
There's really nothing more that can be said to further the reputation of this series of grills.  Those of us that own the Genesis E-310 series grill know how well this grill is manufactured, and just how very well it performs its duties.  It is, by far, the very best gas grill in this price range I have ever owned or used.  A couple of notes: --- -The cross-over ignition system works wonderfully (it takes less than 3 seconds to fire up all three burners --- -Those who say that their gas grill does not get hot enough to sear meats don't own this grill- I've had it up to 550 degrees on a very cold MN winter day --- -That said, it seems to go through a good amount of propane when running all 3 burners on high...but that is probably obvious considering the temps you can obtain when running it on full.  (It will be interesting to see if I can get 500 + degrees to sear meats on medium setting on a summer day....).  The fuel gauge inside the cabinet is also a handy feature --- -As always with this series of grills- No Flare ups, and the flavorizer bars do what Weber says they will, namely vaporize fats and juices into smoke that adds flavor to what you are grilling --- -To keep this review balanced, there is one negative- I dislike the tool holders.  Although there are plenty, your tools pretty much have to have one of those leather hanging loop things to keep the tools from falling off or even to use the holders (a small price to pay I guess) ---  --- Finally, the Genesis E-310 I purchased came in a copper color, something I haven't seen on Amazon, or on Weber's site for that matter.  Maybe I missed it, or maybe I got lucky.  Either way, it looks pretty darn sharp on our deck when it isn't covered	pos

With five kids under the age of 9 and four Leapsters in the house, there is rarely a time when someone isn't playing one (if not all!) of them. We have about 10 of the cartridges, and this was the most disappointing (followed closely by Spiderman). There simply isn't enough for them to do with it. The beauty of the Leapster is the ability to interact with the games, and learn while they do it. Watching a video on a 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it.	neg
Received the 'first' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote.  Played MP3's, mov, and displayed pictures fine.  Would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working.  Returned this unit and received a second which didn't work, didn't even have a remote or speakers (561 in a 562 box?).  Time for another replacement - which came without remote, with speakers, but faulty software or micro?  Menu's one deep were blank rectangles which didn't function and MP3's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files.  Actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be OK functionally, but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu's and faulty functionality.  E-mailed Digital Spectrum and have not received a reply, which actually led me to write this feedback!  Hard to believe this company will survive if they don't straighten up their act	neg

I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11.  ---  --- So now here we are on X3.  Let me tell you, It has been 5 years since could say I love this program! It loads faster than 11 or 12 (and about a bizillion times faster than Adobe's Illustrator).  ---  --- It seems in this version, Corel has really given it's users a good listen because the additions to this program bring draw up to a new level of "I can harldy wait to work on a new project". ---  ---  Many of the improvments are simply little things in the way of navigation and shortcuts.

What a brilliant package!  It's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end, and has a twist on lid.  No spills, no mess, no disaster.  Love it! ---  --- It is easy to apply with the brush.  I have Lava Flow, which is a shimmery pink.  The shimmer is a more obvious than I would like, as it's big flecks of sparkle, but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue.  There is a strong smell and taste, sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant, it is powerful.  Kinda reminds me of red Koolaid.  The color is a bright pink when first applied, but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer.  In the container the color looks unwearable, but in reality it isn't dramatic.   ---  --- The only drawback is how sticky it feels.  It is less sticky than Mac's Lipglass, but more so than Urban Decay XXX, if that makes sense.   ---  --- I got this as a freebie and I'm glad I got to try it.  I would buy it but in a different color	pos
This is Beck's coming of age album.  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation.  His earlier recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius.   ---  --- "Mellow Gold" might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for Beck.  If that's the case, then "Mutations" was his rite of passage, a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album.  "Mutations" has dark, brooding moments with haunting melodies.   ---  --- His lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness.   In one song, he sings, "Looking back on some dead world, that looks so new."  We can't always be sure of his references or implications, but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful.  His ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful.   ---  --- With "Mutations," Beck has secured an important place in music history.  This is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play.  The arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft.     	pos

Here's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set (i.e., K - 3rd).  Every science kit, including this one, basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and "Voila!" you made a volcano.  Nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of Mt. St. Helen's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products.  Use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors? You guessed it -- food dye.  All these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards.

Dear Film Company Jackasses, ---  --- Surely you know we already hate you for your greed - Why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like "The Great Santini" and cutting them to Full Screen? ---  --- Yet another fine film marred, no doubt, by some big company's desire to cut corners.

I was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years, yet wasn't going to take years to pay for!  (HA! HA!)  This is a nice checkbook cover for the money.  My only complaint is that it needs to have a "tab" to keep your check register open to the page you are working on.  However, it does have a "loop" to keep a pen inside, you should desire to do so.  All in all, a good buy	pos

this game is just freakin' awesome.  im not that big into video games, and i really only play them when i have someone to play against... i stay away from one player mode because i get bored and cannot talk smack.  then came duty.  i played this game through on all the difficulty modes, from medium up and never got bored.  plus, if you've got a nice group of folk to play with and a way to separate screens to prevent looking, multiplayer is sweet (esp if you break up into teams) and you can talk smack all day long.  best graphics and gameplay of any game ive ever seen	pos
Blue Note was on the mark to re-release this classic. Tina Brook's style of blues laced jazz is a sound that will bring joy to your soul. A must have CD for any jazz collection	pos
As others have noted, this was a time of turmoil for the group. Now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had just lost guitarist/singer Bob Weston and singer Dave Walker), they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with Martin Birch on. This CD also leans really heavily on material from Bob Welch (this would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply for that. ---  --- Most of the few highlights here are furnished by Christine McVie. The title cut is a nice lament about male prevarication. The understated "Prove Your Love" is also a winner. Of the Welch contributions, the only real standouts are the mystical "Bermuda Triangle" and gentle closer "Safe Harbour". ---  --- There are plenty of miscues, filler, and outright bad material here. McVie's "Come a Little Bit Closer" is produced like it WANTS to be a hit, but it's much too slight to stick in the memory. Welch's "She's Changing Me" sounds like Chicago colliding with the Mac...the horns don't work here. The handclap bridge in "Silver Heels" seems too poppy and out of place in the context of the rest of the tune, which is execrable anyway. ---   --- The silver lining to this disc is that what might have been a death knell turned into the band's finest hour just one album later..	neg

This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele.

However, I have to admit I was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing	neg
Hottest Sauce in the Universe: no brag, just fact. I find that a single drop of Dave's Ultimate Insanity is more than equivalent to TEN drops of Tabasco. Why not five stars? While this sauce gives new meaning to the term extreme heat, I find the taste of Tabasco more pleasant. Ultimate Insanity adds a hint of a smokey/burnt flavor, which I assume is due to the roasted peppers. Try it for yourself..this the most heat you can get without notifying the Fire Marshall	pos

 i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star.	neg
Okay were to start. This car seat looks good on paper but that is it. When it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it.If you have the LATCH system in your car you must find, and shove all the belts inside the seat.  Then pull them out the correct places.  Not so easy.  Then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached, slide it back.  This is very hard.  So once there together it is a pain to take apart. ---  --- For facing backwards, if the seat is not level with your car seats, use a towel or blanket.  You shouldn't have to do that.  Plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat.  Once you turn it forward, to get the belts adjusted, you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you.  This would work fine if the BASE wasn't holding them so you CAN'T MOVE THEM.  We took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts.  What is the point of that.   ---  --- Once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it's purpose but I highly suggest buying something of better quality.  	neg

I used to buy this off the shelf each month, but last November, my wife bought me a subscription.   I bought the December issue,...cause it hadn't arrived by mail yet. No problem.  In January, I received the November issue.   A few weeks later, in early February, I received the December issue, but not the January, so I went out and bought the January.   By the end of February, still hadn't received the Feb yet, so bought it.  Then, received the January issue and a few weeks later the February.   I was fed up.   I know they were getting 'caught up', but not only was I getting editions that I'd already bought off the shelf, but I figured these were counting against my 12 issues.     I cancelled.  They deducted a few bucks from my refund for "issues received" and had no apologies for the mess. ---  --- I like the magazine, but I will say that if you read it over time, it become redundant.   The suggested work-outs are mostly rehashes of past work-out routines.  Lets face it...there are only so many ways to work out and when you get right down to it, you gotta hit it hard and often, change things up, etc...bla bla bla...   The BEST part of the magazine are the few pages they dedicate to the correct way to execute a lift or detail what muscles are hit.   Lots of Weider ads...but then its a Weider publication, so what can you expect... ---  --- I'd buy it off the shelf because you'll eventually get tired of the same old thing...and their subscription program is iffy. ---  --- -	neg

I had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given.  ---   Before I purchased this software, I checked out 5-6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic, (movement, background, lighting, and noise).  I have two computers, one 800 mHz the other 1.4 gHz processor and the program runs perfect on both.  The goldfish screensaver is just as impressive, if you're into that kind of fish.  Don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds, the quality in all aspects, especially 3d-graphics and color (which are a must if your looking for realism), are poor.  I personally thought I'd like the extra fish and backgrounds (turtles in particular) in a competitors screen saver, so I purchased it instead of this one.  After trying it, I was very disapointed and luckily I was able to receive a refund.  I purchased Marine Aquariun and have never regretted it since.  What's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too	pos
Can't understand what all the fuss is over this movie. It's cute but so boring. I could hardly stay awake.	neg
The novel, A Northern Light, by Jennifer Donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl, bound for a great future.  Jennifer Donnelly relates to Mattie Gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of New York.  Donnelly attended the University of Rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. Her novels include, The Tea Rose, The Winter Rose, A Northern Light, and a children's book, Humble Pie. All of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, A Northern Light, has also been introduced in Europe under the title A Gathering Light. ---  A Northern Light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth, education, love, and murder.  The combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to.  As you read this book, you feel like the main message is the traditional cliché of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. But as you read further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength and love.  On the first page of the book, Mattie is imagining a perfect day at the Glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself, "I believe these things. With all my heart.  For I am good at telling myself lies".  From this quote, you can see the type of person Mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel.  The events typically consist of let down after let down for Mattie and her hopes for her future.    ---  This book is written from Mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better.  It adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from Mattie's point of view.  It lets you get inside Mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.  Mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. She's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. As you read this book, you just want to tell Mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith.  She is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well.  She deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died.  She has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well.  Royal Loomis enters Mattie's life at a very unconventional time when Mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted.  Mattie deals with her teacher, Miss Wilcox, leaving town.  Miss Wilcox was Mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.  The life Mattie wants.     ---  This book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand.  It's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children.  The issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families.  A Northern Light is full of valuable lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in. ---  ---  ---    --- 	neg

Enough already! ---  --- One more time. Now, what was I saying?  ---  --- Oh, yeah ... Pinnacle Studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running. ---  --- Got the idea? ---  --- Just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the Pinnacle products. This is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions.  ---  --- After installing the program, installing the patches, uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches, I am still experiencing too many crashes. ---  --- If you intend to use this program to piece together a video of Uncle Morty's birthday party, the family vacation or your neighbor's kid's bar mitzvah, the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness. If, however, your video projects fit under the category of "job description," then I suggest spending the money for Adobe Premiere	neg
These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine.

If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product	neg

I installed Norton Antivirus 2007 immediately after installing Windows Vista, Office 2007 and other software on a new computer.  Installation ran smoothly.  LiveUpdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch. ---  --- Norton AntiVirus 2007 not only detects viruses, it detects spyware and rootkits as well.  It has an inbound firewall, and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities.  It does not protect against phishing, identity theft, or spam, nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection. ---  --- When installed on Windows Vista, Norton Antivirus takes over for Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall.  I did not expect the latter; Symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall.  Norton AntiVirus integrates well with Windows Security Center. ---  --- Norton AntiVirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions. Norton AntiVirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products. The only other product that I would use myself is McAfee VirusScan, but I have always felt that Norton AntiVirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system. ---  --- For those of you installing Norton AntiVirus 2007 as an upgrade, I would highly recommend that you first remove any existing Norton security products using Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  Then, download and run the  Norton Removal Tool from the Symantec site to make sure that it's all gone. ---  --- To see a comparison chart of the Norton 2007 Windows protection products as of this posting date, browse to Symantec's site, click on "Norton 2007 Products" under Home Products, click on related link "View All Products" and then click "Compare" next to PC Security. --- 	pos

When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft.  Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat	pos

This watch is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the picture. The case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic, but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size. It certainly doesn't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be. I have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools. Atomic time reception is good even as far south as I am and it rarely misses updates. You can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy.  What is not easy is the initial setup.  I've never had to really read a manual on most electronics, but you will need it with this one.  Keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies.  At least for now, the price is a deal for the functionality and quality	pos
Castlevania as a whole started with one thing in mind. . . kill the vampire plaquing the land.  The same can be said about Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.  You play as Hector, a devilforge master.  What's a Devil Forge master you ask?  A person with the ablity to create monsters/and or weapons.  Devil forge masters in this game have the same amount of power as Dracula's right hand man, Death.  Huge 3D like invorments(like from LOI), wild monsters, gorgeous graphics, and a suporior sound track help Hector along the way to get revenge for the love of his life Rosaly.  As far as story line time, this happens a little after Castlevania 3: Dracula's curse.  So in other words, you old school guys(like me) will enjoy seeing what happeded after Castlevania 3.  Pick it up today, you will NOT BE SORRY.  Oh yea did I mention, that you get to play as Trevor Belmont?  Oh I didn't, good luck, and make Dracula pay!!	pos
This volume contains 152 middle length sutras which are mainly sermons to monks on buddhist practices.  Having compared the Pali original with the translation of about 12 Sutras I would give it a high fidelity rating.  The appendix contains extensive notes which discuss the text from the viewpoint of the Theravada commentaries.  A must read for those who want to learn or study using original source material and do not read Pali.  The introduction contains valuable material on Buddhism by a Bhikkhu long "gone-forth".  	pos

A little known documentary that is both entertaining and informative. Touching first hand accounts and rare footage that give an extraordinary look at both Mr. Welles and the Brazilian culture.

For all you non-believers out there, BUY THIS GAME! I was like you...reading the reviews, looking at the box in various stores, pondering, considering, thinking to myself, "should I buy this game?" Now that I finally spent the mere $20 and played the game, I am wondering why I didn't do so sooner. As an avid Playstation supporter, (Stood in line for hours and paid over $600 for my PS2 back in the day), this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment. Cinematically driven storyline, supurbly coordinated character control, creative levels and character design, great soundtrack, decent bosses, pretty cool power moves, and, (importantly), puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen...except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns. In closing, all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review...BUY THIS GAME	pos

After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead.

If you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback, this is the product to buy. Packaging, support, presentation, and hardware/software quality are the best that I have seen.  No down side.

When con man and general loser Eric Stanton (Dana Andrews) drifts into the small California ocean-side town of Walton late one night, he has dollar in his pocket and few prospects. Stanton wanders into the only diner open, Pops, to get a cup of coffee and something to eat. He meets Mr. Judd (Charles Bickford), a retired New York cop, and the waitress, Stella (Linda Darnell). Stanton soon finds himself up to his eyes in three things he didn't expect. He didn't expect to fall for Stella, a sullen beauty who is prepared to sell what men want for a wedding ring and a good life. He didn't expect to find himself on the run for Stella's murder...with a wife, June Mills (Alice Faye), a woman he married for her money so that he and Stella could eventually be together. Not only are the Walton cops after him, they've signed up Judd to help out, a smart, tough man who doesn't hesitate to punch up a suspect if that's what he thinks is needed. And Stanton sure didn't expect to ever find himself in a situation he couldn't talk himself out of.    ---  --- The one thing that struck me about this movie is how much of a hole in the center Alice Faye leaves. Her June Mills is so bland and vanilla that her character is just not very interesting. She loves Stanton, she's loyal, she's convinced not only that Stanton is innocent, but that he has the ability to change his life into something worthwhile. In other words, June Mills is so noble she's boring. This may be the way the part was written, but Faye doesn't seem to have the acting ability to add some edge around the words. Having to compete with Linda Darnell's lush sullenness was beyond Faye's abilities. It would have been interesting, for instance, to see Ann Sheridan as June Mills, speaking the same lines. That leaves the three main characters who, for me, were hard to feel much for: Stella, who'll take you to the cleaners before she'll take you to bed; June, who'll probably want to pray with you every night before you climb into bed; and Eric Stanton, a weak con man who often gets caught up in his own cons.  ---  --- One other weakness for me is that it is easy to spot the killer, but his comeuppance only came about in a fast last three minutes of the movie. The reason for the killing is nice and tawdry, but I wish that we'd had one or two strong red herrings to chew on. There were a lot of possible candidates but they were left floating alone by themselves. ---  --- I liked the way the small town of Walton looked and was photographed, tidy and boring. The opening of the movie -- the state highway speeding by at night with the credits appearing as signs -- was nicely atmospheric. Stanton's conning of June into having her fall for him was great. The screenwriter hit just the right notes of sincerity, friendliness and charm, all of which was a little too practiced. It was fun watching Stanton in action. He thinks of himself as able to talk anyone into anything. Dana Andrews and the lines he says make it believable. ---  --- One of the strengths of the movie now is the range of fine character actors who show up. To name a few, in addition to Bickford, there's John Carradine, Percy Kilbride, Bruce Cabot, Jimmy Conlin and Olin Howland. You may not recognize all the names, but if you're fond of old movies you'll recognize the faces. And Anne Revere does a fine job as Clara, June Mills' older and protective sister. Revere was a plain looking, raw-boned woman and a first-rate actress. She was one of many whose film careers were destroyed in the Hollywood witch-hunts of the late Forties and Fifties.   ---  --- Fallen Angel is a minor noir, but worth a look. The DVD presentation is just fine. There are a couple of minor extras, and a commentary by Eddie Muller, described as a noted film noir historian, and Dana Andrews daughter, Susan Andrews. I didn't listen to it. The case contains a small, four-page booklet that gives insights into the movie	pos

I just finished HL2 on the Xbox and thought some of my observations might be helpful to other prospective buyers. My review is primarily concerned with my struggle between getting HL2 for PC or Xbox. I bought HL, HL Opposing Force and HL Blue Shift for the PC when they came out and thoroughly enjoyed them. Due to the HL2 Xbox price and the horror stories I'd read about having to be online to use the PC version of HL2, I decided to go for the Xbox version. Did I make the right choice? ---  --- HL2 is a very good game and at $20 for the Xbox version, represents excellent value for money. Great graphics, great sound and engaging game play. However, I think HL1 on the PC is a better game than HL2 on Xbox. Why?  ---  --- First, the original HL was much more open ended and there was often more than one way to do something or get somewhere. With HL2, I found there was only one way.  ---  --- Second, the controls for HL1 were better and configurable. With HL2 on Xbox, I found some controls to be really awkward and difficult to use. For example, there's an air boat to drive and the direction and throttle are on the same thumb stick. I assume throttle and direction are separate keys on the PC version?  ---  --- Third, when there's a lot going on, for example, several Combine soldiers firing at you, explosions and a fair bit of scenery to display, the Xbox slowed down to almost a halt! It just couldn't cope with that amount of processing. I never had that problem with HL1 on the PC and assume a suitably equipped PC could cope with HL2 just as well.  ---  --- Lastly, as others have mentioned you didn't have to go very far in HL2 before you saw a `loading' screen. The frequency at which you saw this did become distracting and annoying after a while. One plus for HL2 is there's no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there was in HL1. Remember all that hopping from floating platform to floating platform and plants that light up when you went near them? All that nonsense has gone away which was a relief! ---  --- On reflection, most of my gripes about HL2 have more to do with the Xbox version rather than the game itself. If I had to choose again, I'd buy HL2 on the PC and will certainly get any HL2 spin off games for the PC if they are to appear like they did for HL1. If not, I'll wait for HL3 which the ending of HL2 leaves open. 	pos

This book of eight stories by Virginia Woolf shows Virginia's mind at work demonstrating her "stream of consciousness." Each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life.  For  example, "The Mark on the Wall" questions the meaning of life and  existence.  "An Unwritten Novel" is about what people hide and  what you don't know about a person you seat next to on an  "omnibus."  All these stories will make you look at life in a  slightly different way	pos

I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one	neg
I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner  way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself	neg

Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent.  I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute.  After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees... I realized how great this thing was.  Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm.  No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps!  also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great!  This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion.  My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring.  Not to mention, not a day goes by that I don't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it.  Love it Love it	pos

This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments. ---  --- The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value. ---  --- I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers. Indeed, forget Nikon and go to Canon	neg
Lisa Rinna and Gail O'Grady become best friends..not realizing that they share the same man!  Both women perform very well in this movie...I have been a big fan of both of them since Melrose Place and NYPD Blue.  Sally Kirkland also does a great job in this movie as Gail O'Grady's mother.  This movie is filled with so many different ingredients: intrigue, lessons on overcoming fears, and it helps one become stronger in believing inside what can truly make your life happy.  I've seen it a few times, and enjoy it more each time	pos

About the Band: --- Dead Can Dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre.  In fact, the name of the label, 4AD, which carried many of the 1990s DCD releases, is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music, which is a fusion of subtle electronics, vocals, drums, world music, and a near limitless count of instruments.  Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank Sinatra.  Lisa Gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to Lisa.  I count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem. ---  --- About the Album: --- Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks, the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short, if it weren't for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and over again.  I count this album as one of my all time favorites, and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD. ---  --- One of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both Lisa's and Brendan's ghostly vocals.  On some tracks they accompany each other, while others feature only one of the artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals.  Simply put, this is beautiful music to relax to.  I honestly give this album my highest recommendations! ---  --- Two tracks I'd recommend sampling: "Towards the Within" (featuring Lisa's vox w/ Brendan backing) and "Tell Me About the Forest" (featuring Brendan's vox).  I believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album.  Please note that while all the tracks feature vocals, the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in the liner notes. ---  --- Similar Artists: --- Chances are if you aren't yet familiar with Dead Can Dance, that you've not yet discovered some of these other bands, but I highly recommend them as well: Das Zeichen, Impressions of Winter, Love is Colder Than Death, Qntal, Corvus Corax, or Helium Vola.  There is a rather large (and somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance.  Please check some of them out as well.	pos

Ahh, "Iron Eagle".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/"current" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.   ---  --- The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base "network" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end. ---  --- Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy.	neg
Not so many words to talk about this item, but let me tell you that now I always use my rino turned on, in my car. baterie drain its no more cash pain! ---  --- **Good things: --- -comes with a led(small light) that turns on with diferent colors(red green yellow) so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected. --- -large cable(for a car, you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car) ---  --- **bad things --- just a bad ending quality, it looks like a adapter of 2.99bucks, but I had owned it for more than a year and cero problems. ---  --- pvpaco@gmail.co	pos
Although this isn't the most polished movie, it is genuinely entertaining, and only someone not remotely interested in seeing a romantic comedy would give it 0-1 stars. ---  --- I can't remember why I first picked it up (I didn't see it in the theaters), but it is a consistently funny, touching film.  I'm not a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, Elle MacPherson (who I feel turns in the strangest, poorest performance of the bunch), or even Ben Stiller, but I think it's easy to identify with people so afraid to be in love, but so afraid not to be in a committed relationship. ---  --- All in all, it's a bunch of laughs, and kind of a relief to watch something that takes itself less seriously than some of the big-name romantic comedies that are put out today and fall flat	pos
This Jet Li movie is thus far the best movie since Shaolin Temple as Younger Jet Li. Its awesome surreal fighting creates this Epic feel to the whole Genre of martial arts fighting. Jet Li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie. It has laughter, suspense, compassion, and innocense. The most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the Witches pawn. This film is highly recommended to those who love Jet Li and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. An Excellent movie to add to the Jet Li collection	pos

In my opinion:  --- I own a ton of Panasonic equipment, most recently a DVD recorder. I was using Sony DVD-Rs with no problems, but, being a Panasonic person, I figured Panasonic must be better.  ---  --- In order to save a few bucks, I joined the Panasonic Club at the Panasonic website, and ordered a spindle of these same type DVD-Rs. I did this on 9/20/06.  ---  --- I made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were, and, believe it or not, nobody at Panasonic could tell me why they hadn't been shipped. Then, I was promised that they did ship, but I never got them. After being talked into placing a duplicate order by a Panasonic Rep, I didn't get that order either.  ---  --- I finally received one order on 10/16/06. They were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken. Now, I finally had my discs. Guess what? They were only 1-8x speed (the Sony discs were 1-16x speed), and my thermal label printer wouldn't print on them because of the finish. I had been assured that I could print on them with a thermal printer.  ---  --- I did burn a couple of movies, and they worked, but I saw nothing special that I can report.  ---  --- It gets worse: I logged into my Panasonic Club account, and saw two charges I hadn't made: one for $10,017 and one for $915. I fell off the back of my chair. To this day nobody has called me, but I managed to get some email responses, and I was told I would have to watch my credit card - that's just what I need!  ---  --- You know, sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a Company it is, and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were.  ---  --- I'm going back to Sony, and let me tell you, Amazon Customer Service blows away just about every company I've dealt with (sorry about the preposition). I should have bought on Amazon.  ---  ---  --- 	neg
Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages	neg
Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off. ---  --- Office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me. I felt that the improvements were minimal (aside from a bit more stability in Word--anyone who has ever used Word 97 on a regular basis knows it's prone to crashing) and in fact detracted from the ease of use. One example is the clip gallery, which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn't have received decent reviews in 1988. Another is PowerPoint's outline feature. I always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller. When you use smaller displays like I often do this is a problem. The menus, which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them, were also an annoyance. The manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size. ---  --- Office 2003 continues making the program uglier. Now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen. Again, this eats into the workspace. The clip art system is even more cumbersome, and many of the clips are online only now. The help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well. Now some people may not complain, but what if you're using a laptop in the middle of the country? ---  --- I feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. In fact, the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful. On my Macs, I've switched to Keynote for presentations and Pages for some of my word processing because the new Office versions on that platform are similar. ---  --- Some of the templates also look very 1997. Apple's programs are updated on a regular basis, and their templates look very modern. Now I know Microsoft adds some new ones now and then, but they should consider redesigning many of them--such as replacing the overused Arial and Times New Roman fonts with something a little more classy. ---  --- The program is bloated way too heavily. I can run Office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1GB hard drive, but can't even get 2003 on it. ---  --- A final gripe is that Access is not user friendly at all. File Maker is a better alternative, as it is easier to use and friendlier	neg

If you are expecting a HUGE Chiminea, then move on.  But if you want a medium sized one that is easy to assemble and good looking then this is the item for you.  It took about 10 minutes to put together with two people (and I am not mechanically inclined) and it feels very solid, not flimsy or cheap.  It is probably about 30 lbs.  I used one half of a Duraflame (fake fire log) in this chiminea the first time I used it and I was glad I did.  The burning area is kind of small and if I had used a full log I would have had an inferno!  Even with the small log, the flames lept out of the unit a bit so keep it away from anything flammable.  Maybe regular wood/sticks would work better I don't know, I have yet to try that. --- Overall, I am happy with the item because it is a nice convenient size, works well and looks very nice	pos

I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer.  Back then, I had a really slow computer, and it didn't work right.  I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it.  It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years.  Now I have a better computer and play it all the time.  The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult, not so.  The guy must have obviously been a moron, and not been able to figure out the puzzles, because the game has an average difficulty, and if he wants it easier, he can play on Padawan.  Anyway, the game is basically a first person shooter based game, where you go around blasting storm troopers, probe droids, and more.

I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable	pos

I was extremely disappointed with this product; I felt very let down by Sony, because for years I bought Sony items with confidence, knowing that anything produced by them would be good and reliable.  This item only goes to prove that Sony's standards have dropped and, as such I will use considerable caution when buying anthing else of theirs. --- What lets this product down is the lack of distance one can be before the sound breaks up; 2 metres (not 45 metres as stated on the wrapping) was the best I could do, and that was in a straight line.  No, all this item is fit for is the rubbish bin	neg
The idea of the stroller is great. However after purchasing and using it, it isn't well equipped.

Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.	neg

Fantasy&ScienceFiction magazine has been around since 1949, and is in my opinion one of the better SciFi and fantasy mags on the market. It has a proven track record of publishing outstanding short stories, novellas, and novelettes that have later gone on to win Hugo, Nebula, and dark fantasy awards, which brings me to the 2006 June issue of the magazine: The June issue features an outstanding and very creepy novella entitled Hallucigenia by Laird Barron. I predict an award for this chilling novella, which will be just another in a long and esteemed list of award worthy tales from Fantasy&ScienceFiction. --- Barron's story could be classed as a Cthulhu Mythos tale, although no where does the author allude to H.P. Lovecraft's works. It is simply that the recurring theme is a recognizable one to us Mythos fans. --- Highly recommended reading, and worth the subscription price.  	pos

MY FAVORITE WIFE is not among the very best comedies of pre-war Hollywood, but it is nonetheless quite excellent, driven by a strong script, superb lead performers, and a number of great character performances.  Cary Grant is the finest comic actor film has produced and this film demonstrates that as well as any.  Though he was equally as good in classics such as BRINGING UP BABY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, those films were so marvelously directed, so superbly well written, and filled with such an overabundance of great actors that one might not notice just how outstanding Grant was (that is not the case with HIS GIRL FRIDAY, where even among an embarrassment of riches, Grant stands out and dominates the film).  Here Grant is surrounded by fewer talented actors, is working with a slightly less superb (though still quite good) script, and is directed by the writer instead of the director originally scheduled for the project.  Originally the plan was to reunite Grant, Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey, the big threesome of the classic 1937 screwball THE AWFUL TRUTH.  Unfortunately, McCarey had a car wreck just before shooting was begun and was unable to be on the set.  Canin did a good if not spectacular job.  Unlike his fellow writers Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges, both of whom became fulltime directors of their own scripts around this time, Canin primarily remained a writer for the rest of his career. ---  --- Still, the film was more successful than it should have been, mainly because of Cary Grant, though Irene Dunne was certainly a strong presence as his costar.  But in rewatching the film, it becomes obvious that almost all of the great comic moments are Grant's.  What is remarkable is that he essentially plays a coward.  The plot is simple.  A man goes before a judge to get his wife declared dead after she has been missing for several years, apparently drowned in the Indian Ocean, so that he will be free to remarry.  The judge grants the request and then marries them, but of course the next scene shows the wife who has been declared dead arriving at her home, just after being rescued (why she wouldn't have called first isn't explained).  Learning that her husband has remarried and is about to go on his honeymoon, she follows after.  Much of the humor of the film revolves around cowardice, Grant's inability to tell his new wife that his old wife has miraculously returned from the dead, and Dunne's reticence to tell him that she had been stranded on the island with beefcake Randolph Scott.  That really is about all the plot there is.  They manage to get a lot of mileage out of Grant's inability to come out and say what he wants.  He is the epitome of the incommunicative male.  The film is also enlivened by a number of superb supporting actors.  Virtually none of the great comedies off the studio era in Hollywood failed to feature a group of first rate character actors.  Here the two that most stand out are Granville Bates as the Judge in a magnificently performed role and Donald MacBride as the exasperated, confused, and highly suspicious hotel clerk. ---  --- The film is interesting for the pairing of Cary Grant and Randolph Scott, about whom rumors have circulated for decades.  I've never seen any good evidence that either was gay or bisexual or involved with one another, but the rumors have persisted nonetheless.  The primary "evidence" seems to have been that while they were roommates during the 1930s they were unusually good housekeepers, keeping their apartment meticulous.  Why neatness should be evidence of homosexuality I am not sure, but we know for a fact that both Grant and Scott dated women extensively through the thirties, but there is no evidence whatsoever of any physical relationship between the two.  Sadly, the rumors of their having had a relationship apparently took a toll on their friendship.  This film was made well after the rumors had begun but after they had ceased rooming together and well before their friendship largely ended. ---  --- All in all, this is one of the more enjoyable comic films of the age.  It isn't a classic in the mold of HIS GIRL FRIDAY or BRINGING UP BABY or THE LADY EVE, but it is nonetheless an exceptionally easy to like and enjoy film featuring great performers at their peak.   ---  --- Note:  If one scans the reviews below one will note several mentions of colorized versions.  I believe that these refer to the old VHS versions.  Amazon often meshes reviews of DVDs with older reviews of VHS versions of films.  As far as I know--though I could certainly be mistaken--I do not think this has ever been released on DVD in colorized form.  At any rate, the current retail version is certainly in pristine black and white.  So don't be afraid that you are about to purchase a colorized film	pos

Alliterative Analogies, assertively  assembled, appear aplenty, appropriately, apt and artful, absorbing attention ad infinitum. This could be a fitting summary of Abish's stunningly "now" novel, written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between Kabbala and alliteration. Chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter A, Chapter 2 with A and B and so on until chapter 27, when Z first, then chapter by chapter all other letters, are progressively subtracted. In spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature, the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary, they may have been culled from today's headlines: polysexually inclined thugs hide in Africa after a crime spree, with the Author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them. Chasing after the thugs from country to country, we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite, war and genocide, corrupted burocrats and soldiers, rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air, where sparsely assembled people wollow in African Indolence. All is narrated with poetic detachment, in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social, political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality: it is just that the words were limited by my artifice, reader, the Author seems to smile. No harm intended. Perhaps: the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974, to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy. Great art, when unhindered, relates to the whole of time, in all tenses. While amusing, Abish has managed a ponderous read, which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices, inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events. Attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme. And wonder: was it accidental?

Based on Bizet's tragic Spanish opera, this was Rita Hayworth's first film made by her production company, Beckworth (derived from her screen surname and from the name of her daughter, Rebecca). She decided on her close friend and favorite leading man, Glenn Ford, as Don Jose to her Carmen. The results are far better than some reviews would have you believe. ---  --- The glorious, lush Techincolor is fabulous (studio-bound as most of the sets may be), while Hayworth's unforgettable screen presence, dancing and bewitching beauty, and the heat generated between her and Ford makes this movie memorable. The sequence in which she describes what virtues a lover should have (complete with putting her finger to his lips) sparkles with sensual static. Granted, Ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform (after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his "bandit clothing", he appears much more relaxed). ---  --- If it is deemed worthy enough to be released as part of the Columbia Classics collection, so should "Affair In Trinidad", another Hayworth/Ford collaboration. ---  --- It's just great to look at, flaws aside. If you adore Rita and Glenn, even in a tempestuous, volatile romance, this movie will provide that for you. ---  --- Was there ever a more enticing, tempestous gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and ultimately tragic love?  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  	pos
To begin with, I wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol!  That said, this is a rare case (the 1st of its kind?) of a movie being better than the play it was based on.  The general framework was of course the same, but in the play Judy Holliday's part was taken by Josephine Hull, a very funny little old lady (who also scored both on Bway and on the screen in "Harvey" and "Arsenic and Old Lace," to name the only 2 that I know of), and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges, it blossomed in the film.  One problem, there simply were no witty lines, either in the play or the movie.  This is odd for Kaufman (though the play was produced in 1953, very late in his career), but about par for Burrows (early in his career).  But still it was clever and interesting, the play had more structure than the movie (typical of Kaufman), but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play, which surprised me very much and made me wonder about Kaufman.  Also the flick left out all the naughty words which I'm sure Hull barked out with delicious abandon!  (Note:  Kaufman co-wrote the play, Burrows adapted it for the screen.)  This I think was more a sit-com than an actually witty Kaufman comedy.  And finally, Judy Holliday did NOT play a "dumb blonde"!  She only did that in "Born Yesterday.	pos

They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a "fact-checker", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking.  For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars	pos

Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.   ---  --- However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again.  There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced.  We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed.  But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.	neg

If you can't get enough of zombie comedies this year, I seriously recommend this one, made in the Czech Republic of all places! I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival (NY) and it was tremendous fun. Bloody, funny, and smart. An intellectual twist on the "secluded retreat" idea - a group gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of their lives. And of course, they're overrun by zombies. ---  --- I especially love the way the film weaves between existential exploration and hilarious gore-fest. It works on so many different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly visceral, your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes, the interesting characters, and the joyful way it plays with film conventions. ---  --- This is a rare and unusual film to come out of the Czech Republic. I was disappointed that it didn't get a theatrical release in the US, so I'm really glad that it's coming out on DVD. Humor/horror fans will not be disappointed!	pos
Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!

The story gets a bit complicated because it deals a little bit with law issues. The real problem is that most of us get kind of frightened when we face something unusual in our daily lives. I had to watch the movie's end twice in order to understand well how the bad guys were going to be punished. I wonder what lawyers, FBI agents and mafia members would think when watching this movie.  ---  --- Most of us don't know much about legal issues but are still interested in thrillers, and this movie shows a rather believable and very fun plot. The good guy, Mitch McDeere, wins over evil not only because he's smart but also because of a big deal of good luck. Mitch is so lucky that the story strains credibility.For example, Mitch's wife gets to know all of a sudden that Gene Hackman's character (who has important documents to copy) is not going to dive as Mitched though so she saves the days by showing up to distract him. Well, good luck tends to favor people with drive in real life.   At the same time the movie shows legal procedures made-up by real life lawyer John Grisham.  ---  --- The movie is also realistic in the way the bad guys are punished. In real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go to jail, even less killed by the good guys; everybody knows this. What not everybody knows is that these crooks can still face problems. The movie shows the sort of legal and money problems they get involved into. ---  --- Finally, the suspense is well organized. Moreover the piano and instrumental music goes really well in those scenes.  ---  --- Yes, this is very compelling movie to recommend watching. Beware that this movie deals at some degree with the Conservative vs Liberal cultural war. The bad guys had to be the Southern Conservatives who want to rule other people's lives according to their own hypocrite standards. Meanwhile the good guys are Liberals from NE. I wondered how writer John Grisham could portray his own Southern fellows in negative ways. All I guess is that JG realized what would be accepted by the Entertainment industry and wrote according to it. Anyways, this is just a movie and it does what it's supposed to do: to entertain	pos
This is a great game for two players (and two players only).  The first one or two times I played, it was very, very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in.  However, once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you, games tend to take about an hour.  It's a fairly involved game, so you have to be in the mood for that.  There's a lot of strategy and many ways to win.  I greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games.  It might be daunting for a really casual gamer, though.  If you like it, there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original	pos

After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased.  ---  --- The last camera I had was an older Sony DSC that was quite bulky, ran on batteries, and had shutter problems--but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect, so I thought I would go for the DSCT5, since it avoids ALL of those problems. Only a tiny battery to charge, no sticky shutter... and it's sexy as hell. The screen is huge and very bright.  ---  --- I hate taking pictures with flash in general, and I find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera. (And the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything) However! You can easily change this by going into the over/under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments. They come out surprisingly well and blur-free	pos

This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably. ---  --- The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine. ---  --- This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green). ---  --- This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it	pos

On the advice of my chiropractor, I decided to buy an inversion table, but didn't want to spend a lot of money because I feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room, along with my rowing machine and exercise bike.  So I purchased this Calm system because it was inexpensive and I figured I could sell it or send it back if I ended up not using it. ---  --- Well, so far I and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain, and best of all you don't have to spend a lot of time on the machine.  About 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine. ---  --- Also, the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit.  Overall, I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system.  There is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy	pos

I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features. ---  --- Pros: --- -very comfy seat, good padding  --- -the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely --- - the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat --- - the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing --- - the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze. --- - The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it. --- - the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position --- - this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo --- - The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my Evenflo ---  ---  --- Cons: --- I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend). --- - The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing. --- - As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse. --- - The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems --- -This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower! ---  --- Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it	pos

I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the Playstation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun, and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails. What they didn't say was that it's almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller, which is what you really need to do. For anything but shooting, all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour's play time, I had to take a break to rest my aching joints. ---  --- In case you haven't seen it, the G-Con2 gun has a teeny-weeny directional pad on the back of it, and it's this that you are expected to use to move yourself around. Now, if you try holding the gun in a standard "aiming" style, you'll soon realise that your fingers are in nowhere near the right position to be able to reach it. You could just hold the gun wrongly and reach it, but you need to be able to fire at the screen regularly to kill dinosaurs. And they don't sit still waiting to be shot! So for most of the game you need to be able to move and fire at the same time. And guess what? It's impossible. Bravo, Capcom. Oh, sorry, they didn't stop there, but added a further control scheme to allow you to strafe. To do this you need still more fingers so that you can still press the directional pad, along with two further buttons way down on the gun barrel at the same time. And be able to pull the trigger. But even that's the end of it - if you want still more pain, try using sniper mode!  ---  --- As you may have realised, the control scheme completely spoiled the gameplay for me. I'm not fumble-handed by any means, but you would need to be an octopus to manage all this. Which is a shame, because a free-roaming game about shooting dinosaurs is a very exciting idea. And Dino Stalker is otherwise presented very well. The graphics are very good and the monsters all look very impressive. Some stages are really good fun but my favourite ones are those when you are riding some kind of vehicle, which means you don't have to worry about movement at all - hooray! The levels where you get chased down a tunnel by an enraged T-Rex are probably the most fun in the game. The rest is ruined by the controls, which make your life hell. I'll tell you something else too - most levels have a TIME LIMIT!! In case you thought a slow careful hunt would save your fingers, this has been rendered an impossibility by the levels having a clock that counts down to zero - so if you don't rush through the stage, it's game over for you. Kind of negates the joy of free-roaming, doesn't it? You are basically stuck with dashing from point A to point B, killing everything that moves...might as well be on rails. I don't know why this stupid condition was added, as Dino Stalker was not created to be an arcade game. ---  --- It's a real waste of potential, but it's only fitting that Dino Stalker was a miserable failure after release. If you buy it, you have only yourself to blame. I managed to finish it - the final stage in the volcanic pit was actually pretty good fun, but this and the other bosses towards the end were endurance tests that caused me agonising hand cramps to get through. Save yourself - I made it through so that I could come here and tell you that you don't have to. Could have been a great game, but it all went wrong due to the impossible way you are expected to be able to use the gun.	neg

Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updates  --- every time I open the program.   ---  --- Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.  And it's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me. ---  --- Using it with Quicken is a PITA. ---  --- It is unclear to me how you get more than one state	pos
I've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts, a turkey and a pork roast, were quite good!  I anticipate excellent results as I gain experience.  One caveat, it doesn't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10-15 lb roasts.  The instruction booklet doesn't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes, but there's lots of both on the internet.  I suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w/a gas grill, but I've been using charcoal for many, many years...and that's that	pos
I loved this camera when I got it. --- But after three months the lens would not close.  It makes grinding noises, --- the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again.   --- I am very disappointed in this camera	neg
No collection of blues/rock is complete without "A Piece of Your Soul".  There very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc.  From the raunchy ("Bitter Rain") to the uplifting ("Good Day For The Blues") to the bittersweet ("Cynical") to the soft ("Share That Smile") Storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique.  Put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island	pos
Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever..	neg
These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.	neg
This is a beautiful piece of B-B-Q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone, but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and I'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times!  Looking back at the original information, it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects. I wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect. I will let you know what happens. Too bad about the brush. It looked so good with my stainless steel weber...	neg
It's good to see that in his twilight years, old squinty eyes, Clint Eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes, because, well, he is a grouchy old dude. This movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact, Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1. So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent "Unforgiven"	neg

This sonic pest repeller works a lot better than others.  It will keep away a lot of rodents and decrease the number of spiders drastically.

Just look how many are for sale, thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is. It has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting. I fastforwarded about 70% of the movie! and what got me was on the back it says "Family-Friendly" im still laughing about that! What has this world come to? I would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone! Even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person doesn't buy or rent this movie. Im embarassed that I rented it! Please turn away now	neg
I use this purely as shower gel/cleanser and absolutely love it.  The smell is great - not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning.  It reminds me of the lemonade stands I used to have as a kid.  Easily one of my favorite Philosophy fragrances.  I also recommend "Falling in Love," and "Strawberry Daquiri."  In fact, I don't think you could go wrong with any Philosophy products! 	pos
like many new parents, I had lots of plans including my newborn sleeping by himself in a charming bassinet and later a crib... WELL... upon his arrival, my son showed us that he slept better between my husband and I for the first 6 weeks, plus he helped my husband and I sleep better not having to get up at every new and strange sound he made (for a new parent all the sounds are scary).  we just lifted our heads and knew he was fine, and went back to sleep.  Yes, it was a bit tight in a queen size bed, but most importantly, he was safe and we did not have to get up.  We used in bed until 6 weeks old, and then used it to transition him to his crib for the next 2 weeks.  overall, well worth it, plus easy to transport if need to spend the night at someone elses house during the first 2-3 months	pos
This is one of the best sources for ideas on home improvement.  Beyond the great ideas, they also give you detailed directions on projects along with a good number of pictures.  I have learned how to do a great number of things I used to hire others to do because I thought I didn't have the skills - they make most projects around the house seem accessible, but not by oversimplifying the process.  Some may argue that they give too much detail, but this is essential for anyone new to a project and can be breezed through for those that are more experienced. ---  --- The only downside is that they give you ideas for things you never knew you needed! 	pos
Good quality, well built vest of full bodied fleece.  Vest is slightly fitted at the waist for a feminine look and the arm holes are neatly close fitting to keep the warmth in.  Sizes run alittle large.  I love my extra small vest and my daughter loves her small vest	pos
I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. The only problem I had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. I tried really hard to get it in, but it just wouldn't budge. Luckily, I could get the screw in on the other end, so it is relatively secure.  --- The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now I don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar, or because that's just the way it is. but I don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything. --- Over all, this is a really nice bike. The price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it. I don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. Most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance, what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor.  --- It is really quiet - I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but it's not that big of a deal considering the price	pos
So this controller looked pretty sweet to me so I bought it over a rumble pad. I liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat, as I tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers. I bought this controller specifically for Star Wars Battlefront 2 on PC, and it works like a dream. I also like the X-Box controller layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the PS2 style controller that is the Logitech Rumble pad. It also has better grips than a PS2 controller. ---  --- The only things I think are bad about it are the following: --- 1. It is not modeled on the large XBox controller, but rather the regular one, which is ok for most people, but I have big hands and I get a bit cramped up if I play for way too long. --- 2. I was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. I have a Saitek Cyborg EVO joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. This isn't an issue with Battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator, but I could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard. --- 3. This isn't so much an issue for me, but I would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan, that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. I don't care too much, because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. I will still use it even if it does die. ---  --- Overall, a great controller, I actually would give it a 4.5 rating, but that isn't an option here	pos

PNY memory is not very specific on its products, check and re-check that the specs. are what you need.

This is amazing I tell ya, Seriously I've doubted it since my first child, and then my twins ( never got it ) with them, just assumed it was some Hype. Well with my last baby, and finally a girl, I caved. Its hard to hold a baby all day long when you hve 3 other children and a home to keep in order ( or try ) ---  --- anyway her screams were out of no where, she wasn't happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you. and sometimes that wasn't good enough.  she cried and cried and waled. it really drove us all bonkers. she isn't a pacifyer baby either, so we were at loss. ---  ---  --- she was obviously really gassy, she got hiccups ALOT. She's breastfed and we couldn't figure out what it was, that maybe I was eating?  ---  --- Sure enough today we tried it, and she's peacefully sleeping without stirring. I recomend it 110%. My husband got it at his work with a 20% discount, I'm so relieved	pos
I've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned.  I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week.  The length adjuster on the side of the clippers doesn't hold.  If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down.  Tightening the screw didn't help either.  The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.  This attachment can only be used if you don't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull.  The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck	neg
We received this toy as a gift when our son was born.  It was installed on our crib once and was removed once to replace the batteries.  When I went to put it back onto the crib, I noticed that the plastic straps that affix it to the crib were cracked and starting to break.  I need to stress that this toy was only affixed to the crib one time and my son never pulled on it or put stress on the straps at all.  Also, like other reviewers have stated, the company recommends removing it from the crib at 5 months of age - yet that's when my son started interacting with it, so it's a little age-inappropriate. ---  --- I contacted the company about the straps to see if there is an at-home repair kit or if they offer a replacement...I'll repost if I hear from them. --- 	neg

True -- as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware, which I have not, so I cannot comment on how well that works. As a tension or pressure-mounted gate, I love this item. I have no problems stepping over it -- and I'm only 5' 5"-- so I never found it to be a nuisance. It's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily. It's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings, although that takes two hands. It's light enough that I can carry my 13-month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as I travel from floor to floor.  ---  --- My 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs. Again, we love the fact that we don't have to damage the molding on the doorframes. ---  --- My husband and I are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one	pos
I am quite fond of this character.  Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but you have to understand where he's coming from.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity.  Then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and, as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation.  Fusing his mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry.  This highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book.  He may not make a great center piece, but the figure is good looking, none-the-less	pos
This game came highly recommended by people who generally have similar taste in games as me, but I'm still trying to figure out why.  --- There's no question that the in-game graphics are impressive and the story-line is interesting. However the gameplay is nearly non-existant, and when you do happen to participate in some of the action the controls are either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated (i.e. the sphere grid or blitzball). Even the story is often poorly told, with stilted voices and hilariously bad character animation. --- If I had to compare this game to some of Squaresoft's other efforts, it is similar to a mix between Final Fantasy 8 and Chrono Cross. But while those two games were generally frowned upon by RPG enthusiasts, Final Fantsy X has recieved almost universal praise. In short, I'm not so much disappointed with the game as I am baffled by its warm reception.	neg
I had originally heard "Drive Away" on a radio station and I was instantly blown away.  Upon seeing the music video for it, I decided to buy the CD.  I was hardly disappointed.  The emotion that goes into the CD is amazing and it's definitly a CD to sit down and enjoy.  I saw the band in concert and met Jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was. Give Gratitude a chance and you won't be disappointed.	pos
I would recommend this game to any and everyone completely.  I would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player.  Ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it's sooo much fun.  Most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few. ---  --- I would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products.   ---  --- Never got tired of the game and like I said I recommend it to everyone. ---  --- Thanks, ---  --- B.

Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock. ---  --- It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like. ---  --- The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm. ---  --- Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand. ---  --- Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen... ---  --- Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages. ---  --- Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back. ---  --- Track 5 - Ugh. ---  --- Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council... ---  --- Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial. ---  --- Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5? ---  --- Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up. ---  --- Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright. ---  --- Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands. ---  --- Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel. ---  --- Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad. ---  --- Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne... ---  --- Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key. ---  --- Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now. ---  --- Flame away, kiddies.	neg

Our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out.  Then we found this one & got it for her for Christmas and she *loves* it.  After 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with NO training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so.  It is all due to this bike.  I never would have believed it since she was *petrified* of riding a bike WITH training wheels before.  And when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels, there were lots of tears & they screamed for their training wheels back!   And their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn't even have to help her. ---  --- Now we are loaning out the Scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too!  In fact I just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals & I'm pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too, the way that he speeds around on the Scoot!  It was well worth the purchase	pos
I've had this cd since it came out and it continues to be my favorite.  It's a cd that I can put in anytime and thoroughly enjoy.

Well you know the drill. Some people will like anything that is "artsy" or "out of the ordinary" or "made by that great director". Its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless. ---  --- The movie is about incest. It is about sex and adolescence. And, ironically, it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews. The best part of this movie is Eva Green. Or, more precisely, Eva Green's body. I didn't care about her acting (I thought it was mediocre). I just sat there and drunk her body in, wishing that I was that lucky actor (whats his name again?). The only reason to watch this movie is Eva Green. If she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation, then I am glad it happened. The movie is visually rich. In fact, its so rich that Bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see. But I will take it. He captures and celebrates Eve Green's stunning body - every square millimeter of it(including her genitals - the movie is NC17 for a reason), to perfection. Other than that, there is nothing else in the movie. The story is utterly insipid, the old movie clips, the "discussion" of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting. The music is another plus point. ---  --- Bottomline, watch it for Eva Green's body. It deserves five stars. But the movie deserves only two	neg

We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES It! It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride. Brakes work very well. Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius.

This film came out in 1973 and I saw it in its original full length version (about 3hours and 15 min.) Executives from Columbia Pictures were there, it was the premeire, and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out(verbal) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums. The executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across Columbus Circle in Boston and I and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free. We returned to the film and I have always loved this crazy redition of Lost Horizon, the miscasting, the terrible sets, the odd ball music for the story, the dubbed Liv Ullmann, the dance routines of Olivia Hussey..all of it. You cannot find a musical like it, or a soundtrack like it. Columbia execs were unimaginative; they should have believed in this film. The next day after this premeire in Boston, New York etc. (simultaneous I suppose) the film was cut, the posters were taken down..there was a ton of material to buy..T Shirts, dolls, posters of all sizes, bath towels with the poster on them, records of the sd tk of course, and small pop up sets of the entire film. It was to be a massive hit..In two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed, and the posters said, Last Two Weeks, and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared. --- But many people came to see it..lines of people, and, when they heard it had been cut, they gave up, and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film.  --- I have many treasures from that opening nite, and now I have the CD of the sound track. Anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film; it is unique. ---  --- Enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a DVD ..they are out there	pos
Even though Gary Allen is a country singer, he rocks as an artist!  He has a vein of rock mixed in with his deep country voice.

This DVD contains three episodes of "Bear in the Big Blue House." The first two have a birthday party theme. The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it is still rocking. ---  --- The fun starts with "Mouse Party" when our friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to "Happy, Happy Birthday" when the time comes for Tutter's big party. ---  --- Next comes "Bear's Birthday Bash." This is an episode that recalls "Mouse Party" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise party. ---  --- Finally, "Dancin' the Day Away" finds everyone in the Big Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really can. ---  ---  --- This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs	pos
There can't be a better storyteller than Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one. So many cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way, kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age. And what a great price! Well worth it!	pos
At least if your going to decieve people about the LCD screen in the back, AT LEAST make the picture quality decent.  I mean this barely qualifies as a picture.

Rings-Ding's are the best snacks out there for many a reasons. First off, they are the best after dinner snacks out there. It's really like a cake, just more condensed and not as fatty or filling. Also, these things are addicting. In my life, I cannot even count how much packs I have consumed, since I have been eating these things everyday since I was young, and let's just say now I am very old. If you cannot afford drugs, then go for the ring-ding's. The only negative about these things if there isn't enough cream, then you get a mouthful of chocolate. Most people I know like the chocolate, but I personally would not like a mouthful of it. Another bad thing is in the summer, they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated. They kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer, which makes this the perfect snack for the winter. ---  --- Alright...the anatomy of a ring-ding (DUN-DUN-DUN). First off, you get a chocolatey outside that is pretty soft. In the center is a creamy sensation (sorry if that sounded dirty...get your mind out of the gutter) that really makes this product go from good to great. Put that together and you get probably the best snack out there right now. They come two in a pack and are made by Drake's. Usually, Drake's is in the shadow of Hostess, yet I feel Drake's destroys Hostess in terms of their cakes. If you are actually reading this, please don't destroy me for saying that Ring-Ding's totally annihilates anything Hostess has ever put out. Wow...I managed to make a food product two paragraphs long (two short paragraphs I should say). I would put the whole history of the Ring-Ding in, but that would probably be taking someone else's work. I guess I'll stop now. Anyway, Ring-Ding's for the win!!	pos

Try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums.  Let me give you one ground rule though:  It has to be from a band that put out at least five albums (so no Stone Roses, Sugar, Verve or Jane's Addiction, e.g.).  Here are some of mine, off the top of my head: Led Zeppelin I, In the Court of the Crimson King, Days of Future Passed, The Doors, Boy (U2), C.S.N., Can't Buy a Thrill (Steely Dan), Ten (Pearl Jam), Murmur (REM).  I'm sure there are a number of others that I'm forgetting.  Oh yeah, one more: the incredible "Ferment," by Catherine Wheel. ---  --- The harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by Rob Dickinson and Brian Futter, the compelling rhythms generated by Dave Hawes (Bass) and Neil Sims (Percussion), it just all works, and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary "Nowhere" by Ride (not quite as great as "Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine).  Unfortunately, C.W. never quite matched the power of "Ferment" with their subsequent releases. ---  --- The best song on the album is "Black Metallic" ("it's the color of her skin/ her skin is black metallic") which soars up to the sky, floats in the wind, lands, and soars again.  Clearly, "Black Metallic" clocks in as the band's "Stairway to Heaven."  The second best song on "Ferment" is . . . well that's where it gets tricky, and demostrates how great this album is.  There are no weak or even average songs, and I could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to "Black Metallic."  Put a gun to my head and I would have to go with "Shallow" or maybe "Tumbledown" or perhaps, if I'm in a more pop oriented mood, the danceable "I Want to Touch You."  Although, last night, as I was listening to the album in preparation for this review, I thought of how strongly it closes with the trio ""Bill and Ben," "Salt" and the uplifting "Balloon" ("ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon"). ---  --- A wonderful album.  Perhaps not in my top ten, but definitely in my top twenty (tied with the aforementioned "Nowhere")	pos

Gilad takes you through it with plenty of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly, and position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work.

I've had several gens of the candybar blackberries, 7100 nice but reception/mike was horrendous, 7130 much better, finally nailed it. Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky.... but I'll give it the full thumbs up now. Slightly smaller than 7130, which oddly does make a difference, like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something. Makes my partner's Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison. Unobtrustive in yr pocket. The "pearl" trackball is just fine, like it better than roller actually. Reception, mike quality are also good, despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130. Writing is good too, the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check. And hey, I like having the camera. So, I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone, the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great.... but actually... I like the Pearl better. If you need bulletproof email, PDA, and phone, this is yr baby. Slightly shorter battery life, but hasn't stranded me yet.	pos

When my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him.  It was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings.

I have received many compliments on the Sterling Silver Byzantine Bracelet, 7.5".  It is a nice size (~1/4" diameter).  It is a beautiful link.  It is a really nice peice:  perfect for both casual and formal wear.  The only things I did not like are that the bracelet is not totally cylindrical (it is flat on one side) and some of the links are welded together (not that this really matters because no one can see this).  However, compared to the byzantine bracelet I had had in the past, it is fantastic.  That one kept breaking apart any time it got caught on anything because the rings were not welded closed.

I've had a couple of casio watches in the past, pathfinders to gshocks. This watch is not too big, though it has a pretty thick face, the material looks and feels pretty sturdy. ---  --- Setting of the watch is not too difficult, it's similar to other casio watches. I did not have problems getting the hands to match the digital time, it appeared to do it automatially, although i believe you have a feature to intentionally set them out of sync. Radio atomic reception is great, (Austin, Tx). The light is based of two led's on the left and right of the watch face.

I have multiple concerns with this product. Out of the box, they really do look fresh and plump like they do in the picture.  ---  --- However, you soon notice the lack of instructions. None. The only documentation at all is a "California" sticker... with no reference to a web site. Nada. ---  --- My grapes broke quickly. When I received them they looked just like the picture. But in a couple days I started noticing they weren't as plump and were shriveling. Withing a week, many were brown and certainly lacked freshness. It was so bad, that I was in shock, and I kept holding up the picture next to them to compare because I couldn't believe it. It was like they were deteriorating right before my eyes. ---  --- Within a month they looked awful. They looked like moldy raisins. Really Moldy. ---  --- Not recommended	neg
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it. --- From the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd, considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit.  I bet it took them all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this movie. --- Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as Outworld.  This merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity. --- With only a week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar, replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this from happening. --- The story in and of itself is not necessarily bad.  However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high, only to have practically everything come crashing down. --- The only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein, Juno Reactor, and others. --- If ever you're looking to punish yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later.	neg

There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal. ---  --- In perfect contrast to Emma, Flaubert introduces Charles Bovary, a proto-typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer. Soon after their wedding, Emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling Charles and yearns for a romantic interlude. Flaubert represents the absolute clichï¿½ of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man. Flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, Leon. With a slow-blossoming relationship with Emma, Leon leaves for Paris to study law. Upon his return--and with a little experience--the two become lovers. Flaubert's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore. Thereafter, the degeneracy of Emma's lifestyle is evident, and she is brought to the brink of destruction. ---  --- In Madame Bovary, Gustave Flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people living in France during the mid-nineteenth-century. Flaubert's descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing. Opening with first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has earned Gustave Flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century	pos

I was in the Travel Industry for years, and found CN to be an excellent, albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations, and all other aspects of travel, whether upscale or backpack. Yes, it is not encyclopaedic, and yes it is chock full of adverts.

Their travel product ratings are next to none, and shortlists the selection process, allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions	pos

This movie certainly had some strong actors and actresses in it and that with an interesting storyline landed it on my viewing list. ---  --- Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  I figured there would be a little more real suspense or "thrill" but it never materialized and instead just followed many of the usual plot events.  The biggest failure was the completely unneccessary cheesey romance between Eastwood and Russo. It was contrived, lame, and almost laughable. I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasnt having a nightmare! ---  --- John Malkovich does a great job as the wackjob and is totally convincing in this role.  Unfortunately the script didnt do him enough justice and even his character did some staple moves.  Clint Eastwood was great as always but he did play his usual self. No problem here though, Clint was solid. ---  --- The film just fizzled as it went along and it started to get tiresome towards the very end.  The climax was rather anti-climactic except for the shooting scene which was kind of cool although I saw it coming a mile away.  There was not as much suspense as I was hoping for and the "thrill" was mostly missing. ---  --- What else can I say, watch it and make your own decision but overall I was not that impressed and the film let me down a bit after such glowing reviews	neg

I will start this review by noting two things. I greatly appreciated Nussbaum's 'Upheavals of Thought', and I am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society I live in. (But, then, I recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society I am embedded in.) But Wedekind's play 'Springtime Awakening' should raise alarm bells for most of us.  ---  --- We are sexual beings (most of us anyway) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it within ourselves, learn to share it with others (it is, of course, the quintessential sharing experience), learn to grow with it, learn to let it go .... The easy path to take is to grasp a social 'norm' and follow it regardless of the morality of that path. Societies do present many 'norms' to a young person developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally desirable. If Nussbaum's book does nothing else but diminish the acceptability of some of the undesirable 'norms', and enhance the more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great service.  ---  --- There are curious things in this book for me. Nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male - Aristotle, Seneca, JS Mill, DH Lawrence .... To be fair, the last chapter is about 'To the Lighthouse' by Virginia Woolf, and other writers such as Andrea Dworkin are prominent. However I was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is Mary Wolstonecraft, where is Emma Goldman, where is Mary Shelley? Why is 'Maurice' (Forster) referred to but not 'The Well of Loneliness' (Hall)?  ---  --- The chapter on female genital mutilation (FGM) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies. Nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision; not surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted (so I read) to Judaism. While I would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk, nevertheless I think the motivations for both practices come from the same source. If, for cultural (religious) reasons it is appropriate for Jewish boys to be circumcised, I think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate, if not mandatory.  ---  --- The chapter on Equity and Mercy impressed me immensely - it is so balanced I expect many feminists will hate it. But for me, her rare use of a Christian quote ('Forgive them, for they know not what they do.') was a revelation. Never before had I seen how compromised that plea is. (Compare with Tolstoy: 'It is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself, but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself.')  ---  --- The fact that often I have other feelings than Nussbaum expresses does not concern me, because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts. In the chapter on prostitution and its illegality I had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality. The morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex. Just as there are men with 'dangerous' sexuality, so there are women. Perhaps it's only an issue for men because they demand or expect control. For me, all of Nussbaum's discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not inappopriate even though it may not be balanced. The problem I see with prostitution is that it panders to the man's 'need' to have sex. They can get it on demand. This reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives, including the need (wise or not) for a woman to have a faithful partner. In Australia we had an advisor on women's affairs to the Federal Government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting, so he could satisfy his 'need' when she herself felt incapable. For me this is an appalling suggestion - as if men cannot have self-control and should not be expected to. But, for all of that, like Nussbaum I would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal. ---  --- For me this was a thought-provoking read. It had some incredibly ugly things to describe, to consider. But it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity.  ---  --- Other recommendations:  --- 'Springtime Awakening' - Wedekind  --- 'The Well of Loneliness' - Radclyffe Hall (I hated the outcome of this)  --- 'Matilda' - Mary Shelley (her biographical details are worth exploring too)  --- 'Godwin on Wollstonecraft' - William Godwin (Mary Shelley's father; Mary Wollstonecraft was her mother)  --- 'Upheavals to Thought' - Nussbaum  --- 'Living my Life' - Emma Goldman  --- 'Let Me Alone' - Anna Kavan  --- 'Conditions of Love' - John Armstrong	pos

     My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model.  ---      ---      ---      ---       ---       ---    	neg

One star is the lowest rating I can give this system and it's frankly not worth even that. Problems start with the design. You have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking "solar powered" sender unit, which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. Once you've mounted the unit on your roof, you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof, in the freezing wind usually, several times a winter. Or wait for Spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work.  --- Sometimes resetting the base station works (which you have to place inconveniently so that the unit has direct line of sight communication. Usually not. OS Sales has it advertised at 300 feet, but actually something less than forty if your batteries are more than a day old (see battery change procedure above). By the way, there is a backup nicad battery in the unit, supposedly kept charged by the impressive solar power collector. This will fail because it rapidly loses capacity due to a poor discharge recharge cycle. If any of these three fail, the unit won't function.  --- Strangely enough, my rain gauge (I live in the desert) has continued to function for over a year with little attention. However, the temp/humidity sensor which I would like to refer to most often, is what fails every night. I'd like to replace the Nicad battery, but can't find one anywhere.  --- Ahem. Customer Service and the lack of it. I don't know how many emails I've sent. Or calls I've placed. Or time I've spent listening to the backside of the Oregon Scientific hold button. Their website only lists complete systems in the replacement parts category. While assumptions can be dangerous, my only option seems to be to scrap $300 worth of two-year old hardware and buy more, and more, and more.  --- This was a well-intended gift. I'm trying to make it work. but it doesn't, usually when I need it most.	neg

I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function.  My son's Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not. Review is based on 1 week of usage. ---  --- I've also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later. ---  --- Strengths:  --- *Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3 --- *Excellent voice quality with headsets (wired or bluetooth) --- *Text, SMS, MMS --- *shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features --- *Battery life is outstanding --- *mp3 player --- *RSS reader --- *Bluetooth synchronization of files --- *Ability to set up phone in non-english languages --- *Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees --- *Sync cord charges the battery --- *Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable (if you don't have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big $$$) --- *FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area --- *standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane --- *Edge technology - my p10i did not have this.  I can download email extremely quickly now!!! --- *step counter & calories expended ---  --- Neutral:  --- *The international charger with an adapter for US outlets.  It is very wobbly in the outlet.  I'll invest in a US version. --- *Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista (I'm sure a workaround is coming) --- *I haven't used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounter's accuracy. --- *Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna, I haven't had a problem with this. --- *Over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out! ---  --- Weaknesses:  --- *Since I have other Sony phones, I am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger.  Translation, you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones.  --- *There is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset. You either listen to the radio or charge the phone. --- * You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets because there is no outlet for it. --- *Need to switch settings to view more than one email account --- *Yet another memory card format (micro)another adapter needed --- *Memory card only 512mb (can purchase 1 or 2gb) --- *picture caller id only works after you open the phone (edit March 21,2007 - if you have answer on open set) ---  ---  --- I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $254.00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days. I'm unsure if I can provide their name here. ---  --- Overall: Sony has always produced quality products. I love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone. I do miss using my styllus.  If you don't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone, go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender. ---  ---  --- If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would even though I haven't tried all of the features of this phone.  Buy it without hesitation! ---  --- ADDENDUM March 5, 2007 ---  --- I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor.  When it hit, the clip, battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor.  Amazingly, the phone still operates.  The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone.  A mark like that could happen in my purse! ---  --- I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again! ---  --- 	pos
I was so upset after I finished reading this book.  I wish it wasn't updated and they just kept it in its original version.  If you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values, this is the wrong book.  Read Bushido: The Soul of Japan.  The Code of The Samurai really felt like The Code of the Japanese Business Man	neg
This was a perfect fit for my 13" Macbook. Tried a couple cheaper ones, but was never satisfied, usually they were just a bad fit.

I have 20 mo. old twin boys. I was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the Disney McQueen trike so I had to purchace another one. This trike has two different sitting positions, has a wide wheel base for stability, and sits lower to the ground. My boys still can't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy - It's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early!	pos
I read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially. But, when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network, there really weren't any issues. Just following the directions (and avoiding the EasySecure option) worked fine.

This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright.  ---  --- A few things I didn't like. The pilot light for "ON" is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. I had to put black electrical tape over it. The AUX input is a mini-jack instead of RCA connector. Minor inconvenience here. And finally, the cabinet is nice wood, but the finish is not as good as I think it could be.  ---  --- This radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than I expected for this price. It's a keeper	pos

I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive.  Well, I learned my lessen- you get what you pay for.  Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw, if you will, closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in.  I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it, it still stunk!  I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie.  I hope this will work out much better	neg
This is one of the silliest books I have read for a long time. It could be categorised as belonging  to the same genre of "action fantasy" as a number of Hollywood films. ---  --- Examples of the rules of reality being abandoned: ---  --- The action takes place in the middle of Antarctic winter, and the author even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside, yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other. ---  --- People spend minutes in freezing water, yet pop out none the worse for the wear. ---  --- Two close allies of the United States attack a US installation on no better motivation than a claim that a "spaceship" has been found there, shouted once through the radio. ---  --- A 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically, nor, apparently, mentally. ---  --- A prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years, but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it. ---  --- The stupidity goes on and on, but that's perhaps enough to give a taste. There are perhaps people who do not care about any of this, but I don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism	neg

I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy.

Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price	pos
This CD is great.  It is a must have.  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly.  You hear the rain, the thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer.  The storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover.  The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents.  The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive now.  This cd is all in one, the real deal.  It is not all thunder.  I love it.  I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a waste of money.  To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out, static and more static. 	pos

L'Occitane's Lavender Harvest Matte Face Lotion *really works* to mattify oil and makes a nice makeup primer.  ---  --- I don't have oily skin, but tried some samples over a night serum I was using with avocado oil to mattify it, so my face wouldn't be greasy on my pillow.  It left my skin feeling satiny and smooth.  Avocado is one of the heavier, thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin, but I hated the feel of it, so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem.   ---  --- Lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties, is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes, and mosquitoes don't like it, so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer, you should try this!  ---  --- Note: I have had good luck shopping with L'Occitane through Amazon, but called first to make sure what I was ordering was in stock on their website.  	pos

Although this game maybe aimed for kids, it can still offer powerful training games in an entertaining way. Each assorted machines is like an arcade that trains each tactical aspects individually. Such as blind Chess, eye-training, memory training of chess positions are most notable that separates it from the other beginner chess training programs.  ---  --- The only thing I hate bout this game is the lack of options. You can't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames. No BGMs (backgroundmusic)during chess matches.  ---  --- Other than that, its an awesome tactical training tool. Kids really do love to play this game and is one of the best games out there that can get them into playing Chess. I think Chess can be a beneficial contribution to school learning and thinking process.	pos

This is my favorite cereal, I recommend it to everyone I can.  I eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time.  Best of all, it tastes great.

This ink is the same as Pelikan 4001 Brilliant Black. The cartridge shapes for A. T. Cross and Pelikan fountain pens are different, so pay attention if you're ordering cartridges. Pelikan 4001 ink bottles come in two sizes, while A. T. Cross ink bottles come only in the larger size. This ink is a true black (unlike some black fountain pen inks), and it is very smooth to write with, too. It is not very water-resistant, and it is not safe for writing checks	pos
I got this game for my then nearly 4-year-old daughter and a year later she still enjoys playing it.  The game is VERY simple and does not require reading. All the parts and pieces are high quality. It's a good opportunity to work with numbers and measuring, plus the game goes fast so you can play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you have the time/inclination. ---  --- The object is to create the tallest character by mixing/matching 5 parts (feet, legs, body, head, and hat).  The character pieces are brightly colored and fun and include: ballerina, doctor, fireman/woman, policeman/woman, cowboy/cowgirl, and a clown.  A roll of the die determines which part you select.  The die has both pictures and words--except for the WILD side which is printed in red.  ---  --- After the characters are assembled each player measures with the included ruler (you can choose centimeters or inches) to see whose character is the tallest. It's a sliding ruler with a base so the kids can actually fit their character inside and line up the top with the corresponding number on the ruler. ---  --- I wouldn't recommend this game for kids beyond 5--it may be a little too simple.  But for 3/4/5's it's a great game	pos

First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead.  It is all plastic!  I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs.  I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal.  Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it.  We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall.  We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something.  I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon	neg
I loved this smoker the first two times I used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it didn't work at all.

I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill	neg
(Review written by my wife, the user.) --- I've happily used the Quicken Checkbook program for many years.  When we changed operating systems from Windows XP to Windows Vista, I was unable to get the Quicken 2002 version to work in Vista, so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program.  The only feature I use is the Checkbook program and as far as I'm concerned, it's perfect.  I've never used the download from bank option because I prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives. I use Edit Preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and I couldn't be happier.  The price is reasonable, too	pos

I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something. --- Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm	neg
If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged.	pos

Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.

My husband and I had been talking about getting a detector on and off for over a year.  The more we looked into it, the more confused we were. We didn't know what features we needed or what to look for. We didn't want to spend too much but were afraid to go too low and end up with one that didn't work well.  We decided on this one based on other reviews and price. --- It came with a video which helped us understand about the model and how they work in general. Just practicing around the yard he found two colonial coins.  We've only taken it on one camping trip and found a silver dime, some quarters, pennies, and a silver Mexican Peso in New Hampshire about 4 inches deep.  My husband is getting the hang of it.  The more items you find, the more you understand it.  He says that when it says it's junk, turns out it is junk and it's been right on with quarters and smaller coins.   --- We are very happy with the unit and feel we made the right choice.  I would have given it one more star but my husband hasn't found any jewelry yet	pos
These big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies. Do you see how this scam works??? They sell "FRESH WHOLE RABBIT" but when I order it, there's no head or skin!

I have contacted Amazon 3 times asking them to please send me the skin, feet, and head so I have the complete set and they have ignored me or sent me autoresponder emails that don't specifically address the missing head and so on. ---  --- What they do, I'm guessing, is then resell rabbit heads, rabbit feet, and bloody rabbit scalps on another part of this website, and it's all pure profit.

On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation.

This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history	neg
I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters, so take this opinion with that in mind.  The only problem with R-Type is that dying sucks.  When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups.  Once you unlock free-play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc.  However overall I think it's the best of the R-types and one of the better side scrollers out there.	pos
Rockin' Red Guitar, eh? Perhaps rockin' should ready "rocky," as the plastic case is easily broken by any youngster... or oldster, for that matter. Additionally, this "toy" comes pre-stringed with some form of non-natural strings, supposedly nylon -- two of these non-gut strings broke when attempting to ellicit some music from the item. Definitely not for a young child! It probably wouldn't last for a half-hour under constant use by smaller folk	neg
My husband and father both have this unit. It's really handy to have on road trips and to use while Geocaching. From our experience, it does take a while to download map information onto the unit, and a color screen would be nice, but for $200, I think it's a good value	pos
The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies.   Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express.  So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  The cinematography is boring and poorly done.  The plot is juvenile.  It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys.  I hated the movie.  However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made. 	neg

I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand.  It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all.  I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it.  But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage!  I do not recommend!!	neg
It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials.  I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table.  Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways).  As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand	neg
I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama.	neg

Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime.  However - it just may be one of --- those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible --- to re-capture, and in a sense, haunting.  I am not obsessive in --- any way but I have watched this movie at least twenty times - --- with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for comfort.   ---  --- The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a --- great story most definitely puts this movie in a special --- category - so buy it and watch it.  You'll be glad you did. ---  --- Mik	pos
I have tried a dozen screen guards, some of them shine a lot, some of them are not as clear as they promise, some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. This makes its way through all that problems. Well on the other hand it does have a catch --- 1. Finger print magnet --- 2. The price - THAT PRICE FOR ONE!!! --- And yea the best part is its static not gum, and its washable.	pos
This movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high.  Most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure.  There is  alittle action at the end, but of poor qualaty.  To make a long review  short, it is basically like a bad episode of G.I Jeo	neg

This three-part television production by the BBC, released in 1999, is one of the finest films you'll see in a while.  The acting is brilliant, especially the performance by Lindsay Duncan, the direction is extraordinary, and the plot is most unusual (if improbable).  The production is flawed only by a weak musical score. ---  --- The real question is: How did this superb film ever get made, in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos?  Don't miss it	pos
Quick... what's not in widescreen and has no special features?  That's right - MEGALODON!  SIXTY FEET OF PREHISTORIC TERROR - or so claims the box art.  This film may be about a shark, but the production is all about FRANKENSTEIN.  Seen JAWS?  How about THE ABYSS, ALIEN, REPTILICUS, DEEP BLUE SEA, DEEP STAR SIX or LEVIATHAN?  Then you've seen most, if not all, of MEGALODON.  It's all here - the high tech multi-billion dollar drill site, a small, but the "best at what they do" crew, the ill timed major storm (snow and ice), an ill crewman, a lost world filled with lost fish stuffed with lost Magalodons, the standard crew roundtable scar sharing scene, a spunky blond girl reporter and her husky semi-comic cameraman.  Tiny one man (one woman) subs, a helicopter crash, several "tragic" deaths all capped off with a whiz-bang explosion at the end which solves most (but not all) of the problems.  MEGALODON takes no chances by leaving nothing to the imagination.  It simply takes no risks - which is odd since it tries so hard to move in another direction all the time.  There's a good story here blocked by a very large shark.  The Magalodon doesn't come into view until halfway through the film and up until then you may find yourself wondering when they're just going to get on with it - but once the shark does arrive, does get into frame - you begin to realize that there was something more building here. ---  --- We've seen the destruction of the environment used time and again in these kinds of films - it's a backdrop.  It's something for the creator and builder of the worlds biggest and deepest oil rig to ravage and lay waste to - but here, the head of the COLOSSUS is actually a pretty good guy trying to provide the world with the fuel it needs.  When they stumble upon the lair of the Megalodon there is no talk of drilling for more oil - they all are taken by the wonder of finding a LOST WORLD.  It almost seems as if the story might breakaway here and follow a different direction.  But it never does - the shark swims in, knocks things about, knocks things over, breaks through things, and then gets blown to bits.  We skip into a THREE MONTHS LATER, get our CODA, then our STINGER that there is not one... but two, perhaps more Megalodons now loose in the world's oceans.  Nifty - but dull.   ---  --- There a TON of unanswered questions, and by the end you know the movie has cheated you (can anyone explain why the earthquakes were needed in this film?  Also, was the anchor cable drilled into the ocean floor ever going to break? - they cut back to it at least three times after each quake and I kept waiting for it to snap and the COLOSSUS to tip over - never did).  MEGALODON is what it is - full screen, ready for cable, jammed with a few nifty ideas and stuffed with off kilter CGI (the subs looks fake - but look clean, while the Megalodon itself looks and acts almost exactly like a plastic tub toy shark) effects.  Not the best, not the worst - not JAWS or any of the rest...it's MEGALODON, and it's available for sale or to rent. --- 	neg
An outstanding compilation of a wide variety of popular and regional styles from across Mexico.  This set examines both traditional and contemporary music, including a brilliant ska-banda mix by the popular "rock en espanol" band, Cafe Tacuba.  Rancheras, corridos, boleros, indie rock and various stylistic fusions are represented, and even a few sones from Veracruz -- one of my favorite musical genres!  If you are curious about the rich musical heritage of this large but often slighted nation, then check this collection out... It might open more than a few new musical doors	pos
I agree with the previous reviews that say Hydrocoach is not accurate.  Instructions say to take deliberate sucks. Even with that, not all ounces register.  It might only register 12-16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle.  I like gadgets but this $30 water bottle is not worth it.  It would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time	neg
These were on my mom's wishlist, so I bought them.  They just arrived and I'm totally disappointed.

Mario Kart Double Dash is essentially Mario Kart 64 and then some. The game brings alot of new cards to the table, which I will review below. ---  --- Mario Kart Double Dash has improved on the last game immensely, and that is saying alot, because Mario Kart 64 was one of the most fun games available for the N64. The first way it improved on the previous game was allowing players to choose 2 characters to race with instead of 1. This makes for a bit more of a complex control scheme, but otherwise doubles the fun.  ---  --- The game also features tons of available characters to play as: ---  --- Mario  --- Luigi --- Peach  --- Daisy --- Wario --- Walluigi --- Bowser  --- Baby Bowser --- Koopa  --- Paratroopa --- Baby Mario --- Baby Luigi --- Donkey Kong  --- Diddy Kong --- Yoshi, and --- Birdo ---  --- The game has the ol' Grand Prix mode and the Time Trials, but it also has some new unlockable features, such as: ---  --- New carts --- New characters --- A new circuit --- New battle mode stages... ---  --- and more, but I don't want to spoil anything.  ---  --- Mario Kart Double Dash's multiplayer modes are better than ever, too. Not only are battle and versus modes once again available, but there are new types of battles: shine theif and babomb blast.  ---  --- All in all, Mario Kart Double Dash is extremely fun and replayable, and has enough features and unlockables to keep you occupied and entertained for a while. I enjoy it, and I think any Gamecube owner should pick this game up. I reccomend renting it first to see if you like it, and then making your decision. ---  --- Thanks for reading, bubba"samus	pos
I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen	pos
my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest.

I have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years.  I am pleased with the product.  It's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast.  It's as practical as can be for what I got it for!  It also is very compact and light in the pack.  The one piece of advice I have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size.  The additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it	pos

I subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction/non-fiction books - what it turns out to be is a series of editorials, premised around virtually all non-fiction.

We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!

It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy	neg
I have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased!  Our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age.  We love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry.  Just make sure the suction cup is wet and it won't fall off the wall.  Sizewize, it's basically a perfect fit in our tub, which is slightly tapered from head to toe, but I could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub. 	pos
The pictures posted here of the Paul & Joe blotting paper compact don't do it justice. The compact is very beautiful, large and all covered in a pretty flower-patterned material. Very feminine, very stylish, very pretty. My only complaint? I wish it had a snap or something so it'd stay closed instead of only folding... ---  --- The price is a bit steep at first but fortunately, they did consider refills at an affordable price. In my experience, I haven't found different brands of blotting paper to be very different amongst themselves and this is no exception, it gets the job done adequately, only in a prettier package... ---  --- As far as blotting goes, this one blots shine like it should but get it for the stylish case and the convenience of affordable refills	pos
Why people purchase a toy for tikes when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me. Always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for. That said, all LTTO taggers, including this one, have a simple "grab and go" game called LTAG. All you have to do is pull the trigger twice and you're on your way. This is early in the manual, way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6 year olds and their parents. ---  --- I love LTTO. I even run a club that uses it here in Auburn, WA. But I *always* start new players out with LTAG, then move up to hosted games, and then to the more complicated games. Never try to start out by hosting a team Hide and Seek game, 'cus it's just too much for a young or completely new player. But that's why the LTAG game exists! Just grab it and play! No messing with the control panel. ---  --- Don't take a low rating based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much. Similarly, take my rating with a grain of salt since I'm a huge fan. But for kids 8 and up to adults, LTTO taggers are a wonderful, durable, and long lived toy that gets you moving AND thinking	pos
Understand. I have a full MS New Office Suite that I got from work.   But choose to use this product for the many items included which can't be beat.

If you have a reward ceriticate using Amazon Credit card. That $25 more off the price. So in the end it cost me $30 for it. Shop smart and use any break you could get. Right?	pos

Both movies are great, each one of them has it's own charm. --- Ashley Judd shows she is a great comedian, and Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors of his generation.

I didn't know the actors of this movie and they are amazing. Perhaps love is next door	pos

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then	neg

I absolutely loved the string music on Track 3.  I remembered it from an old PC RPG called Quest for Glory IV.  I was disappointed to find out that Track 4 was only a minute and a half long, because I grew up loving that song from the various places I heard it (Fantasia and a kid Detective PC game from the late 80's).   --- Overall, though, Grieg's greatest hits is a must-have for collectors of classical music.  Grieg is revered as Norway's greatest composer of all time and he certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines. 	pos

I didn't like the fashion sections, and I also don't like how there really aren't any articles. When I subscribe to a magazine I'd like to be able to read it, not just look at pictures. The only thing I liked about it were the success stories..and even those seemed repetitive...are we only allowed fruit and grilled chicken?	neg
I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial "best of" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase	pos

These 2 games are probably (in my opinion anyway) the best ones in the series. I will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itself. ---  --- FF5: One of the previously unreleased FF games (at the time anyway) is now in America. I really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof. I literally trained my characters (this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game) to get to level 30 or 40 (can't remember exactly) just to get my jobs mastered. the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other FF games, this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of (X-Death) rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him/her instead of the one who is destroying the world. the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters (there's only 5 in the entire game, you stick with 4, one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter) so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters. ---  --- FF6: I think this is the best one in the series. there is absolutly no real "Main" character in this game. For those who are confused, what I mean is that, well for example, FF7 you have about 9 characters but the leader character is Cloud (the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game), well in this game you can have 4 different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader. The characters are excellent in this game, I pretty much like all of them (Gau is funny, but he doesn't have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you can't even control them at all during battle). Sabin having the Blitz ability. for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move, no matter which direction your facing, you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction. for instance, one of the moves is RLR (I am talking about Right Left Right on the control pad) and if your character is facing to the right, then you have to insert that command, but if you are facing the opposite direction, it is still the same command (not the opposite combination). when I first beat the game, before beating it, I got all of the characters to level 99. This game also has some of the best music for a FF game (at the time anyway). ---  --- the collection itself: you get a music CD, the random battle screen is like FF7 and 8's random battle loading screen, FF6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies, has CGI cinemas, FF5 is pretty much like the Super NES (or should I say Super Famicom) version with just the exception of Random Battle loading screens and PSone style Opening Cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the USA and Square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features.  ---  --- overall: If you like the SNES FF games, this is the right collection for you (Along with Chronicles which includes FF4 (FF2 in the USA for the SNES) and Chrono Trigger	pos
"Spin" is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype, for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine. If Rolling Stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines, then Spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he's cool by name-dropping the Strokes.  ---  --- Spin covers some of the same turf as Rolling Stone and Blender, but less lasciviously -- lots of coverage of popular bands. Some of them are quite good -- the Hives, for example, or indie newcomer Steve Burns (who quit his job on "Blues Clues" after hearing a Flaming Lips album, and reinvented his life as a rocker).  ---  --- Unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment, and then overemphasize them again -- as well as tacking them up in whatever "coolest"/"best" lists they chalk up for the year/decade/century/history of rock. Indie cred is maintained by a few half-page articles on potentially hot bands like the Comas and Metric, but this info is halfhearted. It's like they're reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better-known bands, regardless of talent.  ---  --- The writing, however, has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have: the Need To Be Cool. Their writers always are trying to be funny, but rarely come across that way. It seems silly and strained, like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress. Even the CD reviews are mediocre. However, one recent highlight is Dave Eggers' columns -- witty, funny, and a little bit skewed. In fact, they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine. ---  --- One of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in Hollywood. Scarlett Johanssen is a wonderful actress, yes. But she doesn't sing, nor has she appeared in a music-based movie -- Jack Black yes, Scarlett no. And what is up with party coverage on TV starlet Mischa Barton and MTV couples?  ---  --- Check out sublimely indie mags like Chord, Filter, Under the Radar and the online Kludge for in-depth looks at some worthy bands. As for Spin? It's still trying to convince us it's cool, but Eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it	neg

I purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which I usually never do, usually I just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) I came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. Of course, you could acomplish this with MS Paint if you really wanted to.  --- One of the main (and only, in my opinion) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting. that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it. ---  --- One downside is that this program, because of it's many tones, uses and requires quite a bit of space. When I uploaded it on my laptop,it slowed down significantly. So much so that now I load it when I want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again!

I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one. --- The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for	neg
 you can't use this watch opener alone. You need a vise to hold the watch. The gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in. As soon as you turn it over they fall out. I've already lost two of them. It's a poorly made item, and if it woldn't cost about as much to return it as keep it I would return it	neg
America's Test Kitchen rated it number one, so I decided to try one for myself. I have owned grill brushes from Home Depot, online catalog sellers, etceteras. The bristles, regardless of material, on these brushes end up shedding over time, or if not they crush down and become nearly worthless. ---  --- The Grill Wizard eliminates these problems by using a replaceable pad. The pad works great. I'm still on my first pad and have used it probably 10 times or more already. It's a good product and I highly recommend it	pos
I bought OmniPage 15 yesterday morning as a download, and have been trying to activate it ever since. After several calls to customer service, forty minutes on hold to speak with a tech rep (who emailed me two links that don't open), I'm no closer to being able to use this program. It seemed to work okay in the few intro uses allowed before you had to activate to continue, but even then it kept wanting to reload with every page I scanned in.  ---  --- The product might be a good one--I'm not a fair judge of that--if only you can get it to work. As others have pointed out, tech support is expensive. If my experience is any measure, it's also worthless.  ---  --- Customer service is unresponsive, unpleasant, and unprofessional. In one call to Customer Service, I was asked if I typed the letters in the serial number as capitals and the O's as zeroes. When assured that I had, several times, she replied, "Then I can't help you--call the tech department," and abruptly hung up. To add irritation to insult, in the forty minutes I was on hold with the tech department, I listened to repeated assurances that a "reepersentative" would be with me shortly.   ---  --- Not recommended.	neg

I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance	neg

 I thought the DVD was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising.  It shows great technique and form.  I used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many of these pushup and workout techniques.  Pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape.   I found myself to be too advanced for the Power 10 workout  so the video seemed like common knowledge.  So for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great DVD focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent DVD .  The DVD takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup.  It then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion.  With the DVD purchase I was hoping to find an exercise program, approximately 30-45 minutes long, that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time.  I was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the Perfect Pushup into a nice timed workout.  A workout that works my chest, back, arms, abs, and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time.    Something similar to a Tae Bo style video or other timed exercise videos.  The Power 10 Workout isn't that type of video.  It is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own.  I recently wrote some emails to the Body Rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast, effective workout routine that one could get at the gym, but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their Perfect Pushup.  He seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully BodyRev builds on this DVD like they have for their other products. 	pos
Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky	neg
In this first person shooter you battle through the Star Wars battles through all episodes, fighting as soldiers on the Republic's side.  And you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier.  And, you have the opportunity to do "instant action".  That is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as.  Also, you can choose to conquer a galaxy, but it's really boring.  This game is really fun, but it starts to get boring after awhile.  So, get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen.   --- Also, Yoda is awesome	pos
i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product.  my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help.

This is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by Amicus Studios in the early 70's.  (i.e. "Tales From the Crypt", "The House That Dripped Blood", "Vault of Horror").Each anthology is held together by a certain theme.   ---  --- In "Asylum" a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient.  The young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the Asylum.  If he is correct, he gets the job.  ---  --- The stories give the feel of old horror comics, which inspired many horror anthologies. The characters are one-dimensional and driven by such deadly sins, as greed and lust. In most cases,  with a twist and a touch of macabre, the fates get their revenge on the evil-doers. ---  --- The stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre. The British countryside, where the stories are mostly set, adds an extra chill.  ---  --- The movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies, such as HBO's "Tales From the Crypt" or Stephen King's "Creepshow", and the movies noted earlier.  It would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out.  ---  --- More general audiences would be entertained, but I don't think this movie should be ranked with 5-Star horror masterpieces ("The Exorcist", "Halloween", "Psycho"), nor would I expect most general audiences to rank it so highly.    ---  --- The DVD quality is definitely noteworthy, having sharp, rich colors which enhanced the movie's experience.	pos
Just received this massager and my wife and I can't stop massaging each other with it. Especially great deal for the special Amazon price. I've been wanting one of these for years because I can hardly feel those little hand held ones (that just fit in the palm of your hand). Glad I splurged. ---  --- Only problem is that Amazon site says "7 heads", Item description says "6 heads", and actul product only included 5 heads. The one missing, from the picture on the box, is the "Acu Point" heads. I'm guessing that's why it's on sale? Still worth it if you get it on sale. Great massager.	pos
I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again	neg
We have the kind of family where we promised that all ex's and all family children, blood related or not, would be family.  People think I'm strange because my friendship with my husband's ex and her family is so important to me.  She was visiting us and our granddaughter in Ontario, CAN, she lives in L.A. and she wakens to classical music every morning.  I decided to put on Concert for George, which always brings me to tears, but she never took her eyes off of the screen.  She especially enjoyed Ravi Shankar and his daughter's opening to the concert and educated us on what the music meant.  As I told my husband...no person I have shared this DVD with has ever left it with a 'so what' opinion.  They all loved it and I think, most of my friends have it by now, Beatle lovers or not.  Thanks to all who made this a tribute to George, but also a way to educate people about his talents, his many, many friends, his loving wife and son, all of whom, obviously adored George and his music, as do I....and my close friend Mary	pos

This is an excellent book.  Its academic / sociological approach may put off some lay readers, but that would be too bad.  The subject, and the message, are both very important.  In many ways, this book is similar to "The Appearance of Impropriety:  How the Ethics Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business and Society," but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social-science standpoint.  An excellent book, well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed (at best) results	pos
I bought this Obus Forme king sized pillow because I thought it might stop my snoring.  I must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely.   ---  --- There have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first.  I found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics, but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive. ---  --- My wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it.  I have just ordered a second pillow.	pos
Admittedly, I am slightly older than the "Relevant" demographic.  But I'm not 40 yet!  So there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me.  And I applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues. ---  --- Still, the magazine suffers from it's unrelenting fawning over the whole post-modern vibe and it's own sense of self-importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness. ("Hey, look out, world!  We Jesus Freaks have iPods too!") Usually, the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance, the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant. ---  --- So, like it's spiritual cousin "Charisma," this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture.  It trumpets its ability to ask "the tough questions," even as it follows a relatively safe, politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line.   ---  --- I mean, their idea of being cutting edge was to put Bono on  the cover.  If you want to be cutting edge, put the libertine Adam Clayton on the cover and ask him about Bono's faith.  Now, I would read that article!  (I am a major U2 and Bono fan.  I'm not knocking him; just the lack of imagination at "Relevant".) ---  --- There's also way too much emulation of the world's perspective on generational heritage. "Hey, we're young, and we're smart, and we don't need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it."  I guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it in today's Paris Hilton culture, but I'd like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values.  Actually, "Relevant" seems to be a little afraid to say what "biblical values" are (beyond the obvious politically expedient ones); it all seems amorphous here. ---  --- I've never been a fan of the whole "what's hot/what's not" ethos.  And, I'd like to give a little more respect to today's Christian young people to think they could handle something that didn't fall into that same faddish trap.   ---  --- I am hopeful that they may get it right yet with "Relevant".   At times, they seem tantilizingly close.  But it takes more than a slick hairdo, male earrings, chin stubble, idolization of youth, culture icon quotations, and psycobabble "cool dude" theological lingo to make one relevant	neg

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLUE CHRONICLES? ---  --- First off, you may notice a couple of things: --- 1. This is called Clue CHRONICLES  --- 2. It is refered to as EPISODE 1 sometimes. --- 3. It is a 1999 game with no sequel --- Why is this? Well, Clue Chronicles was from Hasbro Interactive and EAI. EAI quit the gaming business and Hasbro quit computer games and was left with board games. So, the promising series was "doomed." If you enjoy this game, I advise you to write into Atari. Why Atari? Well, Hasbro was left with all their computer games. They passed all the rights to Infogrames, which became Atari. So, in the complicated and confusing Clue Chronicles Timeline, the rights are held with Atari. I will, and if you like the game you should too, write to Atari and ask for a sequel. Now, for the real review. ---  --- MY REVIEW: ---  --- Clue Chronicles follows the story of 11 unlucky party guests on a mysterious yacht owned by Ian Masque. After he drops dead, the mystery begins. Did a box kill him? So it seems...Join the old cast-Miss Scarlet, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Colonel Mustard, Professer Plum, and Mrs. White-along with a new cast of characters including-Marina Popov, Julia Kell, Sabata, Martin Urfe, and (for a short time) Ian Masque. You are a detective. Nobody has ever met this man is person, what did he want with them, and you? There is an answer. But you need to play the game to find it out. With an airtight plot that doesn't stop-even after the story ends-you will be gasping for breathe at the heartstopping cliffhanger ending! ---  --- MY GRADES: ---  --- Story 10/10-Well thought out with an unexpected ending --- Gameplay 6/10-Minor Glitches that don't effect the gameplay, but involve disappearing characters in the background --- Soundtrack-9/10-Music mostly fits the scenes --- VO 9/10-The voiceovers are great except for one small part towards the end --- Graphics 8/10-Its an old game-that about sums it up, no? ---  --- FINAL --- A- ---  --- Will always be a favorite..	pos
i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires.  and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40!  so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing.  the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device.  i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why.  it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more.  so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all	pos

One reviewer, though she raves about it, admits its flaw:  it cant be put back into its carrying form.  Indeed, it's a floppy, illconceived mess.  It basically works but there is a much better option out there: the BuggyBag.   ---  --- This "floppy" is not an easy one hand install, it doesnt TOTALLY protect the child as A) one belt feeds through to hold baby and cart allowing unnecessary contact (not ALL covers do that as one reviewer proposes) and B)because it doesnt install in one clean drop and doesnt fold into the carrying shape neatly you and baby are in contact with both floppy sides of this floppy mess as you try to flop it in and out of the cart and your car. ---  --- After trying the Floppy mess and a MISERABLE seat called the Shop'n'Dine, I've found the BuggyBag to be the perfect solution:  Truly a neat one hand install; easy zip back into its carrying shape; 2 belts (one for baby, one for cart) neat and simply storage options.  (Read my AMApedia article)   ---  --- Dont take my word for it, go to a big Baby store and try out both.  Just standing there you'll see that there's no comparison.  I'm... shocked that there are people who liked the Floppy, but SURE they never tried the BuggyBag. --- 	neg

The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar. The old 724 had metal connectors.

I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say "Insert SIM Card" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone.	neg
"House of Mirth" is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. ---  --- To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh, say, "Schindler's List," or "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" that treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm, that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think. ---  --- "House of Mirth" deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't, though, moving or thought provoking.  ---  --- I wasn't moved by Gillian Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. ---  --- Rather, I was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality.  ---  --- "House of Mirth" has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't believe anybody onscreen. ---  --- I felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any decency at all, that person is destroyed, see! ---  --- I would tend to agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch this movie? ---  --- Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart. ---  --- Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate. ---  --- The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does. ---  --- Movies like "Gone with the Wind" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch.  ---  --- One might argue that such films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs.  ---  --- And, again, watching Lily Bart in "House of Mirth" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine.	neg
I agree with the other reviews. It was a huge disappointment that it didn't heat the water.

The overall steel frame and structure of it is good, but there are too many flaws with this product, I recommend going with something else.   ---  --- Flaws:   --- 1) Bands do not give you good increments of resistence.  If you want even resistance on each side, you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting, which is crazy.   ---  --- 2) Workout and Assembly manuals are terrible.  Especially the Workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated?  What does that really say about how much Stamina cares about people using it correctly, without injury, and getting good benefit out of it?  Only about 10 exercises are really shown, the rest are just single pictures that let's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do, except that many are for some other machine, not this one. I'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use.   ---  --- 3) Many of the pictures are misleading, such that you can't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures.  One customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine.  Ridiculous.  ---  --- 4) Several construction pieces I received were bad and caused problems, but replacement parts were shipped with no problem, albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one, and then time to reconstruct the machine.  I had to replace the main Rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong.   ---  --- 5) Leg padding is inadequate and painful ---  --- 6) Doesn't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by Stamina, no one I called seems to use it or really can tell you about it. ---  --- For a company that claims to care about health and fitness, they really don't show it with this product or support for this product.  I'd go elsewhere. 	neg

I received this for Christmas from my Amazon Wishlist. I wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing. ---  --- I was a long time user of Norelco shavers, but switched to a blade since I couldn't get a close enough shave. Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can't tell for a few days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue. I typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to give a smooth, close shave. Just a hint, guys. For the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles, dimples and Adam's apple cleanly with very little drag. My only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the 'stash & sideburns while showering. Small complaint that doesn't remove any ratings stars. All in all a great shaver	pos
This is another example of a horrible waste of time and money. Our Emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair. And that brings around another problem -- Emjoi customer service and repair service. You'll want to avoid both. Better yet, avoid Emjoi and avoid the total headache. ---  --- Not only are Emjoi products cheap, they are painful to use	neg

I have been a subscriber for 15 years and still enjoy the magazine.  No, its not the best magazine for music, but it is one of the best for for general pop culture news and I still occassionally find new artists because of the magazine, though I tend to find more new movies now.  ---  --- However, if you ever have a problem with customer service, forget it.  I never got my copy of the 1,000 issue, and when I asked for a replacement, I was told they were out of that issue, but would extend my subscription by one issue.  I pointed out that it was a double issue AND that they are still selling back issues on their web site for $20.  If they don't resolve it quick, I might just cancel my subscription, I'm so disgusted. 	neg

I just received the 2007 version, and could not be happier. Like other Moleskine products, this weekly planner is of excellent quality. --- The layout is very simple, and the size is perfect for a purse. Each day in the week is allocated about 7 lines, with three days on one page, and four on the other (Sat and Sun share their space) --- I have owned notebooks of the same size (with similar leather cover), which I used daily, and have never experienced any problems with binding.  --- Overall, this is an excellent planner!	pos
I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving, so I decided to upgrade my phones.  (the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.   --- But this review is about the phone: --- Cons:  --- super short battery life, especially if you have the web. --- instead of having a separate button for each number key, it has three big keys, with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately, you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center, otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it.   --- the jury is still out on this one, but i'll list it under cons.  the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic, whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal. ---  --- pros: --- huge display --- a whole lot lighter than the 730 --- i enjoy the photo caller id.  it also shows the photo when you call that person --- the sleep mode is a good addition.  if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes, the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up. ---  --- The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front, especially since there were several colors.  This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue.  OH well.  I'll write more the more i explore the phone. 	pos

I just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one I had for years. I read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices, price being the primary concern.

I purchased my first Weill recordings in 1960, the off-broadway Threepenny Opera, and Lenya's Berlin Theater Songs. I have treasured them all my life. Lenya was, of course, incomparable, but Ute Lemper carries on her special genius. This new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece. John Mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even Klemperer missed in his masterful Kleine Dreigroschenmusik. Every member of the cast, even the bit roles, is perfect in the characterization. Kollo is the first performer since Harald Paulsen (the origninal Mackie Messer) to bring all of the tradition of Viennese operetta to this music. He is a miracle. Macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from Paulsen. Most noteworthy is the Jenny of Milva. Two delightful bonuses in the recording: a reprise in Act 2 of Seerauber Jenny by Milva (the Jenny) and the inclusion of Lucy Brown's aria after the Jealousy duet. There is brief dialog before most pieces which  adds a dramatic integrity to the recording. I cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure	pos
Listen up, I'm a big-boned gal who has yo-yoed in weight over the years. Thankfully I'm currently on a downswing, and I hope it stays that way.

USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).  Came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out.  The driver CD is useless more or less, since they don't send you a "product number," which is needed to access the menu on the CD. ---  --- It works, and I am able to send files to and from my phone, but this is after approximately two or three hours of downloading fixes and configuring my computer, and a whole lot of cursing. I won't be ordering anything from them again, and if I had it to do over, I'd order the cable from a different company	neg
In general...this program worked very well.  I've had a hard time putting my new Dual Core Pentium D computer in the RAID 1 configuration, so I bought this instead.  The clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the RAID 1 configuration, but I was a bit confused about how to use the "incremental backup" function.  The initial backup went well, but when I went back for incremental backup additions, it would tell me it was "impossible"....so I just clone the C drive every few weeks now.  I have two Seagate 320 GB SATA hard drives, and it's great to know that I have an exact copy of the c drive if I fry it.  I live in Ethiopia, so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous.  I've already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities.  I'd buy this product again, and it's comforting to know that it's on my system and that I can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when I need to	pos
This movie is funny and by being so bold in so many ways is refreshing.  It presents realistic characters without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without boring the audience.  It is a long movie but it moves at a great and effective pace. ---  --- It is full of laughs.  Joe Pesci is one of the best comic actors of all time.  I don't think that anyone else could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well.  Marisa was great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less than great.  The writing and directing, two things that often get overlooked, was wonderful.  The only weakness?  The case is a little fantastic.  It is hard to believe the coincidences in the movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime.  Of course movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches it.   ---  --- Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this movie uses it in a funny way.  I guess it wouldn't work without it... --- but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision	pos
I did a lot of research and if you follow directions , it is safe and fun. --- It takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb. turkey. The pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird. The turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering. Watch the oil temp. so it does not go over 350. Do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells.	pos

Loved our Marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward, loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat. Since this happened he's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place...just by loosening the harness.Although a highly rated seat I would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product. I have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this. --- Not very happy	neg
The short of it is that this clock performs its job quite admirably. You insert a single AA battery and then press on one of four buttons on the back to tell it whether you are Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, or Pacific Time. Wait a bit - mine received a signal about 3 minutes later, some people have to wait overnight. It receives radio signals from Colorado and it will readjust itself nightly to keep near perfect time. It will also factor in Daylight Savings Time. These it does well - and so it gets 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do. ---  --- However, if you live in the east coast, you must recognize that you are farther away from the radio source. This clock may not be able to set itself unless, for example, placed near a window. This is NOT a fault of the clock, but rather a limitation of the radio waves. ---  --- Otherwise, the clock seems well made, the wood looks real, and the numbers are easy to read from a distance	pos

I have been an afficionado of blank books since childhood, and this one is the best.  A moleskine usually lasts me about a year -- that's a year of grocery lists, ideas, business plans, sketches of where the furniture ought to be, phone numbers, recipes, all the things I might have written on scraps of paper and lost if it weren't for my moleskine.  Who needs a Blackberry? ---  --- This notebook is sturdy, with pages sewn (rather than glued), so they don't fall out.  The paper is good quality, a pleasure to write on.  There's a ribbon to keep your place, and an elastic to keep the notebook shut while it's bashing around your bag or pocket.  There's even a clever little accordion-pleated pocket in the back for receipts or ticket stubs or other small paper treasures. ---  --- Moleskines come lined and blank as well as squared, but the squared is best for my purposes -- and you'll be amazed how many uses you find for graph paper once you have it	pos
My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!) ---  --- My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn't really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long.  Most of the time, there isn't even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days. ---  --- Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience. ---  --- I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it	pos
This is another example of how Sony is alienating its customer base. Not only will it not work with standard SD memory like everyone else, it does not include a docking station.  You have to shell out more money for that option.  I dont think so	neg
Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly. 	pos
I got this as a gift for my husband.  He used it for about 3 weeks, but still had red marks, and had to follow up afterwards with a regular "disposable" razor.

We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time.

This works perfectly.	pos

My cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces. However, she can not even use the gift.

WOW! What else can I say. This is some amazing tasting marshmallow. I made fluffer nutter sandwiches for the first time in almost 10 years! I never thought I would be able to do that again! I don't know what amazed me more, the incredible taste and marshmallow made without sugar and other artificial flavors or the fact that when I called to find out if I could buy it local I was informed that it was only available direct from this company and that they would be making fresh marshmallow the next day if I wanted to order more.....you mean it doesnt spend 6 months in a warehouse and a couple of months on a supermarket shelf? WOW! This really is the best thing since sliced bread, at least in my book it is. I was also told it works well to make rice crispy treats, I'll try that with my next tub!

I have to say that I was quite impressed with this fragrance. I tend to look the other way when a product receives a little too much hype or attention. I can't say that this cologne is worth a great deal of hype, but I can say that it has a pleasant and  --- disctinctive odor. ---  --- The cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis, but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion.  ---  --- On the bad side, along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. While I am not one to prefer a "musky" cologne I could do without smelling like a woman. An additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce...  ---  --- Overall, since receiving the cologne as a gift, I am quite pleased with adding this fragrance to my collection. Good job Diddy Daddy Puff...	pos

I read The Hundred Penny Box when I was in third grade 13 years ago.  Its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever.  I have created my own Hundred Penny Box and just made one for a friend's newborn son.  My grandfather was recently diagnosed with altzheimers, an illness I assume that great-great-Aunt Dew suffered from.  I took my ratty old copy of the book to his house over Easter.  We read it together and discussed his own memories over the years.  While his memory is fading, I felt it important to hear them myself, love them, and save them in my own memory as Michael did for Aunt Dew.  I would reccomend this book to any child who is losing a grandparent and anyone who needs a good, heartwarming story	pos
It was difficult to stay "tuned-in" to this book.  A few good ideas, but nothing new or different.  It is not a book that I would recommend, however, I might try to listen again -- just to see if I missed the point.  I certainly would NOT give this book as a gift	neg
I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.  The texture was similar to a protein bar.

Man did I want to like this movie. --- Hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre. --- First we have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan Clark and Hackman "Trying to communicate" about their failing relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character "Harry" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech.  --- Don't get me wrong, this is no "MegaForce", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable. --- This is just...mediocre. Buy "Harper" with Paul Newman instead	neg

I lived in Seattle for almost 20 years.  However, in all that time, and even going down to the Pike Place Market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town), I never "knowingly" drank MarketSpice Tea.  However, we moved to North Carolina and "discovered" this wonderful drink.  We also became avid tea drinkers.  A good part of that conversion, was due to MarketSpice Tea. ---  --- The flavors are spicey, pungent, smack you up side the head intense.  If you like Lipton, you won't like this.  We use the loose tea only.  Yes, it's a little more of a hassle compared to tea bags, but worth it due to the freshness, flavor, etc. ---  --- Also, until the our last purchase, which was from Amazon, we always ordered from MarketSpice themselves.  They're great people, they always shipped what I wanted, etc.  I'll never buy from them directly again.  They don't want to move into the 21st Century when it concerns automation and I respect that.  However, I have.  Amazon gives me the capability to do both; order my favorite tea and do so online, with a company that remembers my address, credit card, etc. ---  --- I can wholeheartdly recommend this product and ordering through Amazon.  If you like tea, you owe it to yourself to try this product.	pos

This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty. ---  --- I had another A410 that did the very same thing (lens got jammed), but was stolen in a break-in before I sent it out for service (so I suppose it was no loss after all).  Obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside.     ---  --- In short, this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field. If you buy it, and plan to use it a lot, expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty (which I'm not doing) soon. 	neg

Aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine, and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout.

We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.

The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.

This is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker/storyteller.  Dark, moody, exciting (and FAST!), THX-1138 is an amazing example of style AND substance.  So whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS DVD! ---  --- Instead, spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 DVD version which delves into the making of the film, the early days of Lucas and Coppola, Walter Murch's involvement, and the whole story about American Zoetrope.  It also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor's getting their heads shaved.  All in all, it is a spectacular DVD set and worth the extra few dollars.

This is a decent magazine and it's good to support an unabashed Christian magazine.

I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love	neg

But this is exactly something I want to read and evaluate, the marketplace of business opportunities.  Many of these are franchise opportunities, which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start.  The articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful, but not all.  The value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process.  It was not until I read the E-Myth Revisited that I understood the value of these franchises.  This magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy.  The magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise.  Hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there	pos
This is perfect (so far) and exactly what I needed.  I have been looking for a new keyboard to work with my desktop, which sits right next to mu Polycom Conference Phone.  I have been looking for something that was silent and took up less desktop space.  I work out of a home office when I am not on the road so I need something that works.  I spend a lot of time on the phone, so I want to be able to type without everyone on the call knowing it.  Perfect.  Setup took about 15 minutes with absolutely no hitches and no issues - the first time that has happened for me with a LogiTech prouct.  I had read these reviews and was prepared for a grueling install, but instead it happened so quickly I was right back to work fully functional. ---  --- I use my HP Media Center as the base PC for my office and printers - the workhouse of my office, but I have a ThinkPad X60 Tablet in a docking station.  I connect from the Media Center to the ThinkPad using remote computing and it works like a champ new keyboard, mouse, keypad and all. ---  --- This is a great keyboard, mouse, and numeric keypad combination.  We will see how long the batteries last, but so far so good. A+	pos
I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)   ---  --- Down to business - the Handspring Visor Deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore.  But in its day it was.  Great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this.  Totally flawless.  People often complain about the styli of other PDAs.  No complaints here.  Not only is it relatively comfortable, it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device.  I literally lost my ORIGINAL stylus just a few days ago.   ---  --- The display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now, but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck, a good deal of the new ones don't have IR)... go for it.  And for the price I just saw it listed for on Amazon ($85) it's a total steal.  Great product	pos
I was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s. Unfortunately, instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music, what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated, with some Latin tones now and then. The only semi retro/electro tracks on here (and my favorites) are Feel For You, Love Bite, Your Love is Like a Drug, and Marc Almond's remix of Venus. The two lead singles "Move in My Direction" and "Look on the Floor" are not even the strongest tracks! And the remixes on their singles don't make them much better.  ---  --- I appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken, but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this. Take a listen to the new Madonna or even the Kelly Osbourne(!) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that don't melt down into total cheese. Unfortunately, I just don't see US radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc.  ---  --- But of course, fans of Bananarama should still add this one to their collection. It's listenable, if not up to today's standards	neg
Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here	neg
Tweezerman Browmousse is a clear gel that you brush onto your eyebrows to hold them in place. I had tried other brands of styling gels for brows and was left very disappointed - they flaked and looked all stiff and gross. ---  --- Since I am such a huge fan of the Tweezerman tweezers, I figured I would give their Browmousse a try and boy, was I ever satisfied! This gel held my brows in place all day without a single stray. No flaking! No stiff brows! ---  --- And it is so easy to apply. It comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. It stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover.  ---  --- Browmousse is a definite step up from all other brands I've tried. I will recommend this product to all my friends.	pos
Out of the box this is a simple to use camera.  The convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great. ---  --- I did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck. ---  --- Just starting to use it so can't say much for now.  My wife loved it for its size and weight	pos

After researching a few options on the market I tried Kaspersky Internet Security Suite 6.0. I needed only anti-virus but since the rebates made the whole suite cost the same as anti-virus alone I decided to give it a try. Man, I was really disappointed. Out of 7 programs only 2 started and have been working properly: anti-virus and proactive defense. The suite was trying to start other 5 programs and was requesting to reboot laptop constantly. After trying all I could I decided to call or email for help. And this is where I got my surprise - none of the contact information led me to any LIVE person. I emailed to all addresses available on the net and in the program. I called all US numbers I could - they even don't have a live representative here. If you try to call a number for US and Canada you will reach one of those accept all calls and leave your numbers with wait all you can for response time. I filled out two bug reports directly from the program with the same result. --- One of the selling points of anti-virus program was HOURLY updates. Well, guess what. You are lucky to have a DAILY update without a manual interaction. I thought that something is wrong with my work laptop and installed second program (I was naïve and bought two) on a BRAND new installation of Windows XP. Result was ABSOLUTELY identical. --- If you don't believe me - try to contact ANY of their support (not SALES) channels BEFORE you buy their product. My final view on this product would be: --- 1. Great idea --- 2. Maybe great initial implementation (the reviews were great) --- 3. And UNAVAILABLE SUPPORT.  ---  --- Don't waste your time and money	neg

My 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and Santa was kind enough to bring it for her.  The quality is fine, but it just doesn't do much.  She played with it for the first day, and has touched it maybe twice since.  I've seen these on clearance everywhere I've gone lately, too.  If your child is into playing "mommy", this is cute, but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn't really equate to lasting play value with this one	neg
Julieta Venegas did it again. She scored an album that is not alternative in style, however it is very catchy pop music. Her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on. You can sing along and express day to day feelings. Julieta continues to use instruments I like such as the harmonica. And of course, Julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances. My personal favorite is "Me voy", a very positive song about a not so positive event, breaking-up. Keep up the good work, Julieta. Your songs are appreciated.	pos

We were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a Christmas present for our four year old son.  The parking garage came with pre-drilled holes and needed to be assumbled.  Unfortunately, due to poor quality, the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional.  It would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly. 	neg

  This is a fun game. I rarely play games (last two I really played was Dungeon keeper and Final Fantasy 7) Very enjoyable, really not at all difficult if you have a pulse and the story was really cool. My gripes are it was too easy, evil mode is rather boring, you age and everyone else does not, too short. Too short is the major gripe. The only difficult part is the prison sequence which was also the best drama of the story in my opinion, I actually got angry and then saddend by the events. --- They need to make a sequal which is much longer, actually has a point in evil mode and gives some simbalance of in game time with character age. ---  --- Buy it anywa	pos
Colin Firth plays a teacher and passionate to the point of obsessive football (soccer for Americans) fan who manages to mangle his only functional relationship, thanks to his tunnel vision when it comes to his obsession and fanatical support for Arsenal. His self-centered attitude with no concern at all for his girlfriend's interests muck up what could be a good relationship. On the other hand, it is hard to see in the first place what the woman finds so appealing about Firth's character, Paul. Perhaps because she is so uptight and needs to loosen up and sees in him a way by which to learn to be less rigid. She attempts to get involved in HIS passion but does not quite have the rabid, feverish passion he has. Eventually the fact that he identifies himself so closely with his football club and its ups and downs leads to the demise of the relationship, but she comes to see that she likes his identity, which is strong, linked to football or not. She has also been carried away by a certain infectious passion about football because it is so much a part of his life. Of course, one could argue that this tale is a sad reflection on the idea that there is a genderlect and that women suffer more in terms of being able to communicate, but that belies the point here that sometimes an imperfect person can still be perfect for someone who loves him, faults, obsessions and all	pos

The product works well for my space and needs. One note to Amaazon. When you ship a $400 item, thats semi fragile, and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball, how does the consumer deal with physical damage? The item is so massive to ship back, and most likey costly. --- I experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. I was worried how the shipping would be handled, and sure enough, I was worried rightfully. The DVD tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. The top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. Even with all the packing Samsung supplied, it could not protect the product from the shipping company. It will be such a hassle to try and exchange this, that I am not sure if I will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. Other than that, I have purchased smaller items, and less fragile from Amazon with no issues. I realize that the shipping damage canot be held on Amazon, as it is out of their control. I just don't think I will roll the dice on something like this in the future. Too bad, it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen	pos
In 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the United States was $19,806. 37 million people in the US live at or below this level. Ron Sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth. In Just Generosity, Sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in America. And it is a compelling vision. ---  --- Sider's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals. Both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty.   ---  --- Drawing upon biblical study, Sider presents the goal of an economy of justice: "Every person or family has access to productive resources (land, money, knowledge) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community" (81). Sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare, minimum wage, tax credits, health care, and education reform, showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work, empower the poor, and strengthen families. ---  --- Sider ends with this troubling question: Do enough Christians really care? This book should be required reading for any that do.	pos
Very short game, took about 2 hours to finish it (took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it, because as always their "system is unavailable, please try again later" - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable, and definately it will be the last steaming product I buy).  ---  --- As to the game, you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary. Gameplay was average for a shooter. It seems "episodes" basically translates to "really short game, which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something".	neg
Recently we had a chance to use a Bongo Board about 40 years old. It was all wood with quite a large drum. The one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons. It is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity. The drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost, and balance is frequently lost. Finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them. Great investment for year round fun	pos
New moon is an okay magazine, but some of the articals might bore you like about "Duck Tape fan." or something like that, it is sort of like a school magazine that teachers might want you to ONLY read in their class, but some of the stuff is good, I am a magazine freak and I have all the Discovery girls issues and it is nothing like new moon,  New moon has facts about not be mean but "Dead people." and that is just really boring. I suggest this magazine to a History fan or a science fan, because it is for you..  Discovery girls atleast has Celebrity interviews and makeup and things about crushes, and reader art and cool stuff, but this magazine has things like: ---  --- 1- a topic about stuff that is annoying and one girl was saying that she was not ''gay.'' but always was holding  her friends hand.. :0  it is gross... ---  --- 2- a fan of duck tape, it shows a picture of girl having tuck tape all over her.. Creepy.. ---  --- 3-  Wierd musems.. Uh sigh, boring! ---  --- I tried out this magazine thinking it was just what I needed, yeah right, it was boring, the only part I liked was the letters and the comics, ---  --- I suggest getting a subsription to BOP or discovery girls, because you wont enjoy this!  ---  --- PLUS it's 5.50! I am so mad because I wasted it  on this Crud. ---  --- I am 13 and this the second worst magazine I've read!  ---  --- The magazine  for any girl is Discovery girls, and my favorite issue is august/september 2004 because Taylor Dooley is on it. ---  ---  --- ** Check out my other reviews!** ---  --- 	pos

I orginally bought this at an auto parts store and realized that evening (after getting home and doing some online reasearch)that I could buy it on amazon.com for almost half the cost that I payed at the auto parts store.

After a week the cammera did not work. The shop has a return police, but they did not send a RA number needed to return the item. They asked me an adress in the USA, and whwn I sent it they did nor answered. In my country, Argentina, the local distributor said the garantee is not valid for them	neg
Blues singers shouldn't try to go mainstream. If they do try and succeed, fine. That means they've stayed true to their roots. When they try and fail (as Susan has done with Hope and Desire), one would hope they'd try to get back to where they started. For me that was Just Won't Burn. I guess when one is happily married with children, it's hard to sing the blues since you're not feeling them . . . you're faking them	neg

Using this product requires that you agree to turn over the keys to your computer. If you refuse an upgrade, Amazon can delete all of your previous purchases without giving you a refund. ---  --- This is a quote from Cory Doctorow, who wrote about the Terms of Service for Amazon Unbox (Amazon Unbox to customers: Eat !@#$ and die): ---  --- Amazon says it respects your privacy, but this clause tells the real story. Click "I agree" and you've just signed away permission for Amazon to wiretap all of your viewing habits, and to search your entire hard drive continuously and report back on all the software you've installed. The entertainment industry can produce a blacklist of legal software that it just doesn't care for -- say, software that lets you take screenshots, or screen-movies -- and refuse to allow your movies to run if you've installed it. In other words, this clause lets Hollywood specify how you must configure your PC. ---  --- Section 3c. Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you.  ---  --- Surprise!

I bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons.  Within the first 10 minutes of use, they both tipped over numerous times.  They tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor. Definitely not a sturdy trike.  My husband and I were very disappointed and returned them immediately. ---  --- In reading other reviews, I see that our experience with these trikes is not unique	neg
After reading a couple of other reviews about the "quality" of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black & white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and "suppossedly" in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this "Goodtimes Video" version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD	neg

Being sick and tired of shaving constantly and buying expensive blades, I did some research and decided to try an epilator.  I figured I'd give this model a try. I have not been disappointed!  Yes, it hurt the first time I used it--I hadn't shaved in almost a week and I had a lot of thick dark hair.  But, it was pulling it right out.  The more you use it, the less it hurts. I haven't had ugly, rough stubble since. I also like that Panasonic has included a shaver head--this works great to trim up too-long hairs before epilation or for the more sensitive areas that are just too painful to epilate.  The heads are easily interchangable and a snap to clean.  This is a great all-around epilator/shaver.   	pos
This is an inexpensive way to store lots of CD's, including those for a computer.   ---  --- This box is heavy cardboard, covered with waterproof vinyl, that is folded when delivered and snapped together.  You can't stand on one, but these boxes are still quite rugged -- at least as strong as plastic.   ---  --- A single box will hold 30 CD's in full jewel cases, 60 CD's in slim cases, or 165 CD's in envelopes.  That's a lot of CD's for not much money.   ---  --- I started with three boxes and am now buying them by the dozen.  You'll find lots of uses for them. 	pos
I affirm the positive comments of the other reviewers. I am a truck driver and dairy farmer and just finished the books on tape version of this book. I want to run away to graduate school and get at PHD in physics. I hated science in school. ---  --- I especialy recommend this book because it affirms  true learning. It really doesn't start until you fall in love with a subject and go after it just for the fun of it and for the most part on your own. Much of the book is about his love of physics and scientific exploration. He touches upon how to do education wrong with his stories about science education in Brazil and his  work selecting K-12 science texts for the LA school system. My independent road of becoming a dairy farmer affirms his thinking, and I am so glad I did not try to get an Ag degree	pos
I would recommend The Power of Simplicity to everyone.  This book goes far beyond a discussion of marketing strategy.  The idea of simplicity is relevent to all aspects of life.

My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product. 	neg

I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored.  --- The color didn't take! --- My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry.  --- The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  --- The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair. --- I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.	neg

The game disk does not run on my laptop. But it will play it on my desktop computer.  Very annoying, but at least I can play (other reviewers have not been so lucky). ---  --- The game has some good questions and I enjoy testing my Friends knowledge.  The game itself is rather simple and not totally fun.  The "game board" is the outside of the Friends' apartment building.  When you get a question right a window lights up.  When you get one wrong a window dims.  If you don't answer the question nothing happens.  You win when all the windows on that floor are lit up.  I would prefer that they make you answer all questions- none of this passing on a question- it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement. ---  --- If you play a multi-player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard!  It's silly for the two players to be huddled together, hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart. ---  --- There are SOME video clips and still images accompanying the questions, but it's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments.  Think Trivial Pursuit with a computer screen as the cards. ---  --- This game was a gift.  If I had to do it over again I'd probably spend my money instead on Scene It! Friends Edition.  As of right now, Scene It! Friends Edition is on sale at Circuit City for the same price as this game is on Amazon. (And though I haven't played it, the reviews of that game are much better than this one).	neg
Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.  ---  The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.  ---  Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's.	pos

This is my first review but I just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program. I bought this game when my children were in Kindergarten and second grade. Fritz and Chester's program is so engaging. There are rhymes and chants for each piece's moves as well as for some other "strategy-type" moves. For example, "A knight on the rim is ugly and dim." What a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in-play! This program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies. I would recommend getting Fritz and Chester 2 now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play! My boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade. Their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments. Fritz and Chester 2 is also great and my boys, now in third and sixth grade, still play it	pos

Truth be told, I should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and I think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively.  When this thing gets going, though, The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the way), one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner.  Are you kidding me?  Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn't believe - and subtlety?  How could I not give The Descent five stars? ---  --- So you've got these young British women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky, extreme activity.  White water rafting, for example.  Everyone has fun, but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), forever.  Still recovering from her terrible loss, Sarah joins her friend Beth (Alex Reid) in America, where mutual friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza), an Alpha Female if there ever was one, has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored.  Joining in the fun are Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno's new gung-ho sidekick, and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet.   ---  --- The movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the Appalachians (apparently somewhere in the North Carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the UK), then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure.  Once they descend into the cave system, though, things start getting more intense fairly quickly.  Their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal, especially for Sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses.  That's when Juno, a woman with more than her fair share of secrets, admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before, supposedly to help reunite the group.  Well, it does just the opposite, but they just have to keep going.  If there is a way out, they're going to have to find it the hard way. ---  --- Things are already creepy enough at this point.  The filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets, making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters.  Just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight, dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic.  But the real fun was just about to begin.  In the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you'll ever want to squirm through, Sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them.  No one believes her - at first.  When the "crawlers" attack, though, all hell breaks loose two miles under ground.  These Gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind, albino humanoids who hunt by sound, can scamper and climb like monkeys, move unbelievably quickly, and really tear into whatever flesh they can find.  Not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves, the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light.  And when the girls fight back, it's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy, bloody, gruesome department.  And even as characters are fighting for their lives, a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher.   ---  --- The ending is a little controversial because American theatrical audiences didn't get to see the true final scene of the film, for some pretty questionable reasons.  A few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference.  Don't worry, though, as the DVD has both endings available. ---  --- The Descent draws deeply from the well of man's most instinctual fears, making it one of the most atmospheric, heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while.  The subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between Sarah and Juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here.  The Descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that.  If you care the first thing about horror, you must see this atmospheric tour de force	pos
very efficiently drains about as much milk as I can get with the Pump in Style Advanced for me, and very portable and easy to clean. I use it when I have a little more time or when I don't expect to pump more than a couple ounces (between feedings). Despite Medela's warnings, I would say you could use this to pump daily, aslong as you  are careful to fully drain the breast (massage), but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row	pos
I bought this item based on other people's reviews. I'm sad to say they were wrong. Maybe it's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box.

My recommendation, well, just look at my title.	neg
Lot's of skiing, women that were hot in the nineties, and a little bit of cheese combine to make this the best drama of all time for skiiers.  This movie teaches essential survival skills like exactly how to handle a French jackass ski-instructor if he ever blames you for stealing his heli-ski clients.  What you do is offer to split the tip with them, then when he says with his french accent, "I don wan to split de tip", just slam your ski locker in his face and come up with an extremly witty comment, then call him an azzhole as you walk away.....brilliant!!   --- Also, what do you do when you've been invited up to the mansion of a European lady with enormous teeth and you search the whole house for her, only to find her her in the indoor swimming pool wearing nothing but the fur under her arms?  When she asks if you swim you answer, "like a fish" and whatever you do don't take your clothes off.  This would take too much time.  Just kick off your high-tops that aren't laced at the top and dive in.  When you come to the surface of the water, the hair flip to get water out of your face must be perfect or she may not invite you to stay the night.  PERFECT!!   --- I look at Aspen Extreme more as an instructional video for these situations.  Thanks TJ & Dex, because of you I now live in my van and life is sweet.   --- I'm kidding about all of this but it still is my favorite ski flick for sure. 	pos

I have used the Avent Isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump.  I was wrong.  Problems encountered include, it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight - they tend to leak, expensive - instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding, measurements are hard to read, they do not hold a full 8 ozs, due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily, and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as I forgot to pack it more than once!  Save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing.	neg

When I first got my phone, I was quite excited.  It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated.  From my research, I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours. --- 1)I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th.  This patch can be found on Palm support site. ---  --- 2) I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours. ---  --- Once I did these two things, my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge, and I've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive.  This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive. ---  --- I've had no problems with any of my SD cards or mini-SD cards.  The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo.  I've heard the various complaints, but you have to work through some of them.  it is a great phone	pos

With the greatest respect to the incredible Bob Beldon, Joe Zawinul, and Wayne Shorter, this Box Set should contain a warning. --- The warning is simple: If you already own most of the stuff in this collection, don't bother. If you're completely new to Weather Report, buy it. --- Coming from someone that's seen the band perform every year since 1972 and own all their official and quite a few "other" releases, I was really disappointed with this project (except for the booklet). ---  --- Here are a few things that are puzzling: ---  --- 1) A Weather Report Box Set includes three songs (two composed by Zawinul and one by Shorter) that were never released by Weather Report: --- a. In a Silent Way. released by Miles Davis --- b. Super Nova, released by Wayne Shorter --- c. Experience in E (Excerpt), released by Cannonball Adderly --- (I agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre-cursors, but mentioning them would have been enough - they are all in print) ---  --- 2) An incredible typo stating that Alphonse Mouzon was the drummer on "Unknown Soldier" ---  --- 3) Including a barely improved version of Nubian Sundance that has been in circulation for many years from "other" sources.  ---  --- 4) Including another "better than, but not by much" version of the "other" sources for the 1978 Rockpalast concert on DVD.  ---  --- 5) Not remastering any of the original recordings. The tape hiss from the Live in Tokyo (I Sing the Body Electric) songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age.   ---  --- 6) Finally, the cover itself - I have no words, except to admit "I don't get it". ---  --- Having said all that negative stuff - Weather Report remains the dominant "creative machine" of the Jazz Rock Fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating. If you're a long time Weather Report fan - there's absolutely nothing to get excited about here. The DVD was especially disappointing to me. I have had that concert on VHS tape for many years and now on DVD (all from "other" sources) and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version. Zawinul's black and white keys look like polka-dots in many places. (I played the DVD in 5 different players; two TV's and my computer monitor to make sure it wasn't my equipment).  I should have paid attention to the PR person at Sony that told me the concert was taken from a re-broadcast of the show and NOT from the master tapes. It's my own fault for having unrealistic expectations. I should probably clarify that while the DVD is in fact clearly better than the "un-offical" version, IT STILL LOOKS LIKE A BOOTLEG! Sad... ---  --- It is of some significance that this "review" is the first time I've chosen to speak out about something in Fusion that was less than flattering. It should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at CBS/Sony/BMG and not the musicians/producers.  ---  --- I'm still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered Mahavishnu Orchestra Live in Cleveland Cd that was supposed to be released in 2004.  ---  --- Lastly, let me make it perfectly clear that Zawinul, Shorter, and Beldon are musicians and people I personally hold in the highest esteem with Zawinul and Shorter being musical divinities as far as I'm concerned. While my review is an obvious personal venting, and I realize that Zawinul and Shorter gave this project their stamp of approval, I think that shouldn't be mistaken for a personal attack. My remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at CBS/Sony/BMG.  ---  --- By Rick Calic --- Jazz Rock World	neg

Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of Angela Bennett.  In this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert. An online hacker friend calls to tell her he's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out.  Unfortunately, he's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her. The disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the U.S. government. Angela Bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has, she finds that she's being stalked. What happens next is everyone's worst nightmare. Through the miracle of computers, the evil group steal Angela's identify and there are few people to vouch for her. The story quickly turns into a cyber thriller. ---  --- She tries to get help, but she appears to have no friends and doesn't even know her own neighbors. Her mother (Diane Baker) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from Alzheimer's.  Her former boyfriend, played by Dennis Miller does try to help her, but the forces of evil are difficult to hide from.  ---  --- Jeremy Northam delivers a spine tingling performance as the charming and mysterious Jack Devlin.

I purchased this product with the hope that it will help me protect my computer without too much overhead and interference. The password manager is quite useless. In more than half the times it did not enter passwords. In cases where it entered passwords, it took about 5 seconds to do so.

When I contacted Symantec support, their response is to disable the Phishing protection when I want to go to these sites. ---  --- My quicken started having problems. I had to restore old backups and it took me 2 days to finally figure out that it is Confidential that is causing the problems. I would have given this s/w 0 stars if it is possible. Now, I uninstalled the software from my computer and have no intention of re-installing it. ---  --- I can't believe that a company like Symantec releases software that is so buggy and unusable	neg
What has happened to the song "Lives in the balance" on this set?  If you go to his website it sounds really great!!!  On this set it sounds awfull!!  It sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with.  The packaging if you could call it that is really lame.  Foam dots for holders?  What do you do when those fall off?  I suppose you put the cd's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up.  Not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work!  True you do get alot of songs for the money but, there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it.  If you own an I-pod I suggest you go to apples I-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less	pos

Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issues ---  --- Cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless. ---  --- This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for "X-Fi popping/crackling".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial "hacked" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the "the fastest sound processor" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices.  ---  --- Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars. ---  --- UPDATE 06/12/2006 --- I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)	neg

This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.

I bought an epilator because I was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me.  I've had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing amazing results!   ---  --- I used it for the first time on my legs.  I'm not going to lie...It was painful.  I just made sure to go slowly, pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as I could get it.  Eventually, I was able to get most of the thick, dark hairs off of my legs.   ---  --- **Please know that the Epilator is not an immediate "cure-all".  Hair grows in stages, so as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind them.  (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them, but it will take some time.)  Because of this, it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week.  Since it's winter, I just let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown.  It doesn't hurt nearly as much to pull those out!  I also know that I'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter.  My legs are smoother and I don't get razor burn!  Right after epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but, unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time.     ---  --- Another neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs.  This gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth!  I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed.  Now, I get smoother skin just about whenever I want to!     ---  --- I was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product I had not heard much about.  With the exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in the dark.  I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks!  Not only have I epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper lip, and on my bikini line.  The results have been better than I could have imagined!!   ---  --- Again, I'm not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days (I have very thick hairs).  However, I got the majority of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I'm never going to have to shave again!  Yes, some little blonde hairs grow back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful.  In fact, sometimes it tickles a little.  :o)  I epilate there once to twice a week (about a five minute job if you're being careful, two if you're in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms!   ---  --- I used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month.  Now I just epilate.  It hurts, but just for a second.  Plus, I keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to pull 5-10 each time.     ---  --- **A word of caution: Our skin is more sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line, be careful.  I managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating "blade".  Now I just make sure that I don't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds.  If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get them. ---  --- This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs (I've only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a little cleaning brush.  The epilator is very easy to clean.  The top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot water.  When it dries, you put it back on.  **Note, the epilator does not store hairs inside of it.  When they are pulled out, they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying.  I sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs.   ---  --- I hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator.  I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time.   ---  --- **Are the few minutes of pain worth it???  ABSOLUTELY!  :o) ---  ---     --- 	pos

I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying. --- So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is "normal" or will be "outgrown."  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!	neg

 --- I've always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate, and that rate has sped up since I'm now a Romance Coach.  But somehow I had missed Susan Page's "If I'm So Wonderful, Why am I Still Single?" even though it has been out since 1998, the last year I was single myself.  Where have I been, and why hadn't I seen this book? ---  --- Susan Page writes for "involuntary singles" -- straight, gay, male or female, each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't.  Relentlessly positive, she starts off right to the point with "So why are you still single anyway?"  And then, just when we've gotten over that shock, she states flatly:"Whatever your reasons are for being single, if you want to be in a relationship, no reason is good enough."  Then Page goes about tearing apart every good reason we've ever come up with to keep ourselves single. ---  --- Here's what Page takes on and turns around: Ambivalence (my favorite), those "Dreadful Statistics," the myth of "There are no good ways to meet people," and having and keeping high standards.  Then she works on developing skills in what she calls "Frog kissing":  Learning to say no, how to recognize true intimacy, avoiding "commitmentphobes," handling the intimacy gap, and learning to say "yes."  And in the last section, "Keeping It All Together While You Look," Page tells you just how to do all that.   ---  --- This is easily the best, most thorough, rounded and positive book about relationships and dating I have seen.  If you are one of Page's "involuntary singles," this book needs to be in your library.  Five chocolate dipped strawberries for Susan Page!  This is quite a book.   	pos

Another down side is you have to take the mattress completly out of the crib to put it on. It is a safe fit, and washes well. I ment to give it 3 stars	neg
Works real well for leg exercises, but when doing arm exercises it tends to slide downwards	pos
Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product	pos
We've had one in the house for a few years now. The kids (5 and 2-1/2) love it. It's soft, cuddly, and sized just right for them. It's been taken all over the place, has provided companionship for them on many a long trip (including two to South Korea), given comfort when they are sad, and been used for countless hours of make-believe. Its worth has been far more than what was paid for it	pos
Dissapointed with this product! Our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart! Small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys	neg
Leave it to me to start into a series in its' second, third, or fourth installments. In this case, it's the fourth. Course, there's a good explanation why. I set out looking for Final Fantasy I&II: Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance(Hey, if you're going to collect a series, it's a good thing to start at the beginning) at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead. There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance.The story goes like this..The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals. The commander of its air force, Cecil, has been dismissed after questioning the king's motives. With the help of others; Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and, in the meantime, uncovers a far more dangerous one. It's a deep story with alot of twists and turns & is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system. I can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games.  ---  --- Although they tweaked the graphics, translation and whatnot abit, they pretty much made the game as it was originally. I think Final Fantasy fans as well as casual RPG gamers will really enjoy this one.	pos
If you don't like getting attention, these are not for you.  I'm often surprised by people's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off; I'm so accustomed to pulling them apart, that I forget how unusual the viewing public finds it.   ---  --- I have been wearing Clics for nearly a year.  I pretend that I don't need glasses, but of course I do and have for nearly a decade.  Popped the standard diopter lenses out, and put in my bifocal prescription.  It worked great, despite a warning from my optical shop.  (And even if they had broken from the experiment, the price is right:  I could try it again.) ---  --- Previously I was wearing glasses on a chain.  Besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer, I also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching. Then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break.   ---  --- I call the color of mine "magenta" - which may or may not be the same as the online "red" - I bought them in a shop (**gasp**).  My short hair is not a problem, but I agree that reading in bed doesn't work.  So I use a different pair for those occasions	pos
Everyone of us usually loves to make a fresh cup of coffee in the morning. Nevertheless, getting the best quality filters are definitely the biggest hastle for your coffeemaker. These Melita Cone #2 coffee filter are one of the best made filters around. They are woven tight, and completely seperate the ground coffee from spilling into your carafe, or your mug if you use Melita's Perfect Brew mug coffee makers. I like these a whole lot because they really help make the best coffee around. If you want to make a great cup of coffee, than you'll definitely want to get some of the best filters available. I definitely suggest you buy these #2 Coffee Filters. It is a definite buy, so drink up! ---  --- Price: B+ ---  --- Quality: A- ---  --- Overall: B+	pos
Samsung has a great phone with the Black Jack.  Unfortunately, the headset jack is not a standard jack, but instead one unique to Samsung phones.  Therefore, you are forced to buy Samsung's headset.  Bottom line -- don't bother.  The design is horrible.  The earbuds don't stay in the ear.  What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord.  Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear.  I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones. 	neg
This is a wonderful book that catches the subtle and yet glaring clashes of outlook on country and escape, grounded firmly in love and faithfulness.   It moves quickly;  I was afraid of a tragedy at the end but the resolution is quietly reassuring and poignant.  The grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of Julie and Abu.  And it is not transient but deepens.   Miriam, Abu's sister, remains with me in her moving quietude, and the litle girl Lela, hand in hand with Julie, plucks deep	pos
These are very pretty without too much fluff. The leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab. I love them	pos
Being a bodybuilder, I hoist heavy weights all the time; a major stress especially when it comes to squats.  I ordered the boots when I realized I had shrunk to 5'10.5" from being 6'0.5".  I was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging (5 times a week, 10-15 min intervals) that I am nearly back to my original height (6' 0.25").  I highly suggest this product as a supplement to good [emphasis on good] chiropractic care.   --- To those who have/will order this product, don't be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first; that's totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs [which cushion the vertebrate] start rehydrating.  Also, it will take some time to find the strap tightness that's right for your legs.  Generally, tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination. --- p.s.  Hang from a real pull-up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself.	pos

I cannot believe how mean and down-dirty elections can get when they get too close.  Does it tell us something about the election process.  It needs to become kinder.   Democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it.

Good awareness piece though.	pos
Richard Fortney's "Earth" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and how it relates to humankind.  Fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.   ---  --- Fortney starts at Mount Vesuvius in Italy, preceeds to the Hawaiian Islands, hence to the Swiss Alps and to other locations aroudn the world.  Fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is.  This leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the "supercontinent" of Gondwana.  For each location, Fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location.  Along the way, Fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes.  The dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective. ---  --- Fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote.  Large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences.  It turns out, for example, that the complicated geology of Newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates (North America, ocean bottom, and Northern Europe).  The descriptions of Northwest Scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by Fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the Scottish Highlands. ---  --- The narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages, and Fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader.  Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history	pos
Purchased this item for traveling. Our son doesn't travel well. So we purchased this item for him and it doesn't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows.

I purchased two of these, both coffee makers arrived without an instruction manual, not that you really need one.   The outside of the box says have coffee in a few minutes, I guess it depends who defines a few minutes.   Both makers took 20 minutes to heat just one cup of water.  To make a pot, that would be 100 minutes.   I am returning as I am definitely disappointed	neg

I like this humidifier alot but now I cannot find replacement filters for it. I only had it for about 3 months and now I cannot find replacement filters. This unit was not cheap either, it did cost money and now for it to basically be brand new and not to be able to find filters is really fustrating. I would not recommend this humidifier for this reason only	neg
I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16	neg
After college I moved back home for a few months before getting my own place. It was totally a sitcom setup in that I lived in my mom's basement - but the mice and spiders down there were not funny at all. I didn't really mind the mice running around every now and then, but when one got under the covers with me, I had enough. I went to a local brick & mortar store and bought all kinds of different traps, deterrents, etc to try to get them out or trap them without harming the critters (Mom wouldn't have it). I bought a single two-pack of these things and immediately after I plugged the first one in, I saw two mice immediately come out of their hiding spot and scurry to the unfinished part of the basement. Having one in my bedroom and one in the bathroom in the basement was enough for me, but Mom's husband was so impressed that he bought about a dozen more for the rest of the basement (lots of separate rooms) and the garage. ---  --- Definitely read the tips and suggestions - they will only work if there is a large, open space so put this in an outlet that has a "full view" of the room. Each room will need it's own, and a very large room (like a two-bay garage) will need two or three. ---  --- We put these up about three years ago and there hasn't been a mouse in the basement since	pos
I absolutely adore Elle Decoration - as several other reviewers have noted, unfortunately, the American version can't compare.  The spaces are gorgeous, and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious.  All of my American magazines (with the exception of Interior Design) get ripped apart, with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed - Elle Decoration always gets saved in its entirety. I highly recommend - these magazines are eye candy, and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import.	pos
Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, "Reptile," makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with "Backless," "Another Ticket," and "Money & Cigarrettes" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans	neg
I cannot speak for all devices, but this was a total failure in my case.  I am a fast typist, and it seemed that about 20% of the keystrokes were not picked up by my Treo 270.  This was simply unacceptable, so I immediately returned it.  I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA.  Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.  My suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your PDA	neg

Wow, this book should be given to every graduate entering the workforce along with their diploma.

A fantasy, dealing with the curse of star-crossed lovers, Ladyhawke never fail to be top-notch entertainment. The cast is exceptional, and get their characters right. It's all too easy to fall into the story and believe what's going on. ---  --- Along with "Dragonslayer", this is one of the top fantasy movies. The story is compelling, the setting has a very gritty, dirty feel to it, and the location just adds to the overall feeling of living in the middle ages. ---  --- This is not a movie I can just put on 'in the background' and let play while doing other things, because it suck me in every time	pos
It was broken in a few days of use, you should buy a hard cover instea	neg
I found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research & of tracking earnings estimates. Mitch Zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform. The Zacks Rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years...It seems as if the Zacks Rank really is accurate, and more imporartantly a successful investing method...This is the first book I have read that has actually helped  me make money, rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads. Overall good book, I would definitely recommend it	pos

I am a huge fan of tea. I have been drinking this one for years. I am astonished at the price -- such a great deal. Anyway, if you must buy tea in a box, this is one to purchase.

I have been using this mouse at work since it came out. After many miles of use, the scroll wheel has finally started to fail.  I can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls.  The best feature of this mouse is the battery life.  A coworker who swears by his Logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months, but I usually got at least ten months out of mine.  I even took to dating the batteries when I installed them, just to rub it in. ---  --- This mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some, but overall I would recommend it. ---  --- Going to try a rechargable Logitech next time around	pos

Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me. I've read many Barr books, and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters, it's hard to keep them straight. In this book, that was the last of my worries. I didn't even finish it, I was so turned off	neg
I chanced upon this book quite by accident.I am a big fan of books which inspire.This may not be a book which is high on the literary quotient, the writing does get rambling and long winded quite a number of times.But whats truly awe inspiring is its straight up from the heart.Its quite amazing that someone can go through so many emotions in a lifetime and actually make peace with all thats happened in a lifetime. --- This book will give you plenty to think about long after you are done with it	pos

This product arrived with 2 number 2 installation disks for the Virtual PC and no number 1.

I suppose I'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first I've tried, but I really, really enjoy this matcha. It's smooth, mellow, and slightly sweet. I'm picky about loose green teas for steeping; some of those are bitter, & I DON'T like bitter tea. So my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price	pos
Not as they appear!, March 8, 2007 --- Reviewer: Rappster (Denver, CO) - See all my reviews  --- I ordered these earrings on a 'Gold Box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive. They were SUCH a disappointment, I returned them the next day. I did not expect the diamonds to be huge, based on their cttw, but the earrings themselves are miniscule! They look like they were made for children. I tried on one earring and couldn't even SEE the earring in my ear, much less tell there were any diamonds--it looked like I didn't even have an earring on! ---  ---  ---   --- 	neg
If you are searching for Adirondack chairs, like I did a few weeks ago, you will find a wide array of prices--too ridiculous to mention.  This strathwood for 79.99 and 10 for shipping is a STEAL!  I have not been able to find them cheaper anywhere! ---  --- You get the chair and the foot stool which is why I rated it 4 stars.  The quality is decent, I think for the price you get what you pay for and a bit more.  The kit comes almost constructed--you have do the final screws. ---  --- The chair comes pre oiled, however I highly recommend oiling it again, if you want the color to last.  I also recommend Teaqua, do not use conventional Teak oil.  I do agree with the previous reviewer that if you sit in the chair for an hour it can get uncomfortable, however I purchased cushions for it, and sitting for an hour has not been a problem. ---  --- The construciton is sturdy, they have been sitting on my deck for about a month now and all is well.  ---  --- Mahalo	pos
Was shopping at the mall.  This item caught my husband's eye in the window.  We went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it's uses.  We actually bought one for ourselves.  It came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland (going and returning home).  Especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight.  I was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn't. ---  --- We foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages.  It's a two-man operation.  My husband would lift the luggage/bag, then I would look at the scale quickly	pos

I remember way back in '80 when this movie was the buzz of Hollywood. That is, the buzz on Johnny Carson.  The media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself. ---  --- Yet, in the mid 80's, it came out on both Betamax and VHS, and naturally I bought me a Beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was. ---  --- First, it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption.  It is long and intraclly woven together.  it is lavish and sometimes loud.  It is a brutal slap in the face to "Manifest Destiny" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is "God's" country.  As if their 'God" gave them wealth and privilige and that this God justifies revolution, massacre and war. ---  --- Many comparisons can be mase with the America of the late 19th century and the America ruled presently by King George W. and his robber barons of Capitalism.  But it is now, as then, much more conveniant to steer the "common man" into their churches, into their army,  into their lies.  The enemy is those "illegal aliens" those in the "gay agenda," those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo.  Kris Kristofferson plays a mayor/sherriff if wealth and means who (shock-shock) sides with the common man and the undertrodden.  When another of his "breeding and class" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class, he replies to the creep:  "You are not of my class, to be of my class you first have to die and be born again!" ---  --- This is a revolutionary movie, meant to be savored, each and every minute of it.  This movie dares you to look at  things usually not into history books or shown on the History Channel	pos
Obviously the pearls are flawed, but because of their size you can't tell even from a short distance away. ---  --- They're super cute, but I suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own	pos

I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.

Vanilla Sky is either a disappointment when viewed against Indie Film standards, or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget / low-minded Hollywood that's released weekly. ---  --- On the plus side, we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind. A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity: the movie we like to talk about later. Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over. ---  --- Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take. ---  --- On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall. ---  --- Rating: B- / C+ ---  --- FYI:  --- 1) When did the universe change so much that "Banky" from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise? --- 2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects? --- 3) When did Paul McCartney last have a decent single?

Well, I'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the A/V world. ---  --- I bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up.  This is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up.    ---  --- Just buy and extra after market battery or two (and they're cheap) and some inexpensive analogue tape, and start recording away! ---  --- After you climb the learning curve, of course.  My one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive, and they're splattered all over the unit.  Be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing, but once you've got it down you'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays.   ---  --- Oh yeah, almost forgot, the microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good for an entry level unit	pos
Set in Venice at the end of World War II, Hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old American colonel and Renata, a young and very pretty Italian contessa.  Loss is a recurring theme--the death of many of the Colonel's subordinates in combat, the break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman, and the severe injury to one of the Colonel's hands from which he suffers constant pain.  The Colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short. ---  --- What gives the novel so much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion Renata and the Colonel have for one another.  Renata seeks to comfort the Colonel and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness.  The Colonel lovingly calls Renata, "daughter." ---  --- Hemingway tells this tale in the deceptively simple, direct, and matter of fact style for which he is justly celebrated.  I could have done without the duck hunting sequences and some of the Colonel's more obvious macho behavior, but Hemingway, being Hemingway, understandably could not. ---  --- This is a lovely and sad story, filled with the yearnings of its two lead characters	pos

$23 for the Chinese version and the English subtitles are mad.   The English subtitles available on American cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable.  I don't regret this purchase because I think drama sets SHOULD be $25 tops and the camera is so CLEAR on this dvd compared to what is seen on American cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are.  It made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for ME when I didn't really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable.  ---  --- So what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series?  I don't get the appeal of this show at all.  I thought it was really slow.  My favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise I felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk, breath in, breathe out, and ponder ponder.  I think the phenomenon of the show's popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring.  Just thinking about this show, strips another layer of elasticity from my heart. It's so boring.  ---  --- p.s. This drama got a 20% rating domestically but Sam Soon and Jang Geum scored 50%.  Hahaha	neg
I am in my mid 30's.  I am not a Britney fan at all.  I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  My husband and I are both picky about perfume.  I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit.  Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it.  I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache.  I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone	pos
Thanks for keeping a Brit sane in a country full of "My wife says..." jokes. ---  --- Your wife is fat and ugly and I don't care what she says. Because she's ugly. And fat... ---  --- ..and not my wife	pos
Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they "...won't bother fixing it again..." and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract	neg
I am so glad I tried this coffee! I also shared some with my neighbor, who has a business, and she took some to the office with her, and now it's the only coffee they want!

My husband and I are both history and literature buffs, so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to DVD. We aren't typically hard people to please, but this film was one of the most boring movies that I've seen to date. It's not that I don't appreciate artistic, visually stimulating movies - that have a point. Perhaps, assuming we all knew the story already, the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass, water, trees...and more trees. Apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever (though I will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there), this movie represents revisionist history at its worst. Here we are presented with an idyllic, practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the Noble Savage juxtaposed against the muddy, disgusting, conniving white man. Perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some Native American life like scalping, or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs. It's fair to say, as the Post-Colonial talk goes, that Native Americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years. But by shifting to the other extreme, don't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction	neg
This has to be the best investment you can make towards your child before they are born, and the results will effect them for their whole life!  It felt like a big commitment for me to have to run the program 2 times a day, and near the end of my pregnancy I was annoyed with having anything strapped across my belly, but I am so glad I pushed through.  My daughter is AMAZING!  I am in awe at her sweet spirit and her advancement.  Baby Plus did everything it promised and more!  Here are some examples: ---  --- At birth: eyes wide open, hands open, instant excellent nurser, slept 4-6 hours at night, very calm and happy, cried only when hungry. --- At 1 month: smiling all the time at everyone, sleeping 8-10 hrs. at night., recognized mom and dad's faces. --- At 2 months: laughing, holding head up --- At 3 months: pressing buttons on toys for 6mos +, rolling both directions, holding own bottle --- At 4 months: sitting with support --- At 5 months: sitting without support, drinking from sippy cup, singing, saying first words --- At 6 months: puts self to sleep, pulled self to standing position, creeping... and now almost crawling. ---  --- I am completely amazed at her advancements.  People mistake her for being 3-6 months older than she is, and they say she is the happiest baby they have ever known. ---  --- I am totally sold on Baby Plus	pos

We have 2 kids in a 2-bedroom apartment.  When our 2nd child was born, we put him in our bedroom.  There is not much space there, so this portable crib was a great find!  We use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it.    ---  --- Pros: saves space, folds, easy to move from room to room (on wheels), really easy to change the sheets (compared to regular crib with heavy matress).  It also has very neutral color and style, so it fits really well with other traditional furniture. ---  --- Cons: the baby will outgrow it in about 1 year, the matress is extremely thin (about 1 inch!).  We bought an extra matress (the normal thickness) for about $20.  To find it, do a search for "portable crib matress"	pos

I bought a copy of this magazine and initially enjoyed a great deal of it, but ultimately found it distasteful.  It was graphically hyperactive, which became distracting and irritating, and there was something else that didn't seem quite right, though at first I couldn't identify just what that was.  Eventually I realized that it wasn't making a clear distinction between the editorial content and commerce (items offered by companies advertizing in the magazine, workshops sponsored by the magazine, books sold by the publisher of the magazine).  Eventually I figured out that the publisher was Australian.  If Rupert Murdoch is any guide, then this magazine is coming from a tradition that doesn't respect boundaries between journalism and financial gain.  I ended up putting this magazine aside in distaste	neg

This watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use.  Whenever I need to remember to check the dryer or the stove, all I have to do is push one button to the number of minutes I want to wait.  Its the only watch I wear and I never take it off.  I even swim with it on.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is so plain.  I wish Casio would make it in a pretty color	pos
My 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so I stopped putting her in the crib because I was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much I was afraid of her hurting herself. So now I love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and I don't have to worry. They were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat. Great product! I highly recommend it!!!!	pos

Due to a canoe accident on vacation, mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds. But - only a trickle of water got inside. Once that dried out, much to my surprise, both the AF and VR functions worked fine.

I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book. ---  --- The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste	neg
Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro). ---  --- I went to the support page of the web site, and found a FAQ item about incompatibility with Zone Alarm.  If you're not familiar with Zone Alarm, it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users.  According to Nova Development, the only way to get Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove Zone Alarm.  Besides being a serious security risk, this is an extreme measure to have to take.  This seems to be perfectly OK with Nova Development.  They offer no workaround other than removing Zone Alarm from the PC.  Personally, this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if I did not use Zone Alarm.  You have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it. --- 	neg

The satin finish and the design are very attractive.  I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it primed but after that it worked great.  You might want to prime it with water instead of shampoo to get things going.  The directions, which I lost, said something about priming. ---  --- Installation was easy.  It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips.  I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure.  I figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and use Goof Off to remove the adhesive. ---  --- If you fill one of the chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural sponge.  I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough	pos
This is the absolute cutest general neutral baby bedding set out there.  The colors are fabulous, the material is soft and nice, and I was SO pleased by its overall quality.  We also purchased some of the extras, (the lamp, pillow, and wall hangings) and were just as pleased.  I would reccommend this bedding to any person expecting a child that doesn't wish to know the gender before it's born, but also any parent that does know, be assured, it is great for a girl or boy, especially if you like animals!! 	pos
I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun.  I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice.  It would not run.  I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run.  When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system.  In short, if you have an "over the counter" system, you cannot run this game on your computer.  I find this ridiculous and disappointing.  I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play.  Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box	neg
I've a Norton user for many years.  I 'upgraded?' from NAV 2005.  This product was a pain to install.  I had to uninstall Zone Alarm, which isn't noted anywhere.  I've never had to do that before.

I was very unimpressed with this movie. "Borat" suffers from the same delusion as Sarah Silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect AUTOMATICALLY equals funny. It does not. Of course sometimes it can be hilarious (and Borat does have moments like that), but overall I did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing. Especially the scene where the naked friend sits on Borat's face was just disgusting and it dragged on and on and on. At some point I just fast forwarded it. You're not missing much if you don't watch this movie	neg

Kurzweil opens with a very heartfelt recounting of his return to Judaism and his personal path which led him to Rabbi Steinsaltz.

This is for everyone who wants to know more about not only Steinsaltz, but the beauty and wisdom of the Jewish faith	pos

The antioxidant properties of Goji Berries are ones you can feel immediately upon consuming them.  They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous.  If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries. ---  --- My only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry.  So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth.  I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.  Soaking them is ideal, and then using the juice in smoothies, not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the  water.   	pos

The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either. ---  --- Has Andy Dick ever been funny? Kimmel? Corolla? Sarah Silverman? Spade post-Farley? No. It's as if Comedy Central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years. ---  --- And the bonus features are horrible. The interviewer was annoying--even the guests seemed annoyed with her. ---  --- Was Gilbert Gottfried not available? That guy is funny	neg
I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I should --- have bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco always --- shaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy.  --- Oh well, I waited too long to send it back	neg
We all know how great the songs are on this CD -- 5-Star all the way. ---  --- However, I guess there's an unlucky few oddballs among us who can't play the SACD hybrid CD format of this particular reissue on our PC.  Which also means that we can't add the CD to our iTunes or iPod music selections.  In this day and age, that's severely limiting, so I regret this purchase (I don't have some jalopy of a PC/processor either, as my computer is less than seven months old, with 2GB of RAM). ---  --- I don't know who to blame for my "mistake" -- myself?  Amazon?  Sony?  Philips?  ABKCO? ---  --- I'll blame myself and be more careful next time -- in part by avoiding "DSD-" or "SACD-" labeled items. ---  --- I'll also give the CD 1 Star on the basis of its limited technological usefulness to me	neg
My 2yr old got this one and another Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving them around.  ---  --- The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very durable	pos
Published in 1986, Dr. Deming "Out of the Crisis" seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in American management mentality. Two main subjects are discussed in the book. The first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations, the second, relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way American management operates. 14 core points are suggested by Dr. Deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods.  --- Throughout the book, Dr. Deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the American Industry, and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership. At times, the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow, but overall, Dr. Deming's concepts are transferred to the reader. Dr. Deming's "Out of the Crisis" helped me learn new perspectives about how management and employees can help in building or transforming an industry to a successful one.    	pos

Let's make this clear... I won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. So this is going to be short and sweet!  This book is a glorified magazine.  Worth $14.95 - tops.  The pitfalls of bookbuying online, I guess.  You never know what you are going to get.  Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared.  The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared.  The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films.  Throughout the book the author treats these two as the "Coke and Pepsi" of infrared films.  I'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same	neg

The Big Bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the cheapest $1.99 jugs.  The only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate).  My youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard.  I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back.  ---  --- If I had to gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution. ---  --- We also go through a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand.  But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard	pos

I started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81. It was EXCELLENT!! It had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to "preventing" ailments/conditions.

I started with Caesar2 back when it came out. I played it for hours and hours and loved it. When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing. Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed. Things have changed! ---  --- I'm spending more and more of my time restarting Caesar4 than I am playing it. About 8 out of 10 times that I access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes. Without trading, you make little money and the game is essentially over. ---  --- Other problems I'm seeing is overall performance. I don't have the fastest machine (AMD 2.1ghz, 512ram, rockin' video card with 256meg of mem) but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes. I find the whole game to be difficult to use. This was not the case with Caesar3. ---  --- Unless they issue a patch, I'm done feel frustrated with crashes.

I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed. ---  --- One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring.  I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games.  Too bad for them.  Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me	pos

The retro-slinky dog, however cute, just doesn't work.  We have tried it on the hardwood floor, the carpet, the title.  We have tried tying a string arounds it's neck, adding a string to it's short stubby string, using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works.  Our kids 2 & 6 just drag it around laying on it's side--it's just not fun--the head is too heavy and it doesn't move well at all.  I would not buy it.  the Fisher Price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright, it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length--plus it's cute too!! 	neg
The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses).  The recurring image of the forest in German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time.  Therefore, what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction. ---  --- In the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister.  The Brothers Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane Doe).  Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl."   ---  --- All that background makes it rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries."  This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar around her neck, and torn fish net stockings.  There are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage, Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood.  She also has a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the Grimms tale). ---  --- Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a twisted sense of humor.  With these figures McFarlane Toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level.  Even if you do not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you	pos

I am a new harmonica player trying to substitute shopping and technical research for practice and talent.  I went out and bought nearly every diatonic harmonica under 40 bucks.  Most fell by the wayside.  I still use the Special 20 every day for a couple of reasons. The one I have is easy to play.  And only the plastic cone touches your lips, not the brass plate that sticks out on lots of Hohners.  (That's the only reason the Golden Melody comes in second for me.)  Overall, it just feels really nice in your hand, smoother even than the non-stick Pro models.   ---  --- Unless you are shopping addicted, as I am, this is the only harmonica you are going to need for a long time	pos
I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds.  In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale.  However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood.  In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest.  There are no hinges on the back.  I am very disappointed with this tea "chest" AND it's price	neg
This is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about. It is about laughs. It is a comedy that takes place in the old west. ---  --- Mel Gibson plays a professional gambler, Brett Maverick,  who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament. The entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars. He has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him, always with hilarious results. As he makes his way towards to tournament, he encounters another gambler, played by Jodie Foster, who also wants to enter the tournament. She too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket. The final main character is the US Marshall played by James Garner. He does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well. He has been hired to provide security. ---  --- As they make their way to the big event, all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others. The Indians get involved and come across as the funniest, most honest and most intelligent people around. They finally get Maverick his stake (with lots of laughs) and the stage is set for the big tournament. ---  --- The tournament itself is full of laughs, surprises, twists and turns. It also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars. All of this is fun but the interplay between Gibson, Foster and Garner is the real fun.  ---  --- Get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing.	pos

 I just bought a Xbox 360 Pro System a couple of weeks ago from my local Gamespot Store along with Call of Duty 3.  I later on got Gears of War from Circuit City. ---  ---  The Xbox 360 Pro System is by far the best console system out there no matter what anybody says for the money. Yes the Sony PlayStation 3 has the Blu-Ray disc media format and the Nintendo Wii system has the new remote controller for 3-D movement. But both the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems just came out and both systems already have major bugs in them.  There are already alot of people out there who regret buying one of those systems. ---  ---  If your smart, you'll wait a year until all the bugs are fix in both those console systems and then think about purchasing one of those systems.  That is what I did with the Xbox 360.  Yes there were major problems with the Xbox 360 when it first came out just like there are major problems now with the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems.  I waited a year until Microsoft fixed all the bugs in the Xbox 360 and then I went out and purchased it. ---  ---  Right now the Xbox 360 has the best selection of games out there. The Xbox Live Marketplace is the best online service out there.  Go read the reviews for the few games that are out for the PlayStation 3 and you will see what I mean about which system has better games to play.  There are already a huge selection of games to play on the Xbox 360 with a whole bunch of new games for the Xbox 360 coming out next year.  Unfortunately, there are not too many new games coming out for the PlayStation 3 or the Nintendo Wii next year. ---  ---  Also, the Nintendo Wii has very poor graphics and you can't play DVD movies on it and the PlayStation 3 has very few games to choose from to play and it also has poor online service.  The Xbox 360 is already one year ahead of the other two systems on being out in the retail market and that, my friend, will make a huge difference on which system to choose from to go out to buy and play. 	pos
If you are accustomed to using other versions of CorelDraw, you may not want this version. Fact is, they have made many so-called "improvements" which I find are incompatible with other software that I have used in the past. It does not convert to encapsulated postscript (eps) files properly, and will crash programs that traditionally work well with eps figures. By contrast, CorelDraw 11 worked well. Hence the "improvement" has rendered the software a nuisance. If you are accustomed to pasting figures into other software, forget it. CorelDraw X3 will not retain the integrity of the original figure, and it will look distorted and crummy. Any prior version of CorelDraw worked well. Again, the "improvement" has made the software a nuisance. On top of that, it crashes a lot.  ---  --- I contacted their "customer service" about a year ago when I first discovered these differences. I was assured that they knew about the problems and were working on them. Well, a year later, with no patches to correct these differences, I am now being told that it is everyone else's fault (software manufacturers) that CorelDraw is not compatible. I was also told that they have no intention to correct these problems because they do not consider them problems. There is an example of their customer service for you.  ---  --- I have been using CorelDraw for a long time, starting with 6, then 9, then 11. This is the worst of the bunch by far. I am going back to a previous version.	neg

Herman Wouk's book `Winds of war' became a bestseller upon its publication, just like its sequel `War and Remembrance' a few years later. These thick books, joining the fictional and historical events during Second World War, provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the TV miniseries. This 6-DVD set covers the first book, with an 18-hour series shot in 1983. ---  --- The plot concerns a military family named Henry, scattered and absorbed by the winds of war. We follow the patriarch Victor `Pug Henry (Robert Mitchum), an experienced military officer who in the spring 1939 is appointed to be a military attaché for the USA in Berlin. He is accompanied by his dotty and yet quite likable wife Rhoda (Polly Bergen). Their children include an oldest son, the flyboy Warren (Ben Murphy), another son Byron (Jan-Michael Vincent) who is in Italy and falls in love with a bit older Jewish girl Natalie (Ali McGraw), who is the niece of the famous American-Jewish writer dr. Aaron Jastrow (John Houseman). The daughter Madeleine (Lisa Eilbacher) is the youngest of the three and works as a radio girl. In Berlin Pugh gets the hint of the atmosphere in the Nazi Germany of that time (like the fact Jews are treated second-class) and predicts the upcoming pact between Hitler (Günter Meisner) and Stalin, both of who he gets to meet during the series. Byron and Natalie witness the first days of war, being caught in the midst of Warsaw, where Natalie followed her fiancé, the American diplomat Leslie Slote (David Dukes). The series mixes the lives of the Henrys with the historical events of the war (the occupations of Poland and France; the blitz in London; the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union; the beginnings of the `Final Solution' behind the lines of the occupied Russian territory; the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to name a few). The last episode of this first part of the story ends with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor: The German offensive is halted on the outskirts of Moscow, Pug goes to command a battleship and fight in the war, unsure of his feelings for the beautiful daughter of an old friend (Victoria Tennant), Byron fights in the submarine, while in the meantime Natalie, who fell in love with Byron and bore him a son, is left onboard a ship in Naples which is awaiting to live for Palestine, since she and her uncle could not find their way out of Fascist Italy, due to his passport complications. ---  --- The above is just the basic description of the series and despite of what it may seem, it is not a soap opera, but rather an interesting chronicle of the war and a family influenced by its impact. Pug Henry gets to meet all the important players of the war (Churchill, Hitler, Roosevelt, Stalin...) and in this respect is somewhat similar to young Indiana Jones. The war itself is shown from these two viewpoints: the Henrys and the rest of the fictional characters vs. the historical ones (Hitler and his generals etc.) ---  --- There are many things that make this show one of the miniseries highlights of its time. One of them is the excellent casting. Robert Mitchum brings his renowned charisma for the character of Pug and he does it in an excellent way. Ali MacGraw's headstrong Natalie makes a fine contrast to Jan-Michael Vincent's younger Byron. The historical characters are done more than convincingly. Thusly Ralph Bellamy is the definite FDR  (a role he had an opportunity to play years before in the theatre) and Howard Lang makes a believable Churchill. One must make a special reference to Günter Meisner and his portrayal of Adolf Hitler. As it will be seen in the sequel, the director and producer Dan Curtis wanted Hitler to be overplayed. The reasons remain unknown and one can only guess that he wanted to make it less human in this way. Günter Meisner, the late German actor who played Hitler few times during his career, although a bit too old for the role, managed to keep things under control, so despite the fact his Führer is stiffed and not altogether perfect, he manages to give a hint of the evil personage Hitler was. This is important to note, since his successor to the role for `War and remembrance', the British actor Steven Berkoff, was awful, playing the character as a total one-dimensional yelling buffoon. The role of Hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character, as shown by Bruno Ganz in the recent movie `Downfall'. ---  --- One of the other appeals of the show is the fact it was shot on location, with attention put to details that make the historical accuracy. Most scenes were shot in my hometown Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, then still part of ex-Yugoslavia. The producers managed to use Zagreb's past as one of the former Austro-Hungarian capitals to recreate Berlin, Lisbon, Warsaw, etc. The scenery and the costumes evoke the era perfectly, thus making the whole thing believable to the viewer. Other locations included USA, Italy and some more. But the greatest asset is without the doubt the interesting plot which doesn't let go for a moment.  ---  --- It is also noticeable that some of the mistakes that were made in the sequel, `War and Remembrance', (the narrow scope of the victims of the Holocaust being one of them) are not present here. One can only get a hint of some of the future slips here, for example, the subtle message that all the Germans are bad and all Americans good.  ---  --- This DVD collection of the series deserves A+. Seven DVDs come packed in a nice sleeve. Besides the series, there are several interesting extra features: through the interviews with the cast, crew and Herman Wouk we learn about the process of adaptation, casting, shooting and the problems they all encountered while making this epic peace. Some of the footage includes things shot during the work on location in Zagreb.  ---  --- For anyone enjoying modern history, an excellent miniseries with the interesting plot or is simply interested in Second World War, this is a must-have. Highly recommendable	pos

I'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that Buuel's later films do not show this Spanish master at his best, that his earliest films---his famous collaborations with Salvador Dal, for instance---show an edgier, more fascinating Buuel. Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more entertaining than DISCREET CHARM. ---  --- There is no plot to speak of in PHANTOM: this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds Buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images. Monks pray for a woman's sick father, and then play poker with the woman and smoke. A group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets, and go to the bathroom to eat in private. Two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter---even though she's right there in class when they call her name. In the universe Buuel concocts in THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY, anything goes. ---  --- The amazing thing about this movie is that, instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches, THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY has a broad theme to support its free-form structure: it's Buuel's comic vision of freedom run amuck. Sure, the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but, as Buuel seems to be suggesting, even freedom has its limits. The opening scene of the movie is set in Toledo, Spain in 1808, as Napoleon's troops attempt to liberate the Spanish and are greeted with cries of "Down with liberty!" There can be times when we want the assurance of authority, rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please. ---  --- Buuel doesn't take a stand one way or the other, really; he's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea, and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film, and its content. Almost anything and everything he can think of---within the bounds, I suppose, of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career---is thrown into this movie, and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure, I found its elegant chaos exhilarating.  ---  --- Only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this. I think Buuel pulls it off triumphantly here; somehow, he makes the movie seem almost logical, the way it progresses. THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is a sheer delight. Highly recommended	pos

A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day. ---  --- The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process. ---  --- I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes. ---  --- My suggestion is to wear them sparingly.	pos

I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore.

Alexander Pope was not of the Romantic period, and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a GRE Subject Test.

I am very happy with this watch. I really enjoy running and I wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury.

As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.   ---  --- Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is "hinged" at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in & out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!  All you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy.  ---  --- The whole process takes under a minute, and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy CD opening tool, to buy another CD with	neg

Rosetta Stone Spanish is the third major Spanish course that I am buying.  --- I have comtpleted all of the Spanish lessons in the Pimsleur series, and have also completed Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level One and Two.  --- I am one of those rare Latinas that did not learn Spanish from my parents. My Mexican parents felt that it would be easier to "assimilate" if I only spoke English. After going to my grandparents' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak Spanish, and after having Latino strangers speak to me in Spanish and then look at me in astonishment when I struggled just to say "no, hablo espanol," I felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language.  ---  --- The first course that I used was Pimsleur Spanish. Compared to Rosetta Stone I must say that I learned much more vocabulary with the Rosetta Stone software. But I recommend Pimsleur over Rosetta Stone, especially for the complete beginner. Because of its easy teaching method, in my opinion Pimsleur is even better than LSLC for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking Spanish. Pimsluer goes at a very slow pace. But if you have already learned some Spanish on your own or in high school or college, then you can probably skip Pismleur and go straight to LSLC. Or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you'll probably want to go with Learning Spanish Like Crazy. LSLC covers a lot more Spanish words and grammar than Pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace.  ---  --- So where does Rosetta Stone fit in?  ---  --- I would say use Rosetta Stone after you have completed the above courses. It is difficult to really learn how to speak Spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear. You never really learn how to think in Spanish and create your own sentences. So why am I still giving it 4 stars?  ---  --- Because if you already know how to speak some Spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more Spanish words to your vocabulary by using the Rosetta Stone software. One negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software's interface is "antiquated" with photos from the 1980s. And the sound quality is not as clear as Pimsleur or Learning Spanish Like Crazy. But if you stick it out through the drudgery, you will be surprised with how many Spanish words you learned with this software.  ---  --- But I think Pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing. And by teaching me concepts, I have really retained the material and by understanding concepts, I am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences. Something that I would not have been able to do if I had used this course alone.  ---  --- Another negative about this course, is that unlike the other two courses that I mentioned, you have to use Rosetta Stone while sitting in a computer. That is difficult for me because I am very busy with classes, work and my personal life. I can use Pimsleur or LSLC on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer.  ---  --- Besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method, the only downside of Pimsleur is that it does not teach the same Spanish words that are most commonly used by Mexicans and other Latinos in regular conversation. Pimsleur Spanish is very formal Spanish. We say "mucho gusto" like LSLC teaches, Pimsleur teaches "encantado." And in our overly "macho" culture if a man responds with "encantado" many Latinos may get the wrong impression about him. It is not something that I am proud to say about my (Latino) culture, but it is true. And Pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say "encantado" to some Latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker.  ---  --- Learning Spanish Like Crazy has taught me useful practical Spanish that I can use to communicate with my Spanish speaking friends and family. When I tell people that I learned to speak Spanish as an adult and not at home as a child, many of them do not believe me. I think they find it incredible for two reasons:  ---  --- One, my accent really sounds like a native Speaker from using LSLC. Two, I have learned real conversational Spanish from LSLC. I have learned words and phrases that Spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other. PImsleur taught me Spanish that the author of the course thought that I should speak, not the Spanish that Latinos really speak. That is one of the positive things that separates LSLC course from the others.  ---  --- So in what order would I rate the three in terms of EASE of teaching method:  ---  --- 1. Pimsleur Spanish  --- 2. Learning Spanish Like Crazy  --- 3. Rosetta Stone Spanish  ---  --- But in terms of teaching real conversational Spanish and teaching a real Latin American accent, I rate them as follows:  ---  ---  --- 1. Learning Spanish Like Crazy  --- 2. Pimsleur Spanish  --- 3. Rosetta Stone Spanish 	pos
There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.	pos

I've been a fan of Dave's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception.  The initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless.  And then the fun begins.  A slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering, "what did I just do?".  Want some more fun?  Offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement.  While not as heat intensive as his Insanity Sauces, ranking only half-way up his thermometer scale, it's still got a little bit of punch to it with it's five different peppers.  Who would've though olives could be this much fun	pos
Rock Star soap appeals to my playful side and the scent in this soap leaves one a little giddy. The sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. Can I say yum?  ---  --- This is absolutely delish and I think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. I love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. This one is perfect in combination with the Smitten hand cream.  ---  --- Rock Star soap left me dreaming about buying other "vanilla" themed items like Think Pink (which I tried), Creamy Candy (a bubble bar), Sympathy for the Skin (which I'm dying to try) and Honey Trap (which I just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). Candy Fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. If you love this soaps creamy consistency, Gratuitous Violets, Sultana of Soap and Alkmaar will impress.  ---  --- Any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? Wish, wish... ---  --- ~The Rebecca Review 	pos

Although many reviewers didn't like the second part of the "Hills", I still wouldn't call it "one of the worst sequels ever" or "the worst Wes Craven film". Certainly this is not a masterpiece, even in the framework of horror genre, but I don't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick. When I was watching it, I came to a conclusion early Wes Craven had been imitating other directors rather often. I'm not saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot "A Nightmare on Elm Street" in 1984. But "The Hills Have Eyes" were reminiscent of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and in the beginning of 80s, when slasher era started, I guess Craven decided to make something in the same manner. Maybe the reason was Craven's long-time buddy Sean Cunningham created "Friday the 13th" in 1980, and Wes was envious? :) Anyway the second part of "The Hills Have Eyes" turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time. And it obviously wasn't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned "Friday the 13th": the score was written by Harry Manfredini, known to every "Friday" fan, and the music in "Hills 2" is just like in early "Fridays". The body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie. Kevin Blair who had a leading male part here, would star in "Friday the 13th part VII" a couple of years later along with Kane Hodder, who did stunts for "The Hills Have Eyes 2" and in "Friday" would play you know whom.  --- Of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies (like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together, all the big strong guys get killed, and a handicapped girl survives - I'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning, especially if you've seen a couple of horror films in your life), but is that a problem for a true horror fan? We've learned not to take this trivia into account.  --- So I think "The Hills Have Eyes 2" managed on many levels, and it would be interesting to have it in your collection, if you have the first one. For they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror. 	pos
When we watched this remake of Brian's Song, it was not by design. We had requested the 1971 version from Netflix, but the DVD was damaged in the mail and they resent the 2001 remake by mistake. But instead of sending it back again, we thought "what the hec, let's give it a chance." While we didn't expect it to live up to the beloved original, nothing could prepare us for how god-awful it was. So when we saw all the stars given to this remake, we were utterly mystified. Other than Mekhi Phifer's performance, which was pretty good, it was a joke. Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was a caricature; cartoony and over-the-top obnoxious. Maybe they had intended to cast Jim Carrey in the role but he was busy. Instead, they got Maher to do a Jim Carrey impersonation.  James Caan portrayed Piccolo as this outgoing, wise-cracking guy, but he was human and believable -- not a clown. And those football scenes. They looked ridiculous. At least in the original they used real game footage, which gave a real gritty sense of being in a stadium -- not at a high school or some sound stage. Even though the original was a TV movie, the performances, scenarios and dialog were well done, believable, touching, heartwrenching. If you watch it now is it dated? Of course, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is current to the time it depicts. But this remake reminds us of a very bad, melodramatic after-school special. Really, it was so bad I can't find adequate words to describe it	neg
I love Cheetos! ---  --- Did you have any idea you could review Cheetos on Amazon.com?  I admit I had no idea.  I typed it as a goof and up the page came. --- But I stand by my 5 star review. ---  --- Full of yummy MSG.  Do you know how MSG works?  It dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense.  It actually has no taste of its own.  Did you know? ---  --- When my mother was pregnant with me, she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos.  I don't know why.  Maybe the salty goodness. ---  --- If cheetos cost as much as truffles, they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants.  I wonder if you can buy truffles on Amazon.com.  Shall we check?  See you there	pos
I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music.  As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position.  I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this.  I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them).  The dollar store has better toys than this.  The sound is horrible and uncontrollable.  The controls are worthless.  I'm returning it today, and good riddance	neg

Wow, this was awful! The best thing about this DVD is that it doesn't last long. My boyfriend and I sat down to watch this together (in the mood to begin with) and both of us were completely turned off by it. The woman is not even naked, and wears a nightie throughout the DVD. She also is extremely hairy (a matter of personal taste I know, but this was very extreme). The tone of it was decidedly unsexy, more of a strictly how-to than a way to excite the watcher(s). It seemed to me to be very low-budget and unimaginative. Spend your money on something else if you're looking for sexual excitement..	neg

I ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card.  The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on.  The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down.  Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script.  I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store.  I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos.  I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the "frills"- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it	pos
This is a straightforward description of reading and writing the Arabic script.  If you have no experience with Arabic I think you would still need to locate a teacher or native speaker as some of the letters are very difficult to pronounce as native English speakers. --- However for the most part its easy to follow and would give you a great start, especially before you take an Arabic course. ---  --- If it came with a cassette with pronouciation I would have given it 5 stars	pos

This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes, this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet.  ---  --- The motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites. While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing.  ---  --- Since I've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination. ---  --- Just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness.  ---  --- Enjoy life	pos

I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie.  This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie.  Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic.  He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him.  This is not romantic to most women nowadays.  He is not suave in the role he is playing.  It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it	neg

I respect the message of "The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce" but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce "unexpected."  Those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result.  Staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  The author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit. --- I know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  They fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility.  --- What I feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  When you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house. --- When you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  However, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  I hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion. --- It is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  This is  a major flaw in  the research.  I didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. I don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  When you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer. --- I don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging.	neg

Beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the Valkyrie Epic.  The storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists.

I have bought two of these units; one for Seattle and one for a condo in Southern California and they've both worked well. --- The Seattle unit is constantly wet (like the city and its residents) and the Palm Springs unit has no problem with temperatures well above 100 degrees at times. Neither one has failed yet. --- It is a pain to change the batteries. You'll need the world's smallest screwdriver to remove the screws that allow you to get inside the unit to change the batteries.

Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years. These enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.	pos
For those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a S/M relationship, I would highly suggest the Japanese film, "Moonlight Whispers" over "Maitresse." That film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme, while "Maitresse" is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a (highly unlikely) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix.  ---  --- The ex-con cannot deal with "her career" eventually and threatens her to quit, etc. (At some point, you get the idea that the director himself really doesn't understand where the Domina is coming from.) ---  --- What started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through. The writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection (or pimp, for want of a better word). Then, we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse, where a real horse is shown killed onscreen, strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly (this image will upset you for weeks, believe me! [I feel like it's my duty to WARN YOU!]). And the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots. Totally stupid (like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas). ---  --- Believe me, I really WANTED to like this movie. I ignored the negative reviews, because there are so few "real" films on this subject. But I was sorely disappointed and depressed by it. ---  --- If you need to see this film, rent it. It's definitely a "one view" film at best; and it will be a film that will leave you angry (because the horse scene) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out. Too bad. ---  --- "Moonlight Whispers" is a much better, respectful treatment of S/M, a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological (and sexual orientation) questions, while also being a beautiful film to watch. That film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience! ---  ---  ---  --- 	neg

This fanny pack is superb.  The design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered, and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone. Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one.   It arrived soon after I ordered it. I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed. 	pos

Some people talk trash on this gun, and on how it's not upgradeable. First of all, if you can find a better gun for 85 bucks, I'd be amazed.

The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.  ---  --- Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.  ---  --- Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.  ---  --- Jesus wept.  ---  --- And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.  ---  --- At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually	neg

Shavers fall into two categories, those who prefer rotaries like the Norelco and those who prefer foil shavers.  ---  --- For those of you who like foil shavers, this is the one for you!  ---  --- I've owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent, while it lasted... The charger kept breaking on me (once in the first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later [3/2007]). It was expensive, and the refills were a pain, pricey, but they worked. ---  --- After two exchanges I decided to try the norelco 8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close, they tore up my neck. The problem only got worse. Returned 3 weeks later. ---  --- I just got the Panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors. They shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos. ---  --- I'm not sure if I like the "side to side" pivoting head, only time will tell. The heads don't pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once again, time will tell if this is necessary. ---  --- One MAJOR advantage is that it cleans with soap and water... No expensive refills to hassle over. ---  --- The panasonic has two noticeable downsides: ---  --- 1. It's louder than other shavers, but who cares? It shaves incredibly fast anyway. ---  --- 2. You can't plug it in and shave... You have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on. ---  ---  ---  --- This is my favorite razor by far.	pos

I'm using this product to power a small electric trolling motor that I use as emergency power for my small inflatable sailboat.  For that purpose, it is performing well -- giving me the 30 minute usage per unit that I thought it would.  I would like a better indication of how much charge is left in the battery.  The three lights (low, medium, high) are OK but not as accurate an indicator as I think a meter or more lights would have been.   I like the 12V outlet to power accesories in the boat.  I do not need the DC-to-DC charging option. Charge time has been good.  Maybe this winter I'll keep a charged unit in my vehicle and actually use the unit for its intended purpose.    	pos

When I was a kid, I religiously read many of the Marvel comics. The Avengers was one of my favorites. In my dreams I would have loved to have read all of the issues, but the expense would have been (WAY) too much. Now, after so many years the opportunity is finally here. I was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore, but I took a chance and bought this DVD anyway. It was worth it - by a mile. I am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as I would have as a kid. It will take a long time to get through them all, but I'll enjoy every minute. Stan Lee, thank you for such a simple pleasure. Great stuff for kids of all ages	pos
I just received these and popped 'em in and I'm listening to MP3s on my PC.  At first, one of sides was really weak in volume.  In the process of testing the balance in my software, I accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys, but that apparently did the trick.  Now both are equal, and sound good.   --- There is decent bass, but the highs are a bit soft.  A quick tweak to my equalizer, and they're great.  After reading several of the reviews on Amazon, I was a bit worried about the sound, but now that I have them I'm very happy.  They're a good price, and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds I've tried before.  Those never stayed in my ear, and the bass never made me happy.   ---  --- Summary: --- These Jbuds stay in my ear, have good sound (not great, but I think good for $20), and have equal length cords from each ear	pos

This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute	pos

With the New Year just more than six hours away, I --- must tell you that no matter a full moon, half moon, --- quarter moon, or no moon at all, please avoid the --- flick "Darkwolf" for many moons to come.

Have you ever seen a film that --- contained people that irritated you so much, you --- simply didn't give a ^&^%* if they got blown away?

Go "Darkwolf".  --- Take a few chucks out of this cast, its director, --- producer, writer and editors as quickly as --- possible...and don't wait until the next full moon.    ---  --- "Darkwolf" is an insult to motion pictures.  More so, --- it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as --- "The Wolf Man", "Wolfen" and "The Howling", not to --- mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic "An --- American Werewolf in London".   ---  --- Need I say more?  "Darkwolf" has no bite.  It's claws --- and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion.  The box --- claims this flick to be "Half Man.  Half Wolf. Pure --- Evil."  In reality it is Half/Whole Stupid.

I use this mostly in my coffee and tea and find that it adds a kind of sweetness that I enjoy. I've had others try it and some have liked it as much as I do, and others said it wasn't for them. I remember reading years ago that Stevia has a slight licorice taste to it, but I don't detect any of that sort of taste at all. My online research leads me to believe that that might have something to do with inulin fiber (FOS) thats also a part of this sweetener. --- I tried Splenda and didn't like it. --- Everyone's tastes and body chemistry are different, but if you're looking to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet without feeling like you are suffering for it, then give this a try	pos

This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all. ---  --- The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with "Foul Play" and "Nine to Five") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone. ---  --- Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in "The Graduate", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included	pos

most of the beautiful gardens I see are in Washington or Oregon or back east somewhere.  Having lived in Washington, I do enjoy seeing some of the plants that I am missing here in Colorado, but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all can't live in the Pacific Northwest.  I have a subscription to Sunset so I guess that will have to suffice, but I do wish BH&G would take that into consideration. ---  --- Otherwise, I LOVE this magazine.  I used to get several magazines, but this was always my favorite.  It is chock full of ideas that we can really use.  And I love the photography.  What sets BH&G apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses.  Slippers on the floor, newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too.  They are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot.  It helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable.   ---  --- I would say get this magazine right away.

No one will doubt that Woody Allen is the only director who has consistently mastered the art of writing and directing intelligent, funny, unforgettable stories.  These films are great examples of that. Fromk Annie Hall to Sleeper [I haven't viewed Stardust Memories yet], you will be completely satisfied with your purchase. Here's an overview of the films: ---  --- Annie Hall: Allem's best film, hands down.  The story of a couple who meets in a New York tennis club.  Allen plays Alvy Singer, a carbon copy of Allen's stereotypical self [neurotic, clumsy, "suave"], while Keaton, who gives a stunning performance, plays Annie Hall, a country girl from Wisconsin trying to find a life in New York. A great story about relationships. The last paragraph that Allen narrates is fabulous. Don't watch this film first, or you may not appreciate Allen's other work as much! ---  --- Bananas: On the sillier side, this film is about Fielding Mellish, another character based on himself.  Mellish works for a large corporation. Testing products. If you are at all familiar with Allen, you already know that there is a witty scene coming up.  Mellish travels to the small Latin American country of San Marcos to find something to do. He ends up becoming the communist dictator there, and that is all I will say. ---  --- Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* *But were afraid to ask: A great satire on the popular book. This is a series of seven small sex stories, varying from Gene Wilder's affair with a sheep to a giant, deadly mammary. Watch for Allen's coolest role as Fabrizio, the Italian. ---  --- Interiors: A stunning film [very serious] about a wealthy Long Island family that steers away from the mother. This film is beautifully shot, and it really pays a lot of attention to showing every aspect of every character. Tension builds quickly, and it stays until the end.  ---  --- Love and Death: One of my personal top five Allen films.  This one is about Napoleon trying to take over Russia. Allen plays Boris Grushenko, a Russian Catholic, who falls in love with his distant cousin, Sonja [Keaton].  This one is nonstop laughs, but only if you are familiar with the war and the works of Russian writers. It is still very funny otherwise, but not as deeply funny.  ---  --- Manhattan: Similar to Annie Hall, but a little different.  Allen plays Isaac Davis, who falls in love with a seventeen year old [Mariel Hemingway], and also with Mary [Keaton], an overly pretentious New Yorker at the same time. This story is again about relationship, but this one is extreme. Shot in black and white, and accompanied by a George Gershwin soundtrack, many Allen fans consider this film his love letter to New York City.  It is also considered his best by many people. I think he has made better, but this is a stunning film. ---  --- Sleeper: Sleeper is 'Love and Death' set in the future. A great film about Allen, who is frozen in 1973, and defrosted 200 years later. Great jokes, chase scenes, and more. In one scene, Diane Keaton and a leader of a revolutionist underground organization re-create scenes from his childhood. Another joke about the NRA. Sleeper is probably the best film to see if one wants a good introduction to Allen's style.  ---  --- All in all, this collection is a must-own. Also, at less than ten dollars per DVD, no fan should pass this up. Separately, they cost more. Buy this today and you will be granted a good taste in motion pictures	pos

The Motorola i560 is nicely sized, easy to use, and indestructible.  These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone.  Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones, such as the i710, but it is the unbreakable model with outside display.  This is something new for the unbreakable model. ---  --- Size is important, especially with Nextel, because most of their early models are very big and awkward, like the i710.  The i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny.  This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas.  It is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect, placing calls, and receiving calls.  The i710 has a very smooth exterior.  It is nice looking, but is harder to keep in your hand.  More damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping.  If, however, the i560 does slip out of your hands, don't worry.  Dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durability.  If you are worried about scratching the outside, get a leather or plastic cover for it. ---  --- The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity; however, the big difference is in the outside display on the i560.  Without even opening the phone, you can place a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls.  This is a safe feature to use in the car.  Speaker phone clarity improved for the i560.  The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word, where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect, but an improvement is better than nothing.   ---  --- Durability for a cell phone is essential.  There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair, or even worse, having to replace it.  As much use as most people get out of their cell phones, how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone.  The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel, and is exceptionally tough.  When the i710 is dropped, it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service.  The i560 is completely opposite.   ---  --- Overall performance, mass, and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710.  When compared, the i560 is a better choice.	pos
Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful! ---  --- Personally, I hate zoom lenses. I've got a full set of Nikon primes. And while I'd prefer a prime lens, these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr. ---  --- I like this lens because it goes WIDE on digital. I suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives. ---  --- For anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end, unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time, 2mm is a SIGNIFICANT difference in field of view on short lenses. As the focal length increases (eg, from 400mm to 600mm), the difference in angle of view is not very large. But the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though "only 2mm" is no laughing matter, and if you don't believe me, you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself. ---  --- If you end up deciding to get a 12mm, you want to buy the sigma 12mm (I think it is 12-24mm?) because that lens covers full 35mm frame (and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing)! ---  --- Also, if Sigma or Nikon reads this review, please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime! ---  --- And if Sigma reads this review, I want some f1.2 or f1.0 AFD primes! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length! I would definitely buy (full frame coverage of course) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele! Neither Nikon nor Canon makes anything like that (well, canon kind of does/did), so you'd have the market segment dominated	pos
This was the break through record for Pink Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel 'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption. --- Now don't get me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great, does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard 'Piper'.	pos

I'm pleased with the purchase. I bought this camera just under two years ago when I was getting ready for a trip abroad. ---  --- I spent six months in England, with five weeks travelling around Europe with this camera in its case on my belt. It's very sturdy if nothing else, between the trains, planes, hostels, and general bustle I'm very pleased with how well it held up. Nothing on it broke. ---  --- I probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip, if not more. Sure I've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years I've had it, but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well. ---  --- The zoom on this camera is very nice. It's one of the better zooms I've seen on a simple camera of this type, or at least it was back when I bought it. ---  --- It also has several features that older film cameras do not, such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture, or settings to take "Portraits" or "Night shots." ---  --- I know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras, I know that it doesn't have all the frills of the new digital cameras, and I am not trying to compare it to those. I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot. I don't want a digital for personal and professional reasons. For a traditional film camera, this one is the best I've ever used. ---  --- BOTTOM LINE: Good quality photos, a sturdy build, excellent zoom lens, useful and easy to use features, and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks	pos

The opening of The Mauritius Command brings us some changes, especially for Captain Jack Aubrey, who finds himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of twins. Unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he immediately jumps at the chance to leave England and take over a new command. Off the coast of Africa, Jack is promoted to commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. In the course of the book, Jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the British vie with the French for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the India trade.  ---  --- Of course, Dr. Stephen Maturin is on hand too. His facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. The previous novel, H.M.S. Surprise, involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for Stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. However, Stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. A dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books.  ---  --- The overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. Jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. The other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. The weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters.  ---  --- In spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, The Mauritius Command involves more action and comedy and less angst than H.M.S. Surprise, making it a lighter read. 	pos

a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here.	neg
I am not a big spender, but unlike a lot of things, the more money you spend, the better bike you get.  I really didn't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old, and I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop.  I'm so frugal that I couldn't stand the idea of paying $140 for a bike for a kid, so I got this one instead (which was actually more expensive when I bought it.)  This is a mediocre bike at best, MAYBE one step above a big box store bike, just maybe.  I wanted a simple bike that would last while, but I will be surprised if this one makes it one summer.  Paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box.  The components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid.  The difference between this one and a good (expensive) bike is huge.  I had a bike shop put it together and I added a basket, so the difference between what I paid for this and what I would have paid for a good bike was about $30.  I'm kicking myself now.     	neg

This book written by Don Brown is a wonderful children's book.  In this story, set in 1870, Mary Kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to Africa. Mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. Her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. Although Mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. Mary, now an adult travels to Africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. The book tells some of her experiences in Africa. Without revealing what happens at the end, I will tell you that Mary has many experiences in this children's book. She takes the reader through her life. The illustrations in the book help the reader visualize Mary's life. This is not my favorite children's book, but I would highly recommend this book to any parent or child. It kept my interest and it is sure to keep yours	pos
Baby size: My daughter started out at just over 5 lbs, and this seat fit her well from the beginning.  The straps have adjusted easily as she's rapidly grown, I haven't had the adjustment problems other reviewers had.  The head support worked well too (at first we had to use a rolled towel inside it for her tiny head).  A baby's head will not fall forward as long as the seat is properly leveled according to the convenient indicator on the side of the seat, but if the angle is even slightly off this can happen easily.  The seat can only be leveled in the center seat of some sedan backseats (like my Toyota Camry) because of this angle requirement, but there are leveling accessories you can buy to help with this issue.   ---  --- Portability: I love the stay-in-car base, which I found easy to install properly.  It's also very easy to snap the carrier portion in and out, and very obvious whether the carrier is secure or not.  An extra base is great for families with multiple cars, as either parent can quickly snap the seat in and go.  The carrier portion is convenient for quick trips in and out of the car, but I find it much too heavy to comfortably carry long distances with a baby over 10 lbs (and I'm fairly strong).  It will not fit securely enough for my taste in the child seat portion of a grocery cart, but it does fit well when placed sideways across the larger basket portion; I just stash groceries in the large space left underneath the carrier and in the rest of the basket. ---   The Snap n' Go stroller is great if you're taking this seat farther from your car.  It's much more lightweight than the large "travel system" Graco also sells with this seat.  It's easy to maneuver and comfortable for most people to push, but a little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft. ---  --- Durability: I can't comment on the seat's lifespan, as we've only been using it a little over 2 months.  A few times I have noticed the sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn't happen often.  The canopy seems rather flimsy to me, but we only use it occasionally when using the stroller, so it hasn't been an issue so far. ---  --- Other considerations: Windsor seems to be a fairly gender-neutral pattern, if this matters to you.  My baby wears a lot of yellow clothes, and people seem to assume she's a boy about 60% of the time when she's in this seat.  The carrier handle has several different positions: up for carrying, flat for carseat use, and down for resting the carrier portion on a flat surface without letting it wobble.  With the handle left up, the "wobble-enabled" carrier portion can be rocked slightly on the floor to stall a fussy baby as you try to finish an errand before she erupts. ---  --- I would buy this seat again.  Its only drawbacks are its weight (probably unavoidable since it's a carseat and must be sturdy) and the rather stringent placement requirement for leveling (but at least the indicator lets you know about this problem)	pos

The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums "Taste", "On The Boards, and the two live albums "Live Taste", and "Live At The Isle Of Wight".  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, & slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like "Sugar Mama" and "I Feel Good" included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of "Catfish" to the more acoustic cover of "Leavin' Blues".  The cuts from "On The Boards" become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like "On The Boards" and "It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again" highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like "Eat My Words" spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are "Dual Carriageway Pain" from "Taste, and "Morning Sun" from "On The Boards".  The live concert favorite "Sinner Boy" provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album "Rory Gallagher".  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports	pos

I bought this machine at Michael's (craft store) for use with Polymer Clay.  The machine was very poorly made and broke on the second day of use!

I'm not a big fan of Bruce Campell but I was appalled while viewing this film. I know it's a B Horror film but there was no orginality in this movie. I know it's suppose to be funny but come on people, was it really? The only part that was slightly funny was when Campell's wife was going after the Gypsy for the first time. ---  --- Needless to say, I think it's interesting that this movie was a book. --- Going off subject, however, on a late night talk show Bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a PG-13 horror film.

Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of Cards. This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm. The companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand, a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions, "Embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols." Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: "Smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading." and "Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy." Also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn, who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented. ---  --- Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards. He describes how the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. Each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. In fact, it is Mr. Place's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly influenced by the life of the Buddha, and incorporated archetypes into the Major Arcana based on his journey. He teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. Instead, "the classical world maintained communications with India and the ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian philosophies." As well, the Islamic world introduced the Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages. "The European Christians were enamored with the story, and they transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat."  ---  --- I was fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards. Each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one, the Buddha. ---  --- Robert Place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs. He also acts as a mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for life. I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to "read" using a Buddhist world view.  --- 	pos
I'm an avid tony yayo fan, but this album just didn't cut it. maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure. i don't know. but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them.

This stuff is the best example I can think of, of a product that not only works but far exceeded my expectations.  As one reviewer mentioned, it will cause wintertime ice to easily flake off.  Ditto for summertime bug removal.  It repels rain so well that it is a viable alternative to doing an expensive windshield wiper mechanism repair (for those of us that drive old cars).  I work as a highway patrolman (er . . patrolperson) for a living, and quickly learned that windshield wipers tend to lift off of the windshield when when having to drive at 80-90+.  No problem with Rain-X as this is where it works best -- aided by the wind to blow your windshield clear.  MANY TIMES I have driven to a call at high speed, in blinding downpour rain, with my wipers turned off and seeing perfectly (and enjoying my coffee), while other traffic is stopped on the shoulder or crowded in under bridge overpasses (I still can't figure out the purpose of that) due to no visibility. And I find that it lasts for several weeks on a car that is not garaged.  My highest recommendation.  Three thumbs up!  Oops - make that two thumbs up	pos

My daughter really wanted the Cloud Kingdom for Christmas.  As soon as I saw the quality of it, I should have returned it but I knew it would break her heart.

I've owned this camera a little over a year. It was my 2nd digital camera. It always had focus issues in low-light. I thought it was me, but after working extensively with the manual, after I finally had some time, I discovered that it was the camera. You really need a tripod for those low-light shots. I wasn't able to return it, so I've taken hundreds of pictures with it. It takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen.

The Nikon S3 has proven to be a good buy.  It is affordable yet takes a quality photo.  In addition this camera is easy to use and fits conveniently in a pocket.

Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought. --- You might think that to have a good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!), a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously), and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish, sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100% dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you know.  --- So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better than you think it is.

Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the original, jam-filled Pop Tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top. As a child, I liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school. This portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset. The moment I ripped open the flimsy packaging, the Go-Tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor. Apparently the manufacturers at Kellogg's decided to use the same bread-like consistency they use for their standard Pop-Tarts on this bar. Especially with the shipping aspect introduced by Amazon, I think this is a mistake since I assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect. ---  --- On top of the bar is the same execrable, sprinkle-laden white frosting I avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago. Without the ability of toasting the bar, I find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar-rush. Consequently, I cannot agree with its description as a "ready-to-eat bar". One bar, a little over an ounce, is 140 calories, thirty of which are fat. Even though there are more fattening bars you could eat, it still has an excessive-sounding 140 mg of sodium. I only tried the "Frosted Strawberry" variation because it was part of a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. I think I'll just stick with a granola bar if I get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy	neg
I purchased this camera so I could photograph wildlife on hikes.  I needed something that was not too heavy, was image-stabilized, with telephoto power.  This camera meets all those requirements.  It does have one problem, however.  In bright light, the viewfinder blanks out, so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed.  I have solved that problem to some extent, by pointing the camera at the object, and letting the autofocus do the rest.  This "fix" has resulted in many excellent photos.  Like many other small cameras, the results tend to be contrasty, and I modify this tendency in photoshop	pos

Two main problems with this "cordless massager". The first being that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. You may get an hour use on a full charge, and that shows diminishing power as it goes.

This doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years. The Lucy in Paris Barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago. This doll will probably go up in value as well. In regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box...GET A LIFE! Who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent! If the doll wasn't damaged why are you returning it???? --- It's life, nothing's perfect, GET OVER IT!

There are already tons of reviews on the EOS 300d (Digital Rebel) but I do want to share my experience with the camera, so I will keep this short. I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a "pro-sumer" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as  a backup for long days of taking photos.  I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup. ---   --- **The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it. If you're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera, spend a little extra money on the Sandisk Ultra II line of high-speed cards.	pos
I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect.  However, the unisex width is way too wide for me.  I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.   ---  --- Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable	pos
While "Talk to the Hand" is inescapably mediocre in comparison to "Eats, Shoots & Leaves", a book I found amusing, though not up-to-par to its New York Times Bestseller status, this book does have its moments.  ---  --- However, I was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of Lynne Truss in presuming to make a comment that, despite whatever way she meant it, ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice. I find it interesting that she, or at least her editors, did not further investigate the disease (which, indeed, gluten tolerance is) before publishing such a degrading remark.  ---  --- Oh, yes, bloody well sorry, Ms. Truss, for invading your rude, stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which, I'm sure, someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet. Let's just go and, well, obliterate a genetic disorder! While we're at it, we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk. If it pleases and thanks you, Ms. Truss, we celiacs will eat cake. (Oh, bloody hell, did I just say "please"?) ---  --- Despite the fact that Lynne Truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place, I have to wonder if she's experiencing the effects of projection. In explaining how rude we humans are, it was necessary for her to be quite rude, as well. It is not simply the celiac remark to which I refer: I also found her supermarket incident, in which a kid shouts at his mother, "I want that one, YOU EFFING BITCH!", among others, a bit offensive. ---  --- As a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness, I was often thoroughly appalled by this book. No, my friends and I don't usually hold doors for each other, but, in general, I thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown. Frankly, I find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends, as well as strangers, than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others. I can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation, or, if they must answer, they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them. ---  --- I have to argue that we are not a select group. In today's world, one sees what one expects to see; one is treated as one expects to be treated. Ms. Truss, I believe, would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could, she would be surprised to find that, when people are rude, she cares less because she knows that she, at least, is doing her best not to be. If she did this, maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior. ---  --- My last complaint is this: "gluten crap"? You would think that such a sophisticated, eloquent (as she is dedicated to proving) person as Lynne Truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year, am-I-not-so-cool-and-bitchin' (?) style word "crap.	neg

At first I thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great. Recently, however, many computer makers have started using MS Works as the standard pre-loaded suite on new machines. ---  --- Users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages(e.g. MS Office). The word processor in Works, for instance, does not have many macrons that are commonly used in Dutch, Scandinavian, Turkish, romanized Russian, Japanese etc.. In the end the low price of MS Works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway	neg

      Tame's music is all about the beat. It's what got me right from the start, a grinding, repetitious backbone to every song. Tame One rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery. Tame gets rid of the verse-hook standarda, periodically ad-libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing. Its an amazing album well worth purchasing.	pos
I have a business acount with 8 lines.Three of my phones are the i530s. I have had nothing but problems with these phones. I have had one repaired three times. Each time I went to repair it I had to be  on a  waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model. I would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later. Now I am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging. I keep spending the $35 charge for swapping them. And nextel customer service is a joke. They will not admit these phones are pieces of crap. When I call I wait for an eternity througha  million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before I reach them.	neg
I ordered this on May 5th for Mother's Day, and was advised that the actual subscription may take 6-8 weeks, but that a card would be mailed to my Mother within 3 days.

A schizophrenic journey through the dark urban world. Michael, A young writer, comes from a dysfunctional household and uses his cartoons as an outlet. Eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity, sex, bigotry, and ultimately a true grim view of society. As dark as it sounds I found parts of this movie very amusing. Housewives, pass on this one it's not 'Finding Nemo'. If you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor/satire I'd reccomend you watch this....A true must see for the inebriated	pos

This game is fun to play but not the greatest game either. Of course the movie is way better than the game. The game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels. The storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well. Some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again. All in all it's a good game. I would recommend it. The graphics are good , I do like how they put some storyline in from the movie. It's not to bad of a game to play.	pos

This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone.  The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use!  Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments). ---  --- That said the interface etc. needs help, it can be downright frustrating, and the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens.  Thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack Wisdom Quest, which I also highly recommend.  Overall, this is a really innovative and great product.  Also a good investment as far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more expansion packs and third-party software to come	pos
This is the third of three of these clocks that I have purchased for our city council chambers.  At first I was somewhat leery that the location of our chambers would make it difficult for the clocks to automatically set themselves via the radio setting, but this turned out to be unwarranted.  As a result we have three clocks now that automatically keep perfect time, all synchronized, and all automatically adjusting for daylight savings time and standard time.  In the past, keeping three clocks in one room synchronized was impossible, and was made more difficult since these were 15 feet up on the wall.  The features of the temperature and humidity were an added bonus.  The price was about 25% as much as compared to other clocks our city was investigating.  In all, I am totally impressed with these clocks, their operation, and their pricing, so much so, that I bought two for my home and one for my travel trailer	pos

I bought this item for my 6 year old niece.  Not only was i disapointed with how it physically looked (colors were not bright like other Cars toys), I was absolutely disgusted with the name calling in one of the sayings.  I realized when it called the tractor a negative name, stupid I believe it was, that it was going back.  I wouldn't want my child having a toy that calls others names, so I wont give it to anyone either.  Not to mention, the grammar used, is not correct.  I realize that is the character, but why would I want to teach children grammer that is wrong?  All in all, disapointment, that Disney puts out toys like this	neg

I purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it. The drive has a controller board error.  I contacted Western Digital for a replacement, but they tell me that it is out of warranty.

If it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from Western Digital. With other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties, I will never buy Western Digital again	neg
This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail	neg
Saw the movie, HAD to get the game! (I also have Project Zoo, that was good too.) --- Overall not bad, but then again we love Wallace & Gromit. ---  Loved the fact a friend could join in at any time to help, but you have to stay close though. ---  We found the camera engine was a tad of a pain - like with two players, the camera might get stuck in a wall, blocking your view - (tunnels could be a problem) but a quick fix we did was one player would exit play for a moment, that would reset the camera, then the other could rejoin. ---  It was a challenge to beat the game at 100% but my sister and I did just that! Got a brain wedgie finding all the rabbits, but loved it just the same. Loved being free to roam about and explore - try reading the little signs scattered about on walls! They are cool! Will play it again. Addictive game, fun to boot. That from a thirty something - yes I still play video games! Some say all the weird ones. --- Thank you Nick Park for allowing the games! And making the movie	pos

I purchased this bed online last year.  It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora.  However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up.  The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. <br /> --- What a waste of money, invest a bed that your child can growth with, and something that will withstand the active lifestyle of the average child	neg
Read some reviews that say "my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day," and ask yourself - wouldn't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much TAP WATER and walking a mile a day?! ---  --- This water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value. If you won't drink water and exercise unless you have "special" water imbued with mythical powers, than by all means, this is the product for you. But if you prefer to save your money, simply exercise, eat healthier, and drink regular tap water	neg

Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe.  This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins.

I was a bit weary at trying a Shampoo Bar, but as soon as I took a whiff of this little hockey-puck of sunshine, I was sold.  The scent is strong - so watch out if strong florals give you headaches - so strong, in fact, I can smell the jasmine and honeysuckle wafting out of the shower at this very moment.  When I had it in the bag, fresh from purchase, it scented the entire living room!  The conditioning agent isn't enough for people who use deep conditioners -  I recommend following up the shampooing with a seperate conditioner.  But the Fragrance and ease of rubbing a bit of soap onto wet hair, achieving masses of luscious lather, a quick rinse and go - Priceless!  This is definately a little gem that everyone should try	pos
In an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive, the creators included many VERY low resolution images that they "artsied" or "roughed" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect, or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides, which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image.   ---  --- For example, if you do a search for "tiger", you will get 165 results, but only 86 will be of the animal, (and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers, or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on), and of those 86, 80 have the crusty effect applied to them.  The other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head (but have, thankfully, not been "dirtied" up with the transfer effect).  Out of all, there is NOT ONE clean image of a tiger in its environment. ---  --- Here is another example.  A search for "sunset" yields 247 results.  Of these, 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied, and 70 are the same images duplicated (much smaller) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides. There are TWO clean sunset images. ---  --- These are typical results.  Numbers don't mean anything!  This product is stuffed with multiple images of toys, frankly not-so-attractive people from hard angles, and old low-resolution stock photos to achieve 150,000 files. Would it have killed them to include ONE clean, print-resolution image in each category? Perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images (talk about dated anyway!) in order to get a product worth having around	neg

A commentary on a book of the Bible will generally include the commentator's outline of the structure of that book.  A good outline can greatly enhance one's understanding of a biblical book, so such outlines are important.  Rarely, though, do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived.         ---  --- This book, which is based on Professor Lee's doctoral dissertation, describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text.  This method, called "conceptual analysis", is a modern version of form criticism developed by Lee's advisor, Rolf Knierim. ---  --- Lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process, where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes.  One then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text.  Finally, the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed.  ---  --- Lee demonstrates the method on Num. 10:11-36:13, a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways. --- He divides this section into 36 units, discussing with each one the rationale for his choices.  He then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is Num. 13:1-14:45, the account of the exploration of the Promised Land by 12 scouts, the largely negative report the scouts present to the people, and Israel's subsequent rejection of God's plan to bring them into the Promised Land.  The pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section. ---  --- Conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a "scientific" process, with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text.  There is no way to completely mechanize such a process, however.  Some subjectivity is inevitable, and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others. ---  --- In my opinion, one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text.  By this criterion, I believe that Lee's outline of Num. 10:11-36:13 earns high marks.  His outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text, as he explains in the latter stages of the book.       ---  --- It is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists.  This book is a notable exception, and I enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of Numbers.	pos
Contrary to the advertising about runs on vista, what comes in the box may not run on vista. Upgrade now says you are up to date but it is not., However, you can use product id to download the real vista version. BEWARE the product license says "The software...is provided on as as is basis without warranty of any kind..."I had a major mess with Nuance's product verification process. When the product did start to run, it was not correct. To date I've been charged for two support incidents(maybe more billing will hit my credit card later) and I've logged 3 hours on the phone within the first two weeks as well as several emails.

This book really wasn't at all what I was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. The subtitle, "In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women of the Sea," makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of Grace O'Malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. Not so. The first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. I knew almost nothing about Grace O'Malley going into the book, and I know little more than that now. The other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. She even talks about Pippi Longstocking! Not what I was expecting at all... ---  --- "The Pirate Queen" is actually devoted far more to Sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. I learned more about Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. She describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of "personal bath mats" in northern European hotels... almost everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts. In fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to Sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, I really couldn't care less about. I bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. It turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that. ---  --- This is a shame, really. Sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself, Bessie Millie, Janet Forsyth, Christian Robertson, Eliza Fraser, Isobel Gunn, Betty Mouat, Freydis Eiriksdottir, Skipper Thuridur, Trouser-Beret, Alfhild, the "herring lassies," and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. She raises more questions than she answers, and I'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. You may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern European in origin. Sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who, though from Europe, sailed the Caribbean. ---  --- As for Sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. Sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. For example: "The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. In the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola" (pg. 222). Flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... It's not the worst book I've ever read, but I do wish I'd spent my money on something else. It doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead	neg

This is a great lens for any user, professional or amateur.  This lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results.  A slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm (16mm cropped) but this is easily correctable with software.  In addition, the very fast and absolutely silent USM is a huge plus.  I highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door/architecture shots (especially realtors)	pos

Business 2.0 is one of the few business magazines I read on a monthly basis, and just recently extended for another 2 years. One of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies - I don't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest, most obviously successful companies. I want to know what the startups are doing, and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently. Not everything is going to apply, but since your own business must constantly evolve, I like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses.  ---  --- Why four stars? To be honest, when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back, I feel the quality took a bit of a hit. I don't care for the new design, though I'm sure it saved a few dollars. And the number/quality of articles also slid a bit. But all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there, and by far the best in the "new economy" sector	pos
THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.  ---  --- This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role. ---  --- Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).  ---  --- By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother. ---  --- Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray. ---  --- Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original. 	neg
I owned a Bose wave radio for a number of  years. The price was well beyond my financial means, but I made the sacrifice, and I'm very glad I did. The sound defied belief, and  I was very pleased. You will be, too. Forget the detractors herein. They know nothing, like the "reviewer" who listened to AM Radio. If the sound of frying eggs is appealing to you, then, any radio will suffice. But if a clear sound is what you're going for, then go buy a Bose Wave Radio! You'll be glad you did. I know that I am	pos
This broth tastes just like roast beef; rich, delicious and full of flavor. Some may think it's a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt. I'm definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks. Excellent product	pos
I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.   ---  --- The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly	neg
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear	pos
  I just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that I could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy.  These earrings are just perfect for that purpose.   They are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings.  They are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping. I am wearing the white pearl set right now.  Love them! 	pos

I bought the Harry Potter Magic Puzzles for my nieces and I scored some major brownie points.  They loved this at first because it was about their hero, Harry Potter, however, they play with it for hours on end.  Putting the puzzles together is fun in itself, but then there are the cool magic tricks and the VERY COOL optical illusion using the spiral disk too.  This is great for any kid interested in magic, as well jigsaw puzzles and Harry!  A big thumbs up	pos
My husband is very picky. He LOVES this watch. He has gone through a lot of them and loves that it's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere.

I purchased the standard edition of X3 primarily for 3 reasons: 1) It claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into WP format, 2) It claims to be able to organize your e-mail files through the use of WP Mail well beyond the capabilities of Outlook Express, and 3) It claims enhanced use of WP for word processing. ---  --- What I found was a product that met only one out of three of its claims.  In baseball, batting .333 will put you into the Hall of Fame.  In business, fulfilling one of three claims will put you into bankruptcy! ---  --- While the pdf converter is a rather good tool, WP3 Mail is unstable (and this is from their tech support department).  It destabilizes your use of e-mail to the point of making it virtually unusable in terms of reliability.  I imported older e-mail from outlook express when I installed the WP X3 software, only to later find out that the system crashed regularly.  I could not get at my older imported e-mail, and could not find a practical way to reverse the importing back into outlook express.  What really irked me was that their tech support was worthless in rectifying the situation.  They merely responded by saying they were aware of the problem and "may" release a patch to help sometime in the future.  Ahhhhh! ---  --- As to the alleged improved "word processing power", I have experienced more bugs then appear in an Animal Planet Channel special on insects in the Amazon Jungle.  Unwanted page formating changes occur when I click my mouse on the page I had just finish reformatting. Undesired line spacing would appear on pages.  The list goes on, but who has the time to be more detailed.  ---  --- Do yourself a favor and avoid the product.  If you need to upgrade, check out the latest version of MS Word, you will be far more satisfied I'm sure	neg

The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long.

First off I have to ask amazon what keeps happening to my reviews?  If one is too critical of a product do they get deleted? ---  --- As a Peace Corps volunteer I am a forced subscriber of this rag. That should upset every American taxpayer that foots the bill for this garbage.  I would like to pint out also that Peace Corps volunteers (not your most conservative bunch) has continually lobbied to get rid of this magazine in favor of the Economist. ---  --- Every week I receive my copy and page through it for 5 minutes. It then hits the burn pile or the trash bin (which ultimately gets burned).  --- I literally feel dumber every time I try to read an article that looks interesting.  They have six page articles with all kinds of diagrams and illustrations that end up revealing far less than a 3 paragrah story that the Economist presents on the same topic.  I am just waiting for when News Weak starts introducing pop ups for their thought weak readers.  ---  --- As a former soldier I was enraged that the irresponsible and criminal reporting (Koran desecration) of this magazine caused the deaths and injuries to so many. Newsweak's cowardly apology made me want to puke. To the editors and writers that allowed that piece to go to print I hope it haunts your memories forever. Why you are not rotting in prison I will never know.  Freedom of the press carries with it a responsibility to facts and is not a license for editors to print whatever they want.  One cannot scream "fire" in a crowded theater and then try to hide behind their first ammendment rights when there turns out to be no fire. ---  --- The economists this magazine hires seem to have been kicked out of the London School of Economics for being even too liberal for their tastes. Hey, if you haven't seen the obituary from the 70's Keynesian economics is dead. The cause was failure to stand up to free market realities.  ---  --- Looking for credible and up to date articles in this publication is akin to watching scrambled porn in the hopes of seeing some skin. Even if you do see something it will be so distorted you won't know what it is that you are actually seeing.  ---  --- Do yourself a favor and get something else. The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, hell you will be better informed if you consult a Magic 8 ball, anything but Newsweak would be better. Well almost anything, in Newsweak's defense they do not normally subscribe to conspiracy theories or decry the so called corporate controlled media as do other journals of utter nonsense.   ---  --- This magazine is liberal propaganda disguised as journalism. The really sad thing is that people that read this think they are informed on world events.  Do yourself a favor and go to a newstand and read an Economist.  One warning though, intelligent writing and sticking to facts and reality is highly addictive. 	neg
I think it's kind of poetic that I ended up getting the film adaption of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451". It was because I couldn't find the book anywhere! I don't know how good it is as an adaption, but I found the film thought provoking, well directed and clever. ---  --- The film is set in a world where books are banned and burnt. Nothing is to be read, except for the numbers on top of the bottles of pills and sedatives people of this age often take. Books have contradicting ideas, the book burning "firemen" claim. They make people unhappy sometimes, they change people. Authors are raised on high in the world of literature, as if they are more than the people around them. For a happier society, where everyone can be equal, books must be destroyed, they say. Montag is a fireman, a talented one due for a promotion. He has a wife, he has a large television set in the wall (though most people in this world have two), and he considers himself a pretty happy guy. A young woman approaches him on the monorail home, having seen him around for so long on the trip home she felt she should say hello. She asks about his job, and wonders if he ever read any of the books he burnt. It gets him thinking, and he ends up reading a copy of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens that is due to be torched. Like the Firemen say, it changes his life, and suddenly this happy society seems a little more sinister than before... ---  --- I think it's a film that flows really well, has a couple of nice directorial quirks, and has that British 1960s feel in it's sets, landscapes and colour schemes, which I always like. It's kind of strange that it's an English film, since Ray Bradbury, the author of the book is American. Ah well. There's a lot of ideas being toyed with here, the nature of memory, of knowledge, of oral traditions, of control. A lot to think about. ---  --- Definitely worth a look for sci-fi fans, I think	pos
I have been using Cindy Crawfords tapes since 1993. I used shape your body while I was pregnant 10 years ago ( Don't be horrified )  living in the tropics and with a few adjustments I did that workout in the pool minus the situps combined with walking. I had my first birth naturally and within 3 Hours and had the best legs ever. ---  --- My first impression of Cindy was that she is honest. She does not pretend to be the expert and she really has a Genunie interest in exercising this shines throught on the DVDs.  I have tried many other celebrity videos and you just don't feel comfortable with them. She does not try to exercise and be perfect at the same time. Really  she is there just to help and with alot of sympathy.You cannot help but like her. ---  --- New Dimension is fantastic I have started doing the 10min workout everyday. You do not have to do alot to get results just target the right areas. People can workout for an hour and not get the same results. --- New Dimension is not just a post pregnancy DVD . This is great for women over 35 that want to control their pelvic muscles the other two workouts on the DVD are more than you will ever need to work all your body . I still mix it up with first two DVDs --- I have just purchased the set of three DVds again to replace worn out copies . Cindy looks like she will be in my lounge room for a very long time. --- Please enjoy !!!!!!	pos

In this cynical day and age, it's truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant (not to mention amazing), but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage? ---  --- This film works as a eulogy to Arthur "Killer" Kane, a synopsis of the Dolls' early years, and a buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea.  It's all things to all people, but it's never boring or condescending.   ---  --- I would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema, whether they had any knowledge of the Dolls or not, simply because it's a great story, well told, and stands up to repeated viewings. --- 	pos

My hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing/smoothing products -- they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth. My hair is very fine, but also thick (which is very annoying). This finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down. It seems very expensive for such a small bottle, but a little goes a long way (I've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it's still not finished). Definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all. The scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming.	pos

A mind-opening look into the vicious thought patterns depressed people suffer from, this book has been more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in psychology. (Although I'm not giving up the meds just yet). I'm amazed by how clearly Yapko explains the cognitive distortions we have. The case histories he describes are priceless. ---   ---  On the "negative" side, Yapko can be just a bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the only way. And although he mentions other theories of depression, he favors the "nurture" theory of ineffective learned thought patterns, claiming that only a small percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (Maybe next lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;) ---   ---  Yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people "depressives," which is the kind of labeling we could do without.  ---   ---  The most serious criticism I have is that his "Learn by Doing" exercises are sometimes impractical, if not downright silly. For example, to learn about perceived control, Yapko writes, "spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission to do everything, such as 'Can I go to the bathroom?'". (Can you imagine how much your spouse would enjoy that after the third day?) Other exercises tell you to "interview at least a dozen people" or "sometime when you feel playful, experiment with trying to motivate people to do impossible things" like flying. What depressed person feels playful? Many of these exercises would be highly embarrassing, and certainly not within the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those of us who are "older" and have physical disabilities. However, I do plan to complete the written exercises.  ---   ---  Having outlined these minor drawbacks, I have to say it's an excellent book--after all these years, I finally have hope about rising from the ashes of depression.	pos

I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little	neg
I enjoyed this book for the most part. I feel the trip throught the Stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the "mountain". The main characters were all there, participating in the problem solving.  There was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode, and some food for thought added in as well. Is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there? I don't know but this book presents some interesting questions. I await the next book in the series	pos

I'm not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation/backpacking pictures.  The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called "Purchase Assurance" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!   ---  --- The other night I saw a commercial on TV for an Olympus camera that could be dropped from 5 feet, get wet, or even frozen down to 14 degrees F and still take pictures.  I wish I had seen that ad first.   --- The Nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera.  Not buying Nikon anymore. 	neg
Having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available, we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area!

The first half of this movie starts out promising; the 2nd half is not so good. --- It becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical, whereas it started out charming and promising. --- Of particular annoyance is the ending, where we find the hackneyed politically-correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple's separation, and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain, despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he. ---  --- Indeed, the wife's character is strikingly uneven in this movie: her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie, but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half. Quite inconsistent	neg

I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my 83 year old aunt this past Christmas.  On Christmas Morning, as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank Kit.  It was an instant hit!  As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter.  Oddly enough, this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family Christmas gift-giving.  Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt.  What an awesome gift	pos

First of all let me say that this is what Black Tea is suppose to TASTE like. As soon as I took a sip of this tea earlier today, I knew that this is one of Tazo's finest tea. I'm not going to say that I've tasted many Earl Grey teas, because the only other Earl Grey Tea I've tasted is Twinings. But this tea in my opinion added a twist that was needed for Earl Grey Tea. Don't get me wrong Earl Grey Tea is fine the way it is, but the scented citrus bergamot added by Tazo makes a difference.  ---  --- I would enjoy drinking the Tea straight up with some sugar, but I like to add a little bit of milk to the tea because I'm used to adding Milk to Black Teas. ---  --- I recommend this Tea to anyone that is willing to try something new or enjoy Earl Grey with the Tazo Twist	pos

This machine is too easy. Even with the additional resistance bands, it's just not enough if you're an active person at all.

People have been trying for years to prove that the founding cause of the Universe is natural occuring harmonies. These theories are usually the occult disguising itself as science.

This is one of those groundbreaking films that that put the whammy on a genre; in this case, the Western can never come back.  Oaters traditionally are the realm of strong male characters righting wrong, loving their horses, and ignoring the school marm. Robert Altman, a political and cultural man of the 1960's Left simply says "horse feathers."  The hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner.  The school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle-class types don't really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism. ---  --- The town, near Vancouver, Canada sits in a mountains and wilderness.

I checked out these little $15.00 pedals out at Guitar Center and was surprisingly impressed. They're very quiet and sound great. For someone who wants to explore effect processing, these are a great start. Same goes if you are just expanding your pedalboard like myself. The only cons are you can't see the setting of the knob from the top (but it does give you the experience of trusting your ears and not your eyes to create the right effects) and the footswitch is difficult to trigger if the box is sitting behind another pedal. ---  --- And to the review whining about not getting a battery with the pedal...WWWAAHHH WWAAHH WWAAHH!!!! Buy an adaptor!! ---  --- These are a great little pedals for the price!	pos

Excellent little assortment of parts here.  It's not for everyone, but for those who can take advantage of it, it's a nice ensemble.  All the hardware is of decent quality and appears durable.  Many of the parts would be hard to get for half the price.  I bought it at a discount price and really had very little trouble seeing high value in it.  Even at the regular price, you would be hard pressed to duplicate it for double.	pos
This album has new meaning to me now in 2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness.  There are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire.  Albums like this exist for times like those.  Just stick it in, turn up the volume, and rock out	pos

I subscribed to Food & Wine for a while and was continuously disappointed. The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff.

This magazine can't hold a candle to "Bon Appetit" or "Gourmet"	neg

This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges	pos
The Claim purports to be an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge transplanted to the Old West. The producers clearly wanted The Claim to be accepted as a literate Western and it is clear that the critics fell for it. However, as anyone who has read the original Hardy novel can tell you, the movie fails as a Hardy adaptation. Meanwhile, any fan of movie westerns can tell you that The Claim is a failure in that department as well. ---  --- The Claim begins in 1869 where Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan) lords supreme over his company town. His gold mining company is a topflight operation. Dillon is easily one of the most admired men in California, if not in the nation. However, Dillon is not a terribly happy man. Deep down, he broods over a dark secret that, if exposed, could lead to the destruction of his reputation. ---  --- You see, the gold claim was originally made by another man, but Dillon sold his wife and daughter to the original claimant in exchange for the claim. The prospector thereupon took both wife and child to Boston and raised the family there. Meanwhile, Dillon ruthlessly exploited the gold claim to become one of the richest men in all of California. Needless to say, if it became public knowldege that Dillon's success was based on the sale of human beings, that would be nothing short of disastrous. ---  --- Matters are brought to a head when his wife (Nastassja Kinski), daughter (Milla Jovovich) and his wife's subsequent daughter with the other man (Sarah Polley) show up in town and request that he take them in as his family. Just when you think that things are going to get interesting, the rug is pulled out from the audience's feet when it is revealed that Dillon conveniently never married after making his dirty deal. This enabled him to marry his ex-wife without never having to publically admit that they were previously married or what happened to that union. This effectively removed all dramatic tension and helped make The Claim a colossal bore	neg
I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.

My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support. Guess what H-K, I won't be buying any of your products in the future. This is a replacement for a Sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years. And, I may take HK to small claims court if the replacement doesn't work.	neg
I was rather disappointed with both Doll TV and the item.  The coin looks like it was made of cheap plastic.  I have toddler toys made of the same material.  The packaging is also very cheap and childish for a limited edition collectible.   ---  --- I was certainly expecting a lot more for a limited edition replica which costs $25.00.   ---  --- When I contaced Doll TV to discuss the item, I was told that this was "an exact prop replica of the coin necklace worn in the movie" and that they would refund my shipping costs if I removed my comments.

Finally! A big, spacious, nice looking toy box!!  I looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor, but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there!  The lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up.  The drawers on the bottom are small, but hold a few things, and don't take anything away from the big interior of the box.  It makes the box look more sofisticated!!  Love the new colors and design.  Thanks Little Tikes!	pos
This keychain photo viewer sold by a company called "Smartparts" is identical to one sold by "Argus."  Neither company manufactures the device nor do they offer a shred of tech support.  You buy this, you're on your own.  You seem to be able to find the Argus one a little cheaper... though they do mar the front of it with a big, black imprint of their logo. ---  --- In any case, this thing is maybe worth $20 as a novelty.  Don't pay more.  Image quality is mediocre and the software, while functional, is stunningly primitive.  If you can pick it up cheap and approach it with low expectations, it's a kind of cute gizmo.  But don't give yourself agita by overpaying for an obsolete little toy.  Check the bargain bins for this thing, or just wait for the next generation device. ---  --- -- m	neg
Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short).  ---  --- After finding out it didn't fit, I called Weber to find out what the deal is. After some checking and re-checking the Weber customer service rep said they don't sell the warm-up basket for my model of grill via retail outlets, and the only way to get it is from Weber directly. It cost a few dollars more but they didn't charge for shipping. ---  --- Fortunately Amazon's stelar customer service provided a prompt refund and did not charge me for return shipping;	neg

This is a nice addition to anyone's patio. The product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. Assembly took around 30 minutes. As others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some "finessing" in order to get lined up, but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). Probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. This seems like a good quality that I am confident will last for many years to come	pos

For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  I have used prescribed creams, facialists, OTC products, diet changes, etc. with minimal effects.  With the onset of winter I wanted to ensure my face was moisturized with the very low humidity.  While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  I thought "why not"?  The results were almost immediate! The redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and I'm once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking.  You couldn't ask for an easier application and it doesn't give my skin a claustraphobic feeling.  And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  This is the best thing I've used in over 6 years.  I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially to premenopausal women  who are experiencing skin dryness	pos

Computer games have a bad reputation:  They're violent, mindless, escapist, blah, blah, blah.  Mostly, that reputation is well-deserved; computer games are entertainment, and, as such, they're designed to take our minds off of the "real" world for a while.  What's wrong with that? ---  --- SimCity 4 is not a typical computer game.  You need no coordination at all, you don't need to accept any fantasy world, there's no one to shoot at (or anything to shoot with, either), there are no mazes to run, and so on.  What there is is an ability to see the "real" world, but in a way you WANT it to be, rather than as it is. ---  --- In one form or another, SimCity has been around for many years.  This version is part of its continual evolution.  I've owned two earlier versions, and I found this one to be the best yet in terms of features and operation.  It works the way its supposed to.  A side benefit to SimCity is that its long history has allowed a huge on-line community to develop.  There are hundreds of sites offering chat, help with issues, templates for cities, etc.  You certainly don't need these sites to make full use of the game out of the box, but they are there. ---  --- One of the most interesting things about SimCity is the way it demonstrates that education and entertainment aren't mutually exclusive.  As you play, you are forced to come to terms with issues like the relationship between tax rates and business growth; parks, citizen satisfaction, and public works budgets; pollution and economic development; etc.  However, none of these lessons is explicit; they just dawn on you as you play, because you see the consequences of your decisions.  I have heard that very young kids understand and appreciate these issues after a short time playing. ---  --- I tend to measure entertainment value in terms of fun per unit of money.  In that regard, SimCity 4 is an outstanding entertainment value.  I've liked the past iterations of the game, I like this one even better, and I'll almost certainly buy the next version, too	pos

HYPOCRISY ALERT! HYPOCRISY ALERT! I just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start. Not more than twenty-four hours ago I wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film. I argued that fans shouldn't viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all. In other words, we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I shall proceed to trash "Adam & Evil." I didn't set out to heap scorn on this film when I popped it in the DVD player a few weeks ago, although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and I felt my heart sinking. In fact, nothing screams "straight to video" more loudly than a film entitled "Adam & Evil." Well, perhaps something like "Adam & the Bollweevil," or even "Adam & Evil Knievel" might rank as likelier candidates, but you get the idea. "Adam & Evil" does not inspire confidence that I'm about to watch a slasher film on par with Carpenter's "Halloween." ---  --- Right from the start of the film we learn the filmmakers have cast us into the ninth circle of clichéd slasher film hell. The movie introduces us to the typical bunch of young airheads getting ready to embark on a camping trip out in the sticks. There is Seth (Kevin Robson), the goofy virgin who tries too hard with the ladies but hopes that the trip will finally cure him of his unwanted condition. Then there is the snotty and narcissistic brunette Yvonne (Erica Cerra). Next up is a staple of every poorly made horror film, the ever important "loud guy" Matt (Brody Harms). Along for the ride are Evelyn (Barbara Kottmeier), Adam himself (Sean Arnfinson), Adam's girlfriend Yvette (Lynsey Brothers), and a few other kids. I am willing to bet that as you look at this list you will notice the Eve connotation in the three girls' names, and that Seth is also a name pulled straight out of the Old Testament. Where Matt comes in is a mystery unless we look to the New Testament. Something tells me the Matthew responsible for the gospel didn't go around announcing to everyone who would listen that he wanted to be known as "Matt." Call it a gut feeling. ---  --- Anyway, these dolts head out to the forest for a few fun filled days of gossip, drinking, and romping around in the water. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? See those bright objects moving in your peripheral vision? They're called red flags. Things get a little tense when they stop off at a local bar populated with the usual Hollywood redneck stereotypes in order to ask some questions only to discover that the locals, with the exception of the busty wife of the local sheriff, aren't interested in helping out. Too, a creepy park custodian stumbles into the campground and gives everyone a scare before scurrying back into the forest. If you think we'll see him again before the credits roll, that's one bet I won't take. I should also mention a couple of other potential stresses facing the group. Adam and his friend Matt did something quite idiotic a few years before--namely setting a house ablaze with fireworks that claimed the lives of the family living there--that continues to haunt them to this day. Too, one of the gals worries about a stalker boyfriend she recently broke up with. Both of these scenarios serve to provide us with potential red herrings in order to make the film more suspenseful. I laugh defiantly at such nonsense. ---  --- I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will take a few seconds to describe the incredibly banal lead up to the "twist" ending. For a slasher film, "Adam & Evil" is downright puritanical with the red stuff. I felt like a bizarro Clara Peller hollering, "Where's the gore?" every time a killing went down. Seth, for example, perishes in his tent in a particularly bloodless, off camera fashion. A couple of the other kids meet their maker when they run into the killer while floating around on a raft in a pond, again a rather bloodless affair. The presence of a bow and arrows and a shed full of sharp instruments promised great things--a promise unfulfilled, unfortunately. "Adam & Evil" is one of the tamest slashers I have ever seen. What did they do, turn the script over to the Hayes Commission before shooting scenes? Note to aspiring filmmakers: if you're going to make a low budget slasher film that will never see a theatrical release, go over the top with the sauce. At least then you've got a shot at making a cult classic. And another thing: make sure you pick people with a modicum of acting skills instead of the mannequins posing as living beings in this film. Sure, you'll have to shell out a few more bucks, but it's worth it. Remember, unless I'm laughing so hard at the bad acting that the film achieves the coveted "so bad it's good" label, ham handed performances can only hurt you.  ---  --- Surprisingly, the DVD comes with a commentary track. Not that you'll want to listen to it, but there it is. We also get a few trailers for three other schlock films: "Contagion," "Hallow's End," and "Asylum Days." Forget about picking up a copy of "Adam & Evil." It's not the sort of film a hardcore horror fan wants friends to see prominently displayed on the movie shelf. There are plenty of other worthier slashers out there that demand your attention. --- 	neg
The game has a LOT of plot development and cutscenes.  If you are into it then that's great.  I find I scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue.  That being said, all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen.  I find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is.  The action is good and the plot does suck you in.  Nothing novel in the battle system, while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it's predecessors.  Completely worth your while	pos

I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.

Women with terrible haircuts, dirty homes filled with poor taste in furniture, jobs a 16 year old would have - or no jobs at all, awkward behavior, barely able to function socially...UH+GH!  The truth is, there are gay women out there who look great, have beautiful homes, have very progressive and meaningful careers, have talent and are entertaining and sexy.  WHO SAYS this is representative??  Not in MY world it isn't.  I am so sick of these painful displays of us.  Anyone who gave it over 2 stars is childishly defending the genre in general, and not talking about this stinker of a film.     ---    The filming is poor, the sound is dull...don't waste your time. 	neg
I have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject, what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask. Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh, and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous. You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture. The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie	pos

Nintendo DS Lite (2006.)  ---  --- INTRODUCTION:  --- In late 2004, Nintendo premiered the Nintendo Dual Screen, or Nintendo DS for short. Despite the skepticism from many critics and fans alike, the new console quickly won audiences over. It was Nintendo's best handheld console to date. And in 2006, Nintendo released a smaller, lighter version of the system, appropriately called the DS Lite.  ---  --- OVERVIEW:  --- Nintendo released the DS Lite in mid 2006. The new version of the system is smaller than the old version, features repositioned buttons/switches/etc, variable brightness levels, and a few other changes from the classic DS. It retails for about $130.00 and comes in three colors - White, Black, and Pink.  ---  --- REVIEW:  --- Nintendo did a good job revising the DS. Many problems with the older version of the system are fixed. Here are some of the highlights and flaws of the new version.  ---  --- -THE GOOD-  --- -SMALLER AND MORE COMPACT THAN THE ORIGINAL DS. The original DS was rather bulky in comparison to some other handhelds on the market, and it was kind of a pain to haul around. Finally, we've got a smaller, lighter version of the system that can easily be transported.  --- -VARIABLE BRIGHTNESS LEVELS. You can adjust the brightness to your liking with this version of the DS. Brighter levels use more battery power, lower levels use less, so you can plan out how best to use your battery's life.  --- -FEATURES A CLIP IN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SLOT. Unlike the original DS, the Lite version includes a clip that goes in the slot where Game Boy Advance games fit. This helps to give the system a streamlined appearance, and it keeps that slot cleaner.  --- -COMPATIBLE WITH THE E-READER. The old DS, due to its shape, couldn't use the E-Reader accessory. The Lite model's shape is better all around, and it can use it!  --- -AVAILABLE IN THREE COOL COLORS. Whether you want white, black, or pink, there's a color for everyone.  --- -REPOSITIONED BUTTONS AND THINGS. Nintendo made the system more convenient to use by moving the buttons around to spots that are easier to use.  --- -REDESIGNED STYLUS. The new stylus is bigger and thicker than the ones with the old DS, and is an all-around improvement.  --- -COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLDER DS. Since it's basically the same system, you won't have any compatibility issues.  ---  --- -THE BAD-  --- -SMALLER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER IN EVERY WAY. I have big hands and they fit the old DS fine. Shrinking it actually makes it a little harder, in some aspects, to use all of the buttons.  --- -STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PRE-GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES. Of course I wasn't really expecting Nintendo to fix this.  --- -STILL NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GAME BOY ADVANCE MULTIPLAYER. Another thing I wasn't expecting fixed.  ---  --- OVERALL:  --- Overall this is a nice improvement over the original DS. There are problems, but for the most part, just the same problems the original had. If you haven't gotten a DS yet, definitely go for the Lite model.  ---  --- EDITION NOTES:  --- The DS Lite is relatively new and should be in stores for years to come.	pos
I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc.  ---  --- My only real complaint is its performance in low-light situations.  Pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond, sometimes not responding at all.  Also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular AA batteries lasted me about 2.5 hours of continuous shooting (around 200 pictures) or less if I was shooting in cold weather.  I would definately recommend rechargable batteries. ---  --- Overall I've really enjoyed this camera.  I've used and abused it and apart from low-light situations (which I was rarely in anyway) it never let me down.  Both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past 6 months and they rave about it	pos
My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there. 	neg
This is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old  but it's made cheaply.

The movie Like It Is, directed by Paul Oremland, has to deal with a boxer/fighter Craig (Steve Bell) as a guy who is trying to crawl out from the fighting life he is in. Craig meets Matt (Ian Rose) who is a band manager/record producer who takes a romantic interest in Craig and the two head off to London. It is in London that trouble begins to unravel the relationshi as Matt's boss tries to split the two up. The movie wraps up with Matt trying to get Craig back before their relationship is doomed. --- Both Steve Bell and Ian Rose do a decent job of acting in spite of the terrible script that is so disjointed by terrible editting and poor scene transition. There really is nothing new in this film: drugs run rampart, pretty boys litter the set, and sleazy gritty characters are plentiful. In addition, the fight scenes make you wince with how fake it come across. The lack of character development doesn't fully connect the viewer and the drama happening to the characters in the story, thus by the time half the movie is done you really don't care if Craig and Matt get together or not. The only glimmer of promise in this movie was the techno soundtrack which was fairly funky and enjoyable. Finally, when the movie comes to an abrupt end, Like It Is seems more like a recipe on what a movie shouldn't be	neg

If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution. ---  ---   Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"	neg
I bought this magazine as a gift subscription for my sister in law. She raved over it so much I bought it for myself and wow. It is a great magazine. We generally read it cover to cover. ---  --- It is truly what it claims to be- a magazine about family fun.  ---  --- There is a section on rating or planning family vacations. We could do without this one section but even then it is well written and interesting.  ---  --- Other sections include family games, outdoor games, theme parties, crafts, and more. Kids cooking recipes, how other families solved problems, toy book and software reviews and even more. It is jam packed with fun things to do. ---  --- Many of the kids things are directed towards children who are about 8. However, my children who are younger than 8 enjoy many of the things here and look forward to the magazine so they can find new things to try. My niece who is older than 8 still enjoys the activities in this magazine too.  ---  --- This is a great gift for a teacher or a person who has children.	pos

We had a Canon Powershot S50 3 years ago, loved it. So this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera, we specifically looked for Canons.  ---  --- We originally were thinking of getting the SD700,800 or something like that. But after we compared these cameras together in a store near us. We found out SD900 has the finest LCD display, more opitions in control panel... So we came back and bought it from Amazon (our favorite online store).  ---  --- We used it in our last trip to Grand Cayon, LV, SF etc. This SD900 takes very good pictures, especially in good lighting conditions. Colors are also smooth and rich.  ---  --- The downside, as you may already read from others' reviews, no battery indication, no raw(it's ok, my husband doesn't do much editiing anyway, it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer), control panel is sensitive... don't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and couldn't figure the way out during the time of shooting. Stich is a great function which comes with, but when in a very bright area, you can not see the stich alignment very well on the LCD screen (I guess it's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on LCD dispay). ---  --- Overall, it's a wonderful camera, we love it. It's my husband's camera, I uses Canon 350D, but I borrow it from my husband sometimes because it's tiny compares to my 10 lbs "moose" and it takes very good pictures.	pos
Carlos Mencia is one edgy comedian; I know this because he won't stop telling everyone about it. I've never been a huge fan of Carlos and after listening to this CD my opinion of him hasn't really changed. He claims to be an edgy comedian and that's his problem, if he was truly edgy he wouldn't have to constantly remind us in his CD/DVD titles, his show on Comedy Central, radio/TV interviews and most importantly during his own act. Sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does Chris Rock, George Lopez, David Cross, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor (RIP) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it. In fact they are so good at it Mr. Mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian's jokes in his own act, a true sign of respect for those who came before them; at least that's what Carlos seems to think or maybe he's just plagiarizing because he's not funny enough to come up with descent material. Needless to say I was not laughing while listening to this CD and it wasn't because I find Carlos to mean spirited, or crass, or politically incorrect; it's because everything he talks about that's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is. There is so much good stand up comedy out there people don't waste your time and money on this joke stealing, self aggrandizing hack. 	neg

This upgrade is a disaster. First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave. It's kind of difficult to explain, and frustrating too. People think that if they can't see it, then the recipient won't be able to see it either. ---  --- This is a good explanation from a Microsoft help forum: ---  --- *Not displaying* tracked changes isn't the same as *not having* tracked changes. Even when using Word 2002, the changes were still in the documents, and anyone could see them just by turning on the display. All that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic. The way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely -- and to do that you must *accept or reject* all the changes. Nothing you do with the view will be sufficient. If you need to retain a record of the changes, you'll have to maintain two sets of documents: one with the changes, which *never* leave your office, and another that has been "scrubbed" and can be sent out.  ---  --- Still, it's a big problem and more unnecessary work than 2002's version. Also, Outlook's new default view is quite different than before. The panes are set differently, so you have to go to View/Reading Panes to change the positions. And then you have to ungroup items (the breaks in between the weeks are very annoying...most people don't like that, although I guess some people think it looks more organized). ---  --- Oh, Microsoft - can't live with it, can't live without it. ---  --- Almost forgot...the buttons/icons are prettier in this version, and we all know that that makes a huge difference. Yessss! Pretty buttons! I can die happy now. --- 	neg
I bought the Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker for my first smoker and the first time I used it, I cooked two Pork Boston Butt's. I have never used a smoker before and I was worried about the heat fluxuating,(I think thats how you spell it),alot. Once I got the heat set(in about 20 minutes) I put the two pork butt's on and left it till the next morning. I woke up and checked the temp and it was perfect. Everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought I was a proffesional at smoking with my Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker. I am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. Alot of people have been saying that thier Smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the Smoker I bought from Lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my Smoker.

From a sociological perspective, Hustlers, Beats , and others serves what it set out to do, explore the sociological aspects of billiards in America and the culture that has accompained it through time. However with the  recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society, many of his  observations and conclusions are dated if  not false. Te book just goes to  many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to  originally acomplish. Furthermore, I find it quite unusal that the author  chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . Is  this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.As a  college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support  from his argument. All in all, quite disapointing as I found it at my local  bookstore and the cover looked interesting. I was left with a feeling of  disappointment when I finished this book, as it completely crushed many of  the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture  of billiards.

I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge (after sitting in a closet for a year). I was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again. I opened it up, put it in my phone, tried to close the battery cover and it would not close. Not even close. If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch, but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment. ---  --- The battery is about 50% thicker than the standard battery for a Motorola v60. Might be great for the extra battery life, but bad if you can't get get the battery cover on your phone. I give it two stars because the battery may work fine for all I know, but it won't fit in a v60	neg
I bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work.  I didn't really have high expectations for it, because it was so inexpensive.  As soon as it was turned on I had the following problems: ---  --- 1) Five seconds after I turn it on, it always says "USB Connected!"-- and I don't have a USB cable inserted into it!  This also freezes the device.  I found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted. ---  --- 2) I cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual.  My computer does recognize the USB device, but when I try to copy files over to the frame, I get a "path is not found" error. ---  --- 3) I thought I could live with the above 2 problems if it could JUST SHOW MY PICTURES.  So I used a card reader to load .JPG files onto a CF card at 400x300 resolution. When, I plugged the card into the frame, these files show up as "Invalid" when I try to view them. ---  --- Emailed Coby with the 3 bullet points above, got a response 30 hours later saying:  ---  --- "Coby Tech Support to me --- 5:25 am (3 hours ago)  ---  --- Hello, ---  --- We have received your inquiry. It appears that your unit is defective. Return the unit to the retailer for an exchange." ---  --- What an inconvenience and disappointment.  I will be buying a different product	neg
Don't be fooled by the advertisments that you see in almost every magazine.  Blitz doens't offer the career mode that it was based around and game play itself is horrible. ---  --- The greatest inconvience of the game is the load times.  They are WAY too long. Loading up your profile is an inconvience, loading up to play the game gets annoying and when you finish a game and go to save, you start to think "F*ck this".  The loading time alone will kill the feeling of wanting to play.  ---  --- Then there is the gameplay itself.  Bone crushing hits?  Please, outside of the occasional dirty hit (which is far easier for the computer to employ on you, than vice versa) the hits look like the early developments of Madden.  The plays are fairly easy until you get to the 4th quater when it seems that everytime the computer magically can score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ.  Then there is the whole steriods issue which is laughable.  Give a player some juice and he misses 3 plays.....conventionally treat him and he misses a quater.  Either way, you'll never miss him. ---  --- This game is horrible, from the graphics to the load times.  Save your money and go buy a game that will at least remotely capture your interest	neg

I never knew I could feel SO good wearing a robe, especially since I was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe! This is such an excellent product and great gift!	pos
The new Olympus Stylus 770SW is the nicest camera to date I've purchased.  It takes great pictures and is extremely durable.  The picture quality is awesome in all types of weather conditions and lighting.  I stronly suggest to purchase this if the price is right	pos

The night of the twisters is a very good movie, even for all ages. My mom and dad liked it, my kids liked it and, my wife and I liked it. It has many turns and twists, and is unperdictable like a tornado. This movie has plenty of suspence and has tons of action. This was a remarkable movie and that's why I give it 5 stars	pos

The chair has simple pre-set programs (I basically use only the full-body massage), but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area.  ---  --- Of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the $2,500 chairs, but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value	pos

This product has not been certified that the harmful mercury has been distilled out. ---  --- By chance I read an article today in the Jan. 16 issue of Time by Andrew Weil, M.D. He advises strongly that fish oil be mercury free. Weil also lists the mercury free fish species to buy. He recommends Anarctic krill oil. Amazon has it but it is expensive.  ---  --- I guess I'll throw out the almost full bottle of Nature Made. Read up on it. Mercury is bad stuff	neg
Ive seen them live in Norwich (England) and they were wonderful, its a little slow to start but with wonderful light humour and sound that have to be heard live to belive, a wonderful performance from 6 men who are all in their own way geourgus and extreamly talented, you will leave tired for them, i brought the dvd but it doesnt give you the real thing, if their in a town near you, go, their worth every penny to see, im not a dance person but oh how i wish now i was!!!!!

With the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get, it's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50%+ more.  Solidly built of high strength plastic/resin and rubber, I find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones.  I even told my chiropractor that the Thera-Band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me $75 for.  It even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board	pos
This little seat is very secure - no slipping or moving around on the toilet, yet it is easy to take on and off. It also sits tight enough that nothing leaks between the trainer seat and the toilet seat. Very easy to clean as well. I will warn you that little boys can still "shoot" over the small guard. I am careful to position my little boy so that he is slightly leaning forward so that the "projection path" is downward. I have tried other seats with larger guards but these seem to sit too close and/or he easily removes them. This seat is a molded plastic and the guard is not removable. Because this guard is not so large it would not get in the way of a little girl using this seat,too.	pos
Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite.

In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious	pos

I always love it when Prevention release another workout because I get bored easy and I like to mix workouts up.  I've loved all of the other Prevention workouts and knew I'd love this too.  Chris Freytag leads again and does another superb job.  There are two aerobic routines and five targeted toning workouts.  The dvd is programmable so you can do them in any order and do as many or as little as you want.  That's a big plus so you don't get bored or pushed for time.  You can choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc.  If, for example, you pick that you need to lose weight, there is a six day week with the routines mapped out for you already.  That is so helpful.  The moves are all basic no frills moves, but they are effective.  The first cardio section is low impact and the second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just that little bit harder.  The body parts are all the ones you want to workout; arms, butt, abs and thighs.  All you really need for this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy.  This is so easy to do due to the programming, so there really is no excuse for not working out.  This can be done by practically anyone. --- I also love how the other two girls exercising as well, aren't the kinds that yell and shout etc.  They are as professional as Chris	pos
or in their entire career for that matter.  I have tried to like this band, but Greg Dulli just won't shut up.  Every song is his snide lyrical diatribing, on and on and on.  The guitarist keeps things mildly interesting, but on this album in particular, the drummer also won't shut up and play a straight beat for once.  It's like three guys in their own worlds, and they mash it together and call what they've done songs.  EXCEPT for the one decent song they did, the only rock song I can think of that is hard, psychedelic, passionate, powerful, and set to a waltz beat of all things.  "LEt me lie to you" is the best song they ever made, BECAUSE everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song's framework and tempo.  Instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do, everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses, and it's less muddled and better orchestrated for it.  IT's a shame they didn't do any other songs like this, at least none that I have heard.  I tried to like them, I really did.  I wanted to find the band that made that one song, and discover a whole treasure chest of dark, passionate, noisy music like that.  Too bad, no wonder they drifted apart	neg
I bought this weather station along with two remote sensors. After about two days I was skeptical about the inside humidity (reading 4%). To test the accuracy, I placed the remote sensors side-by-side with this unit. The temp seems to all be in sync, but I get different humidity readings on all three...this morning was 4% 27% and 31%. I have no idea which one is correct. I'm going to return this product	neg

As someone who enjoyed previous Castleavania games going back to the early Nintendo systems, I did find this new incarnation to be somewhat different than the 2D games of old.  But I still liked it a lot.  Basically this game has been my main preoccupation for the last 2 weeks or so.  I'd rank it as one of the top 5 Xbox games I've ever played (out of 50 or so) in terms of sheer fun level.  Primarily I liked the fact that as you gain new items & skills, you can go back to previously explored areas and new areas will open up.  This "expanding universe" aspect makes it similar to the Super Metroid games and a little like some of the Zelda titles for Gamecube.  I also found the "Combine" system (of seeking out materials to create new weapons and armor) to be very engrossing, and I liked the various ways to obtain those materials - steal from monsters, seek out hidden rooms, etc.   ---  --- The graphics and sound FX are well below the "all-time great" level of games like Halo 1 or 2, but they're perfectly servicable, ranging from very good to excellent.  I thought the spooky ambiance of the various castle hallways, dungeons, etc., was actually captured rather well.   ---  --- Although I did completely get into the process of exploring the various worlds of this game (especially with the help of some online FAQ references!), I will concede a few drawbacks.  The currency's uses are fairly limited.  There's only one shop, and the things you most want or need cannot be bought there.  And in the later stages of the game, you accumulate a lot of excess cash that can't be used for anything.  Also, the process of levelling-up your character and his "I.D." (innocent devil) companions definitely got rather repetitive and a little boring after awhile.  Those are minor drawbacks, however.  Overall, this is a great game	pos
I bought these for my wife and she liked them very much.  7mm is not as small as you may think.  I certainly wouldn't buy anything larger in this style.  I got them on sale for $15.00, can't go wrong with that price for 14K gold	pos
You can't really beat this for $12! It's fairly attractive and seems pretty well made. It seems as though it will do a pretty good job at removing dirt etc. from shoes as the bristles on it are very tough and the crevaces are alot bigger than you can see in the picture. This would cost at least $10 more in the stores. Thinking about buying one for my other 2 entry doors	pos
Okay, here is the major problem with this release: it is not a TuffGong/Island release. The Marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time. Because Bob's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that American and European recording artists have enjoyed for decades, his recordings have gone onto the cheap market (flea markets, push carts, gas stations, etc-and now Amazon). Buying One Love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the Jamaican economy. Look closely at the albums before you buy them. Find out what label has produced them and try to stick with TuffGong when possible.	neg
 I was pleased at the methods used to train your dogs from puppy to mature dogs.  IT covers several different styles of training, clicker and others.

Blinx can be very time consuming for us older xBox players (whom didn't grow up with a controller in our hands).  I found Blinx to be fun, entertaining and challenging.

 --- Simplify, simplify, simplify! That's what I try to do with my beauty routine. Hence, I was first attracted to LAURA MERCIER'S facial cleanser by its name "ONE-STEP CLEANSER."  ---  --- I'm staying with it because it works.

I have been a loyal fan of Quicken for many years.  My, things have changed for the worst at the once mighty Intuit.  It pains me to report that Quicken Deluxe 2007 is a work in progress. ---  ---  --- 1. The installation CD was unreadable.  To Intuit's credit, I was given access to their download site for replacement software. ---  --- 2. The reconciliation report (needed for balancing your checkbook) will not display or print for some reason.  All other reports display and print just fine.  Unfortunately, the reconciliation report is the only one I am truely interested in printing.  I am using a Brother HL-5280DW laser printer.  The printer works fine with all other programs, including the old version of Quicken.  Again, the most important report (reconciliation) will not print on Quicken Deluxe 2007. ---  --- 3.  The software would not recognize the C-drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive (?) - go figure. ---  --- 4.  The overseas Tech Support is willing to play dumb and pretend they don't know there is a problem with the software, keeping you in the chat room for hours.  I guess as long as they get paid it doesn't matter whether they help or not.  The ultimate recommendation is to reload the software - just one more time. ---  --- As a past happy user of Quicken 2004, I was forced into this upgrade. --- Don't expect the problems to be resolved quickly.  Intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months. ---  --- I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this version of quicken is just that BAD NEWS	neg
I recently purchased this lumbar support cushion as a gift for my father this past Christmas.  I am a physical therapist, and have over 5 years of experience dealing primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and disc dysfunction.  I have tried out many cushions over the years, and from my experience, this product is as good as any higher-priced product of the same intent.  The composite board insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained, so the cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of consistent use, and the burgundy cover is removable and washable.  It is also an excellent size for the average-sized person (my dad is approximately 5'9", ~170 lbs.).  It provides good side-bolster support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the outiside of the lower back.  I highly recommend this cushion when placed in comparison of other similar products.  Most of the other products out there that are in contention with this one are composed of unnecessary additives, like a massager, ribbing on the contours of the cushion, etc.  I've found that simply maintaining good posture (not only in sitting, but all activity) allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back into daily life.  Again, I highly recommend this product to anyone out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back pain; however, I must caution that commercial products are NOT a cure-all to one's problems.  It's always possible to alleviate the pain and symptoms, but other steps are necessary in terms of FIXING the problem.  I highly recommend seeking out professional care from a physical therapist, as it is more than likely necessary that one would need (at least) proper education and intevention to help one to get better. 	pos

Super simple to install, and easy to use.  This program gives you a real perspective of how you use your money.  I created a "personal" account company.

 A friend introduced me to this fun magazine.  Without being ponderous, it has more useful and accessible information than I've seen in one food or wine journal in a long time.  I've learned practical things like not to buy the econony sized vermouth, 'cause it won't keep well once opened, or the best sparkling ciders, what wine to bring as a dinner party gift, and why Guinness tastes better in Ireland. It has great virtual trips - like to Thailand, Oaxaco, and Jamaica woven around the theme of the liquid pleasures produced in each country - everything from tea to rum, or chocolate. I find it humanizes the products from all over the world that I take for granted - while giving me imaginative ways to serve them. When CNN starts to drown me with bad news, this snappy mag is as refreshing as Thai iced tea or a tall Vermouth cassis	pos
For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie	neg
I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however. ---  --- I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe. ---  --- My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter).  ---  --- Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)	pos

I am by no means a pro at taking pictures, but this camera makes me look close to it. So far I have just used it as a point and shoot and the pictures have been of really good quality. I am tring to learn more of the functions and one I have run across so far that I enjoy is you can choose in certain functions for your photo to be black and white, color, or sepia. I am not high tech but I can use this camera pretty easily. My first digital camera was a canon digital elf with only 3.2 mega pixels and there is a huge difference in the quality of the pictures when you compare. So if you can affored to spend more for more mega pixels do it. The only down sides I have seen so far is it doesn't come w/ a great memory card which most do not and I imagine if I did not have small hands that the camera would be a little awkward to handle. It has lots of buttons and dials so you have to hold just right so that you don't hit any. But overal I am very satisfied w/ my purchase and hope to become a better photographer with the help of this camera. Canon cameras have served my family and I very well over the years	pos
This gel-based mascara does an excellent job of creating long, separate, and well defined but natural lashes. If you like your mascara to have some oomph to it, you would want to look elsewhere. For those who can't stand a single clump, you may have found your new favorite! If you've ever gotten a mascara in a slender green tube in a Clinique 'gift with purchase' - this is the one. The one you buy is in a slender and slightly larger silver tube.  You can brush on coat after coat of this gel like wonder and not get a single clump! Wow! This mascara is fiber-free and has been opththalmologist approved for contact lens wearers. The Jet Black is a true black and the Jet Brown is noticeably brown on the wand but looks great on the lashes. As with all long wearing eye makeup products such as mascara, this one needs to be removed with an eye makeup remover.	pos
I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on "Satanic Majesties", and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the "Rock n Roll Circus". A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read	neg

This camera is incredibly frustrating.  I must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  However, photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired.  If you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light, this is not the camera for you.  The reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect, the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably.  Since the camera does not have very good image stabilization (if any) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon.  Of course you can use the flash, but then your subject will be overlit, while the background is pitch dark.  And forget about taking long range pictures indoors (i.e. at a graduation ceremony or wedding) because if the flash is on, you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance, it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on.  If it is off, your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1-2 seconds.  Since I take alot of indoor pictures, this camera is worthless to me.  If you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light, this is the camera for you.  If you want to do any natural light photography, forget it. 	neg
I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. --- Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says "Here, this is the only way out."  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. --- When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. --- So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying	neg

This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of. ---  --- Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of "production notes" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.  ---  --- All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster.	neg
As a former history major and teacher I am very familiar with the history of the Crusades from the Western point of view.  They have been portrayed in literature, movies, and history.  They have been glamorized and vilified by Westerners for centuries.  Reading Amin Maalouf's rendering of this familiar story from the view-point of Arab chroniclers was like looking through Alice's looking glass at a world that is backwards from the one we know.  Here we don't have just Crusaders, advernturers, or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray, but invaders, barbarians, and enemies of God Himself.   ---  --- This book is a must read for everyone who is concerned about events in the Middle East today.  It sheds light on a crucial time in history that affects the psyche of Muslims who are living right now.  Especially helpful is the epilogue in which Maalouf explains how the collective memory of the Crusades colors the way many Middle-easterners see the West.  It is not riveting, but very readable considering it is a translation.  I enjoyed it and learned a lot	pos
I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!	neg
So many disbelievers out there! I feel so sorry for you: no magic left in your dull and predictable worlds? Of course this book is on the level. While my dog Ernestine does not build art pieces as such, she's a pretty good cook and a crack shot. So why not dog artists? The review of dog art is a little species-centric, however. Most of the dog artists I know use faecies or urine to construct art, or engage in performance pieces: "Rooting The Leg"; and "Licking The Balls" spring to mind. Dog culture can be appreciated by humans but is not the SAME as human cuture. So a little less chauvanism please Ms Mathison	pos
This science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person. Articles are good, not overly technical in depth. At times it gets in its doldrums of articles, but generally it holds it own. You don't have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same. But it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot. It does at times takes some thought of getting used to. Their 'special topic issues' may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic.Well received for the high-schooler either as the magazine or the website. At least the layperson can be science informed. The title of the magazine says it all	pos

It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.

I LOVE Lola lip gloss, it isn't too tacky, lasts a long time, and the colors are gorgeous.  I bought the Fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that I bought La Petite Menagerie as a replacement.

(Husband writing review:) I use my Lodge Sportsman as often as possible, but sometimes it still has to go into storage for a while. This is a rugged cover that is custom fit, and I appreciate how much cleaner my grill is when I pull it out.

First of all I do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer !!! So I will not go into anything technical.  I will leave that to people who know more than I do. But what I am is an international traveler.  I simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with "snapshots".  I wanted someting much better, and boy did I get it with this camera.  I looked at the D70s and since I have very small hands, I could never feel comfortable holding it.  This camera is smaller without being small.  I have only taken photos locally, but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start.  The built in editing features (filters etc.) are wonderful to work with.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than "point and shoot" snap shots	pos

First off, let me say that I know next to nothing about art.  I would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork, but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art.  Dali, however, is a master I at least have some affinity with.  Who doesn't know of the melting clocks?  I have also seen the dream sequence he created for Hitchcock's film Spellbound in 1945.  Plus, the guy was just plain weird, and that is something I know a little bit about myself. ---  --- This Artists of the 20th Century DVD looks solely at Dali's artwork.  All you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another.  There is no biographical look at the man, no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings, and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality (or mustache).  There is not even an adequate identification of Gala, his inspiration and muse, despite numerous references to her in his paintings.  Thus, this DVD will not introduce you to Dali the man or Dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro. ---  --- Dali's artwork is obviously impressive, and I was surprised by the variety of his work and styles.  The narrator offers insight into some paintings - others, you just look and advance.  I don't understand a lot of Dali's work, nor can I see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces.  The melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me.  Dark works such as Visage of War speak volumes to the human observer, and the disappearing bust of Voltaire paintings are also striking.   I was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces Dali painted, however - largely because I did not know he ever produced such works.  My idea of a painting equates with something like Design for the Interior Decoration of a Stable-Library, which is a strikingly beautiful work. ---  --- Is this DVD worth watching?  I will have to say No.  If you're a know-nothing novice like me, there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown.  If you're knowledgeable about Dali, you'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite Dali works excluded from the show.  After watching this, I decided to peruse some Dali galleries online, and I must say that the Internet makes this DVD of little value.  Not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video, the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the DVD	neg
This is the 7th Olympus camera I've owned over the years, from film to digital.  I have always been very pleased with Olympus cameras and their usual superior optics.  This camera, though, is a major disappointment, mainly because even though it can shoot in RAW, there is no compatible conversion available yet, leaving you unable to process RAW images.  This renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in JPEG.  Olympus should have ensured that vendors such as Adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible RAW conversion Plug-ins available before this camera hit the market.  There's no excuse for Olympus to not have made sure this was the case, indeed it's downright irresponsible. ---  --- Having said the above, the camera lens is quite nice, the camera itself operates well.  You can take quite good pictures.  However, the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low-light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken----if you're taking pictures of people, they will have moved by the time the picture is taken. ---  --- The battery life is very good.  The camera fits nicely in your palm. And, having a 28 - 500 mm lens is great.   ---  --- If you don't shoot in RAW and you don't depend on flash photography, the camera is worth a look.  Otherwise, look at other products at this time	neg

I owned a Kodak for awhile and was pleased with the pictures however, my husband accidently fell while ice skating and broke my camera.  My family, knowing I love to take pictures, decided to replace my camera, but this time with a Sony Cybershot.  I have never been more unhappy with a camera.  Needless to say, I finally decided to purchase this Kodak Z650 and am so pleased with the results and pictures. ---  --- I am not a professional photographer, just someone who likes to take photos of my kids, pets, flowers, vacation spots, etc.  My Sony was HORRIBLE at action shots and if you had ANY movement what so ever, the photo appeared blurry.  Having kids, that isn't an option.  I gave that camera to my daughter to do whatever she wanted with it.  The Kodak, however does a wonderful job of action shots as well as clear, crisp and concise pictures.  I absolutely love this camera!   ---  --- I will never go back to another brand and have only good things to say about Kodak and their products	pos

Building on the Intuitive QuickBooks Pro interface and SQL database, QuickBooks Premier enables firms to scale - merely by clicking on a button and paying the difference. This ensures no work is lost. There is a whole new menu dedicated to specific Industries. While the estimate can have multiple options, when the customer places an order, the Sales Order function enables QuickBooks to saddle up for the ride. It generates Purchase Orders with the click of a button, and when goods are received, keeps track of who it is for. Invoices are generated from the sales order as well, and partial invoicing keeps track so I don't leave money on the table. I use the email function all the time, sending pdf attachments and cc:g myself so there's a time stamp.  ---  --- To address the problem of sharing large files, there is a new Portable Company File (much like a Zip file) which compresses files for emailing.  --- I have also grown to appreciate the online banking auto-reconciliation function - I log in to the bank every morning, and watch as transactions appear and then get matched with my books, leaving me only unreconciled transactions.  ---  --- QuickBooks also enables integration with third party software - there is a legion of industry specific solutions that help with core business operations. With 2006, QuickBooks has moved from being a software to a Business Operations System	pos

This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES.  The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??	neg
This disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs, heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...Corey's voice is below average....I get the feeling that Corey Clark is IMITATING a good singer with a VIABLE career, and not doing it very well....clearly 'fake it till you make it' isn't working here.  The songs all sound the same, I kept waiting for something to get me grooving, but it just didn't happen.   ---  --- I think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons, a little humility, and some professional grooming (and I don't mean clothing).  	neg
In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create. --- What the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective: NOT to choose sides.  The Catholic Croats and the Muslims are the "victims," while the Orthodox Serbs are wholly to blame...  That is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a "noble cause."  There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda! --- A more balanced and objective approach (i.e. there are no good guys and bad guys in such conflicts) with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one. --- Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it); that is to say that the cast are badly in need of acting lessons (with the exception of Woody Harrelson)!  The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...  School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad... --- Yet another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame. --- In conclusion, the potential for a good movie was there if only the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...  	neg
This used to be a pretty decent music magazine.  Not the best that was out there, but still decent.  However, Rolling Stone has taken a huge nose-dive in the past ten or so years.  I'm not sure I'd even really call it a music magazine anymore.  It's more a pop-culture magazine that panders to teeny-boppers.  A music magazine's main focus should be music, but RS has over the years started including more and more articles on TV shows, movies, politics, etc and less and less on music...especially less and less on good music.  If you want a magazine on pop-culture go with Entertainment Weekly.  It, at least, has a bit of taste here and there and doesn't spout off about politics.  If I want politics, I'll read the newspaper or watch CNN.  I don't buy music magazines for politics.  I buy them for music.  If you want a good music magazine, this isn't the place to look anymore.	neg
MSR's Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker.  Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable. --- If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread.  Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking	pos
I just recently purchased the Red Variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of Apocalypse.  But as I was setting him up, trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. Hence the 2 star durability rating. I have never had this problem with the Legends line before, and was very disappointed, especially since it was the variant figure. Some superglue fixed the problem, but at the cost of some articulation. He is on my shelf now and looks great, but if you're giving the toy to younger children, be cautious. Like I said I have never had any problems like this with a Marvel Legends Figure before, so hopefully it was just a fluke. --- The figure is still well worth getting, and in fact I am going to pick up the Green version sometime in the near future	neg
I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player). ---  --- I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool. ---  --- Absolutley buy this unit.  I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it	pos

I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself.  I haven't found a single one.  All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these "designers" heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman?  I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place.  If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit?  Young people are smarter than you think	neg

"Red Water," a made for television film starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Kristy Swanson, carries on the now long and wearisome tradition of ripping off "Jaws." You would think that nearly thirty years after Steven Spielberg's project arrived in theaters filmmakers and producers might move on to another genre. You would be wrong. Every year brings us even more "animal gone wild" flicks, everything from sharks, octopi, whales, snakes, bears, rats, ants, birds, cats, dogs, dinosaurs, crocodiles, alligators, and genetic laboratory experiments gone horribly awry ripping their way through a fresh crop of hapless humans. If the creature in question has sharp teeth, claws, wings, talons, tentacles, and pincers expect to see the monster in question appear in a low budget, straight to video knockoff of "Jaws." Sure, there are elaborations to the standard plot lines, none of which significantly improves these rip-offs, but all of them owe a big debt to Steven Spielberg's film. For example, "Red Water" tries something a little different by having a freshwater shark terrorize people on a Louisiana River. It also inserts a plot thread about a gang of criminals recovering a stash of money from the riverbed. None of these ideas disguises what is really going on. ---  --- "Red Water" is the story of John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips), a down on his luck fisherman with an ex-wife, horrific memories of a disaster from his days as an oil drilling technician, and loans on his boat he can't afford to repay. At the same time Sanders dithers with the bank about his delinquent loan payments, a shark somehow manages to enter the river and promptly wreaks havoc on swimmers, fishermen, and anyone else who manages to get in the way. Sanders could care less about the shark, primarily because he doesn't know about it at first and also because his ex-wife Kelli (Kristy Swanson) just walked back into his life. She's a scientist working for some big oil company that is drilling for natural gas on the river, and she knows that John is an expert on this sort of thing. Whether you buy the idea that a scientist would go by the name "Kelli" is another matter. Sanders eventually agrees to help out when he learns that the oil executives will pay him handsomely for his troubles. After all, he'll do just about anything to bring in enough cash to keep his boat. What none of these people know is that they will run headlong into several sharks, one that swims and several that walk around on two legs. ---  --- The movie switches focus long enough to tell us about some Jamaican criminal who lost a ton of money in the river when one of his underlings dropped the box containing the cash in the water while eluding the authorities. This guy hires some mercenary thug, along with a goon named Ice (Coolio), to go track down the subordinate in an effort to persuade him to reveal the location of the cash. And wouldn't you know it? The site just happens to lie right near the oilrig where Sanders and Kelli eventually show up! What follows is incredibly predictable: the criminals take over Sanders's vessel because they think these guys angling for the money, a disaster occurs on the rig that claims the lives of several workers, and the shark turns up to chow down on a few of the principals. How predictable is "Red Water"? Not only is there a Cajun chap helping out on Sanders's boat, we get a few scenes of a Cajun party complete with music and dancing. Just in case you aren't aware that you should laugh at these hicks, the script throws in a few lines comparing the party to "Deliverance." How clever and original is that? I'm starting to get real tired of seeing this sort of prejudice in films and television shows. If you put any minority group in the place of these Cajuns and did the same thing, the outcry would be deafening. ---  --- It's not the overt prejudice of the Cajun scenes that sinks "Red Water"; it's everything else. The venerable Lou Diamond Phillips hasn't made a good film since...well...I can't recall, actually. I quit following his career after "The First Power." As for Kristy Swanson, I was surprised to see her here. I remember her star rising in the early to mid 1990s, but at some point she fell off the radar and, if "Red Water" is any indication, into B-movie purgatory. It's sad, really, because she's not that bad of an actress. Coolio, on the other hand, goes over the top in his role as a thug looking for some money. If I had known from the start that this guy was in the film, I wouldn't have watched it. Aside from the performances, or the lack thereof, the production values are low, the pace drags, and the film has the propensity to put the strangest dialogue in its characters' mouths. I really, really wish I had written down some of the odd lines uttered by Phillips's character. I remember watching the movie and thinking at the time, "I should write that down and use it later in a review." For some reason, I didn't. Probably because I just wanted this thing to end quickly. ---  --- In another bizarre turn, the movie carries a 'R' rating even though there isn't much bloody carnage going on. The only extras on the disc, fortunately, are trailers for "Bats," "The Big Hit," and "Ride or Die." If you're really interested in watching creatures attack flicks, there are plenty of other bad movies to choose from, most of them unintentionally hilarious schlockfests that manage to entertain on some level. "Red Water" is too bland, too confused plot wise, and too full of actors on the downhill slide of their careers to be entertaining. If you decide to head up this river, good luck to you.   ---  ---  ---  	neg

I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand. ---  --- The watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use. ---  --- In the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations. ---  --- All in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.  I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller	pos
The pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic. My daughter's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage, which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse. After asking Santa for a Cinderella Castle she was a bit disappointed. This playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it	neg
While one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool, the manufacture has indeed done so. The "spoon" portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil. I supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility, but instead of using a fastener or weld, its just rolled metal inserted into the coil. After only two uses the "spoon" came out of the coil and even though I could easily enough put it back together, after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay. Basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now. Would recommend buying a more simply designed, single piece shoe horn. 	neg
These 2 guys playing Harry and Lloyd were so disastrous. They didn't even know how to act corny when they're supposed to.  ---  --- Jim Carrey might be crazy at times but I don't think he's this bad. The whole thing looked like monkeys flying around the screen. Nevertheless, it has some funny moments like when Jessica's parents found all the poo sticking all over the toilet. ---  --- The whole idea of a 'special class' was just so stupid. Nothing made sense. I didn't see a single point of the whole plot in the first place just to get a little extra cash. ---  --- The first one was a lot better than this one. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were a lot dumber and a lot funnier. These 2 were worse than dumb and weren't even funny at all. ---  --- I guess 'Dumb and Dumberer' would be better if it were still Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels starring but nooo, it had to be these 2 who I don't even know.  ---  --- Please don't watch it guys. It may be funny for some guys but it's mostly corny like kindergarteners gone wild. Watch the first one!!! ---  --- Kirstie Mabita	neg
For better or worse, after the relative box-office slump of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, producers Brocolli and Saltzman decided to woo Sean Connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum.  Connery, who had said he would never do another Bond film, donated all of his money to his own foundation.  While his performance is competent and smooth as ever, he seems all business.  No longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant, Connery mechanically works his way through DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, an outright bore of the Bond series and, in my opinion, one of the worst (certainly Connery's worst).  While some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the Bond genre, it plainly isn't.  It was an attempt to return Bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers.  Far from trying to lampoon the Bond formula, the producers were trying to resuscitate it.  And they failed.   ---  --- After the opening "gun barrel" sequence, we quickly find Bond on a personal mission to kill Blofeld once and for all after the death of Bond's only true wife (discounting the false marriage in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.  (At least, this is what we must assume, since no mention of the marriage is made in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER).  Bond catches Blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and, after a couple of struggles with both Blofeld and a duplicate, Bond drowns Blofeld in a vat of mud.  It is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence.  The titles involves various diamonds, slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women, all set to the title song sung by Shirley Bassey (who also sang the GOLDFINGER title).   ---  --- The plot of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is quite strange.  In an opening similar to GOLDFINGER, we learn that large quantities of South African diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet, surprisingly, have not made their way to the market.  Worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market, Bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation, disguised as Peter Franks.  Bond quickly succeeds, meeting up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of Bond's identity.  Bond's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real Peter Franks makes an entrance, forcing Bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  After a smuggling attempt goes awry (thanks to Bond), Bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating.  It turns out that Blofeld is behind it all (Bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser)!  Blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on Earth.  Blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world, and using Whyte's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser.  Blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in America, Russia, and China.  The purpose?  Blofeld is organizing an international auction, offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder!  Will Bond be able to stop him in time?   ---  --- DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER feels like a film that was stitched together, rather poorly, from a myriad of interesting elements.  One feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order.  The infiltration of a smuggling ring, the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator, the quirky and gay hitmen Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith), a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous Las Vegas recluse Howard Hughes, a fight on an oil rig, et cetera.  All of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right, but the combination doesn't yield what the producers were hoping for.  What is it about this film that feels so ridiculous?  One of the major problems, in my opinion, is situating Bond in Las Vegas.  Bond in America is dull.  His class, wit, and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  Bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations--not to a strip club.  Furthermore, the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series.  I think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which Bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd.  The chase is boring, the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque, and there is no suspense.  The climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring.  Sure, we have a big set and big explosions.  But there is no cutting edge stuff here.  ---  --- Connery, as mentioned, looks very tired here.  Tiffany Case is a bit refreshing, but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull.  And the Bond girl with the clever name, Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) is only in the film for all of five minutes.  Blofeld is now played by Charles Gray, who first made his appearance as Bond's Japan contact in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.  Gray's performance takes Blofeld back to the ridiculousness of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, even appearing in drag at one point.   There isn't much more to say.  The acting is dead in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.   ---  --- Now, some have tried to defend DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the Bond genre.  After producing six Bond films, the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move Bond into the Roger Moore pun-fest the series would eventually become.  While this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film, it seems plainly false.  If you watch the "Making of" documentary on the Ultimate Edition, it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real Bond flick and not a parody.  The producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success.  They were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the Bond formula.  Anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization.  This film stinks.  Let's get over it.   ---  --- Ultimately, I think you should skip DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.  The only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order.  It is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between Sean Connery and Roger Moore.  The Ultimate Edition does have crisp picture and sound.  If you must struggle through the film, make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable.  But if you only desire to watch the better Bond films, skip it.  Diamonds may be forever, but this film died a long time ago.  	neg
All 3 WIWAG are excellent. This is more than just a well put together documentary. Its very moving because of the footage, narration and music. You don't feel like you are watching a DVD about baseball. It feels like you are watching a snapshot of Americana from the 50's and 60's. After watching this, you wish that things today were as they were back in those days. Not just baseball or sports, but life in general as it was protrayed in the DVDs	pos
The software does a lot of great things.  You can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks.  The system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that, it is great software	pos
It is a little smaller than I expected...But I guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand. Other than that, It's perfect. My son's room has an Atlanta Braves theme so the colors are perfect. The main reason I bought this was to use as a toy box. So far, it's worked out great! I don't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small don't bother me. The only thing I have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank.	pos
This remote temperature sensor works in conjunction with the base unit and permits you to monitor the outdoor temp and humidity as well as the indoor temp, anywhere in your house. I keep the base unit in my bedroom and can then tell both the outdoor temp and the lower level indoor temps when getting dressed for the day. I think the system works very well for a reasonable cost	pos

Not speaking or understanding Tibetian, didn't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie, and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why. It guides you like a sherpa, gently leading you along the high trails, powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air. You are at once engulfed in the Tibetian life, you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants, singing bowls, and drums	pos

In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television, a truimphant (but short-lived) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.  ---  --- It doesn't hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH PATIENT. As such, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER gloriously lives up to its titular billing. John Hurt's performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as, propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make-up, he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich, witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. The kids, of course, won't have that frame of reference, but, still, watching these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around the fire, enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns.  ---  --- Michael Gambon, on the other hand, is burdened with the weightier and grimmer Greek tales. Thus, he eschews John Hurt's light, ebullient touch, opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona. He's pretty good, mind you, but, in the final analysis, he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to John Hurt. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson).  ---  --- At a half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values, coming up with excellent special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry, matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series, which adds a nice touch, is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the Storyteller and his dog. The camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but, somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup, images depicting the story are set in motion. Pretty neat.  ---  --- The stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid's fable we're used to over here, especially the Greek entries, and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones ("The Soldier and Death," "The Heartless Giant"). But don't keep the kids from watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories.  ---  --- It does help that most of these tales are little known in the States, thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there. When was the last time CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offer up anything new? This is just about as perfect as television shows can get; the only flaw I can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever. ALL the episodes are superb, but if I had to pick the best of the pack, I would definitely go with "Hans My Hedgehog," "The Soldier and Death" and "The Three Ravens." With several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION truly is a MUST HAVE dvd set. ---  --- ************************************************************************** ---  --- SPOILERS follow. The nine European fables: ---  --- "Hans My Hedgehog" - From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman, desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers.  ---  --- "Fearnot" - From an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear. Though still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot. Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role. ---  --- "A Story Short" - From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block. Brenda Blethyn has a part. ---  --- "The Luck Child" - From an early Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies.  ---  --- The Soldier & Death" - From an early Russian folk tale, this is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars, an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil Death. ---  --- "The True Bride" - From an early German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean. ---  --- "The Three Ravens" - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then, recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms forever. ---  --- "Sapsorrow" - From an early German folk tale: This is a variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?) as a beautiful princess (the unimpressive Alison Doody), seeking to escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in love with the prince...Co-starring Jennifer Saunders. ---  --- "The Heartless Giant" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole, giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course, the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king's dungeon... ---  --- The Greek myths:  ---  --- "Daedalus and Icarus" - The inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not. ---  --- "Orpheus and Eurydice" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back his dead wife. ---  --- "Perseus and the Gorgon" - The hero Perseus faces the Gorgon, Medusa. ---  --- "Theseus and the Minotaur" - It's Theseus, with some help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage Minotaur, half-man, half-bull.	pos

When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture.  --- After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever.  --- The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures! --- They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera.	neg

I'm a little surprised by the bad reviews.  I have used mine for years though I did wear one out after about 80 uses airing up four large truck tires from 12 psi to 35 psi through a 150psi, 2.5 gal tank.   ---  --- I have it hard-mounted in my Jeep.  It pressurizes an air tank which is connected to chucks at both ends of the Jeep.  I start the compressor near the end of the trail and by the time we stop the air tank is at full pressure.  Then I connect a hose to one of the air chucks and start airing up tires.   ---  --- The compressor runs into the tank and the tank feeds the hose.  I can usually air one tire up in about 30 seconds this way.  The compressor doesn't catch up with this makes it much easier to work - everything is up out of the way and all I have to manage is the hose.  In between tires I can stop to talk and let the compressor fill the tank again.  Or I can air up the next tire. ---  --- This unit will not last forever and does not like to be handled roughly.  I have only handled the plug once - to plug it in when I bolted it to the Jeep permanently.  So I don't have the plug problems. ---  --- It is noisy but it is the sound you want to hear when you need air.  I remember one night helping a friend who had a flat. They were very grateful to hear that sound and see their tire come back to life. ---  --- If you want an industrial strength unit, you are going to have to spend several hundred dollars.  This unit keeps up well with an ARB compressor that costs four times as much.  Treat it well and it will treat you well	pos

I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels great.  I personally like the COPPER version a little better than the SILVER version.  It's a little gentler and softer but I know some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are fragil and I would risk damaging them.  It also feels really good on the back and actually all over, not just on the head	pos
